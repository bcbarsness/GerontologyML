       "'Purpose:\\u2002Researchers\\' knowledge regarding older users of illicit drugs is limited despite the increasing numbers of users. In this article, we apply a life course perspective to gain a further understanding of older adult drug use, specifically contrasting early- and late-onset heroin users.\\u2003Design and Methods:We collected qualitative data from 29 older heroin users. Life course analysis focused on the users\\' experiences across the life span.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002The findings suggest that those aging into heroin use (late onset) are disadvantaged compared to those who are maturing in (early onset) except in areas of health.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We propose that conceptualizing the use of heroin and other illicit drugs among older adults based on the user\\'s life course trajectory will provide insights for social and health services, including drug treatment. Purpose:\\u2002Individual expectations among community-dwelling older adults and their subsequent effect on placement status have recently been considered. Previous studies, however, have been limited by eligibility and exclusion criteria, treating expectations as a continuous measure, omitting potential confounders, and ignoring Race × Gender interactions. Design and Methods: We used data on 6,242 Black or White self-respondents who were 70 years old or older when they were enrolled in the survey of Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old. We modeled expectations for nursing home placement over the next 5 years, as well as actual placement status, by using multivariable multinomial and binomial logistic regression models. Results: Expectations are not normally distributed: 14% of the participants refused to answer, 51% estimated no chance, 10% indicated a 1% to 50% chance, 21% indicated an 11% to 50% chance and 4% indicated a 51% to 100% chance. Age, gender, education, social supports, and health status were associated with expectations, as well as an interaction effect for Black men. Age, social supports, health status, prior hospital or nursing home use, and expectations were associated with subsequent placement. Implications:\\u2002Black and White older adults\\' expectations for nursing home placement rationally reflect their individual risk profiles and are associated with subsequent placement status. The expectations question may facilitate the early identification of high-risk individuals for further evaluation. Purpose: Turnover in nursing homes is a widespread problem adversely affecting care quality. Using complexity theory, we tested the effect of administrative climate, communication patterns, and the interaction between the two on turnover, controlling for facility context. Design and Methods: Perceptions of administrative climate and communication were collected from 3,449 employees in 164 randomly sampled nursing homes, and they were linked to secondary data on facility characteristics, resource allocation, and turnover. We used hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. Results: Climate and communication both affected turnover, but lower turnover was dependent on the interaction between climate and communication. In nursing homes with reward-based administrative climates, higher levels of communication openness and accuracy explained lower turnover of licensed vocational nurses and certified nurse assistants, relative to nursing homes with an ambiguous climate. Adequate staffing and longer tenure of the nursing director were also important predictors of turnover. Implications: Although context is important, managers can also influence turnover by addressing climate and communication patterns and by encouraging stable nursing leadership. Case studies are used extensively in gerontological and geriatric education and practice, especially to present clinically relevant examples and to illustrate abstract concepts, principles, and theories in the study of aging. This article reviews the important pedagogical, clinical, and ethical issues involved in their design and use, and presents an argument that both case study developers and discussants need to become more reflective when they think about the nature of writing and listening to case studies as stories. The major themes from the literature in narrative and clinical ethics on case studies as stories are surveyed, including consideration of both facts and values, the debate on generalization versus specificity, and the need for interpreters and commentators. The implications of these insights for teaching and clinical education are considered, including the importance of addressing the need for rich description, multiple voices, open-endedness, and critical analysis. Purpose: We first describe which states have produced nursing home report cards; second, we compare what information is provided in these report cards; third, we identify data sources used to produce the report cards; and, finally, we examine seven factors previously shown to be associated with the usefulness of report-card information and provide several examples from current reporting efforts to illustrate how nursing home report cards could be improved. Design and Methods: We searched the Web sites for each state agency responsible for elder affairs–nursing homes. For those states identified as having a nursing home report card, we further examined the information presented. Results: We identified 19 states as having nursing home report cards (AZ, CO, FL, IL, IN, IO, MD, MA, MS, NV, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, TX, UT, VT, and WI). The information presented in these report cards differs quite substantially across states, although the data sources for report cards do not differ substantially. How the information is presented and our evaluation of the usefulness of the information is also highly varied. Implications: Providing nursing home report-card information may be important in helping elders and their families choose a nursing facility. With 19 states identified in our research as providing nursing home report-card information on the World Wide Web, we were surprised and encouraged at this number of initiatives. We give some insight into the kinds of information that can be found on these report cards and what steps could be taken to improve how the information is presented. Purpose:\\u2002We assessed nursing home staff and state nursing home surveyors regarding their knowledge and attitudes about urinary incontinence, its management, and the revised federal Tag F315 guidance for urinary incontinence.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a questionnaire survey of a convenience sample of nursing home staff and state nursing home surveyors from a midwestern state attending two statewide workshops on the revised guidance.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of 558 attendees, 500 (85%) responded, including 39% of the state\\'s directors of nursing and 57% of state nursing home surveyors. There were striking deficiencies in knowledge regarding urinary incontinence and catheter care, with significant discrepancies by type of respondent, particularly between state surveyors and nursing home staff. Staff cited documentation and staffing levels as the most frequent concerns about implementation. Open-ended responses reflected the divergence of concerns and antagonism among the stakeholders, and staff nurses\\' feeling that F315 violated residents\\' rights.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The revised Tag F315 guidance will be unlikely to improve the quality of urinary incontinence care in nursing homes because of significant knowledge and attitudinal discrepancies between nursing home staff and state surveyors, facility staff\\'s focus on documentation and staffing, and reliance on implementation strategies known to be ineffective. Federal, state, and other urinary incontinence guideline efforts should focus on managerial structures and methods to improve quality nursing home care. Research is needed to address how nursing home residents and families define and value “quality” urinary incontinence management and to incorporate these in quality-improvement strategies and measures. Purpose: Our objective in this study was to compare the quality of care provided under the Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO), a special program designed to serve dually eligible older persons, to care provided to controls who received fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid managed care. Design and Methods: Two control groups were used; one was drawn from nonenrollees living in the same area (Control–In) and another from comparable individuals living in another urban area where the program was not available (Control–Out). Cohorts living in the community and in nursing homes were included. Quality measures for both groups included mortality rates, preventable hospital admissions, and preventable emergency room (ER) visits. For the community group, nursing home admission rates were also tracked. For nursing home residents, quality measures included quality indicators derived from the Minimum Data Set. Results: There were no differences in mortality rates for either cohort. MSHO had fewer short-stay nursing home admissions but no difference for stays 90 days or longer. MSHO community and nursing home residents had fewer preventable hospital and ER visits compared to Control–In. There were no major differences in nursing home quality indicator rates. Implications: The cost of changing the model of care for dual eligibles from a mixture of fee-for-service and managed care to a merged managed-care approach cannot be readily justified by the improvements in quality observed. Purpose: The aim of this study was to validate a pain scale for the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment instrument and examine prevalence of pain in major nursing home subpopulations, including type of admission and cognitive status. Design and Methods: This study considered validation of the MDS pain items and derivation of scale performed against the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), using Automatic Interaction Detection. The derivation data describe 95 postacute care nursing home patients who are able to communicate. The scale is then used in retrospective analysis of 34,675 Michigan nursing home residents. Results: A four-group scale was highly predictive of VAS pain scores (variance explanation 56%) and therefore quite valid in detecting pain. In the prevalence sample, only 47% of postacute patients compared to 63% of postadmission patients reported no pain, and these percentages rose with increasing cognitive impairment. Implications: Pain is prevalent in nursing home residents, especially in those with cognitive dysfunction, and often untreated. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age and patients\\' attribution of incontinence to aging on health-related behaviors associated with incontinence. Design and Methods: Participants in this study were 74 women who either sought treatment for urinary incontinence at a multidisciplinary continence program or volunteered for a randomized clinical trial of behavioral and drug therapy for incontinence. As part of their clinical evaluation, women were interviewed about how they managed their incontinence and their perceptions of what had caused the condition. Self-management of incontinence was defined as behaviors used to cope with incontinence, rather than treat or cure incontinence. Self-treatment was defined as self-implementation of Kegel exercises, and formal treatment was defined as interaction with a health care provider. Results: Over half of the respondents attributed their incontinence to aging. In multivariate analyses, age was associated with self-management of incontinence, but not self-treatment or formal treatment. In contrast, attribution of incontinence to aging was associated with self-management and self-treatment of incontinence. There was also a trend for attribution of incontinence to aging to be associated with formal treatment for incontinence. Women who attributed their incontinence to aging were less likely to have engaged in self-management strategies and to have received a previous evaluation or treatment; but, they were more likely to have engaged in self-treatment for incontinence. When other relevant variables were added to the regression models, perception that incontinence restricted one\\'s activities became the most significant predictor of performing self-management strategies and performing Kegel exercises. Implications: Attribution to aging may be an impediment to seeking treatment. Education to promote understanding of the actual causes and treatment of urinary incontinence may encourage people to seek appropriate intervention. Additionally, whereas attribution to aging is an important factor contributing to health-related behaviors, other factors, such as perception that one\\'s activities are restricted, may play an important role. To meet the special needs of and provide quality health care to nursing home residents, the health care workforce must be knowledgeable about the aging process. Health professionals are minimally prepared in their academic programs to care for older adults, and few programs have required rotations in geriatrics. Teaching nursing homes (TNHs) have shown promise as sites for the preparation of a health workforce to care for older adults in nursing homes as well as improvement of quality outcomes. This article reports on the process and recommendations of a TNH summit of experts in geriatric education and practice as to the feasibility of developing a sustainable and replicable TNH model that would prepare a professional workforce knowledgeable about and prepared to work in long-term care. The TNH summit identified characteristics of partnerships between academia, nursing home(s), and other stakeholders that would constitute a successful TNH collaboration. Goals of a TNH partnership between service and academia include interdisciplinary education and practice, research and dissemination of evidence-based practices, and benchmarks of a nursing home professional learning environment. Purpose: Public-use datasets can extend data collected by individual investigators in various ways: making external comparisons, providing additional data on individual respondents, and creating internal comparison groups. The authors describe the advantages and limitations of these methods and practical and conceptual issues in combining investigator-initiated and public-use datasets. Design and Methods: These issues are illustrated with a study of functional decline among 674 patients following hospitalization for hip fracture that was augmented with data from a public-use dataset, the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Results:By creating an internal comparison group of EPESE respondents, frequency matched to hip fracture patients on age, sex, and baseline functional limitations, the authors formed a single dataset and performed multivariable analyses of factors associated with functional decline. Implications: Gerontological research may benefit by applying these methods to program evaluations and longitudinal analyses of health outcomes with numerous public-use datasets. Purpose: Considering the increasing proportion of residents in long-term care who have dementia, and the important influence that direct care providers have on resident quality of life, this study explores the dementia-related attitudes of residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) and nursing home staff, as well as their work stress and satisfaction. Design and Methods: Data were derived from interviews with 154 direct care providers from 31 RC/AL facilities and 10 nursing homes who participated in the Collaborative Studies of Long-Term Care. Results: Stress was more often reported by care providers who had been working for 1 to 2 years (compared with longer); in addition, those who had been working for 1 to 2 years were more likely to espouse hopeful or person-centered attitudes than those who had been working for a longer period of time. Also, a person-centered attitude related to satisfaction, and perceived competence in providing dementia care was consistently associated with dementia-sensitive attitudes and job satisfaction. Implications: Attending to the welfare and ongoing training of workers who have demonstrated job commitment may lessen their tendency to become jaded over time or seek job opportunities elsewhere. Further, the attitudes the staff hold related to dementia and the training they receive to provide dementia care are important for their own well-being. Purpose: Denmark is cited as a model in the development of home- and community-based systems for the frail elderly population. We examined the results of this natural experiment and considered implications for U.S. policy. Design and Methods: We used international comparative policy analysis, including site visits and semistructured interviews with Danish leadership in conjunction with a review of published literature, reports, and administrative data from Denmark and the United States. Results: After 12 years of implementing integrated systems for home- and community-based services in 275 municipalities, growth in Danish long-term care expenditures has leveled off; expenditures appear to be decreasing for the over-80 population and have dropped as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Access to and quality of long-term care services appear to remain generally satisfactory. During this period, comparable expenditures in the United States have increased, and deficits in access and quality persist. Implications: These findings should be of interest to state and federal policy makers considering strategies to reduce the rate of growth in Medicaid and Medicare expenditures for elders and to expand home- and community-based services. Purpose:\\u2002Residential care/assisted living describes diverse facilities providing non–nursing home care to a heterogeneous group of primarily elderly residents. This article derives typologies of assisted living based on theoretically and practically grounded evidence.Design and Methods:\\u2002We obtained data from the Collaborative Studies of Long-Term Care, which examined 193 assisted living facilities in four states: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, and North Carolina. By using mixture modeling, we derived typologies in five different ways, based on: structure; process; resident case-mix; structure and process; and structure, process, and resident case-mix.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Although configurations of typologies varied as a function of criterion variables used, common themes emerged from different cluster solutions. A typology based on resident case-mix yielded a five-cluster solution, whereas a typology based on structure, process, and resident case-mix resulted in six distinct clusters. Medicaid case-mix/psychiatric illness and high resident impairment were two clusters identified by both strategies.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Because of the wide variation in structure, residents, and services within assisted living facilities, typologies such as those described here may be useful in clinical practice, research, and policy. To the extent that public payment defines its own cluster, the potential for inequities in care merits careful attention. Purpose: We explain a new concept, positive spirituality, and offer evidence that links positive spirituality with health; describe effective partnerships between health professionals and religious communities; and summarize the information as a basis for strengthening the existing successful aging model proposed by Rowe and Kahn. Design and Methods: A missing component to Rowe and Kahn\\'s three-factor model of successful aging is identified, and we propose strengthening the model with a fourth factor, positive spirituality. Results: We developed an enhanced model of successful aging based on Rowe and Kahn\\'s theoretical framework. Evidence presented suggests that the addition of spirituality to interventions focused on health promotion has been received positively by older adults. Implications: Leaders in gerontology often fail to incorporate the growing body of scientific evidence regarding health, aging, and spirituality into their conceptual models to promote successful aging. The proposed enhancement of Rowe and Kahn\\'s model will help health professionals, religious organizations, and governmental agencies work collaboratively to promote wellness among older adults. Purpose: This study explored factors that are related to the level of contact (number of visits and calls) between newly admitted nursing home residents and their family and friends. In addition to reexamining factors studied previously, several new factors were explored: contact level prior to nursing home placement, dementia status, and resident race. Design and Methods: Interviews were conducted with the significant others of 1,441 residents from a representative sample of nursing homes in Maryland. Results: Contact decreased by approximately half following admission, compared to reported preadmission contact. Rates of contact are positively related to nonuse of Medicaid, kinship closeness, support network proximity, nondemented status, and White race. After controlling for preadmission contact, postadmission contact is positively associated with kinship closeness, support network proximity, nondemented status, and White race. Implications: The study identifies factors that are useful to consider when designing interventions to increase family involvement with nursing home residents. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to describe how assisted living (AL) fits with other long-term-care services.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed the evolution of AL, including the populations served, the services offered, and federal and state policies that create various incentives or disincentives for using AL to replace other forms of care such as nursing home care or home care.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Provider models that have emerged include independent senior housing with services, freestanding AL, nursing home expansion, and continuing care retirement communities. Some integrated health systems have also built AL into their array of services. Federal and state policy rules for financing and programs also shape AL, and states vary in how deliberately they try to create an array of options with specific roles for AL. Among state policies reviewed are reimbursement and rate-setting policies, admission and discharge criteria, and nurse practice policies that permit or prohibit various nursing tasks to be delegated in AL settings. Recent initiatives to increase flexible home care, such as nursing home transition programs, cash and counseling, and money-follows-the-person initiatives may influence the way AL emerges in a particular state.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002There is no single easy answer about the role of AL. To understand the current role and decide how to shape the future of AL, researchers need information systems that track the transitions individuals make during their long-term-care experiences along with information about the case-mix characteristics and service needs of the clientele. Purpose:\\u2002Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and disability levels, this study examines whether differences exist in the structure and function of community-dwelling Black and White frail elders\\' informal care networks.\\u2003Design and Methods: Data from in-person assessments of Michigan\\'s Home and Community-Based Medicaid Waiver applicants were analyzed by using logistic and ordinary least squares regression. The sample consisted of 936 Black and 3,182 White frail elderly persons.\\u2003Results: When sociodemographic characteristics were controlled for, racial differences were found in all informal care components except out-of-home chores. Differences in functional components (amount of care, scope of assistance, and personal care) were largely accounted for by disability, whereas racial differences in the structural components (source of care, living arrangement, and sole caregiver) and in-home chores were not.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Findings suggest that Blacks are not better off than Whites in the receipt of informal care. Although Black elders receive more informal help, this difference is primarily because Blacks are more disabled. This study calls for heightened awareness of disability among low-income Blacks and the potential burden experienced by their caregivers. Retirement is no longer a concern solely for the second half of life. Rather, the idea that we will someday retire is increasingly present to all adults and it is even urged on adolescents. The earliest reaches of adulthood are being colonized by frequent reminders that it takes individual effort to achieve retirement. The changing nature of pensions, the identification of retirement saving with financial markets, the politics of Social Security, the aging baby boom generation, and the interests of a powerful industry and of government are daily compelling people\\'s attention to retirement as a lifelong goal. With retirement as adulthood\\'s great project of deferred gratification, the result could be greater personal readiness to retire but also some ironic outcomes, such as a stronger retirement norm, reluctance to spend on children, and outsized expectations for later life. Purpose: This study sought to determine the prevalence and profile of grandparents providing extensive care for a grandchild (grandparents who provide 30+ hours per week or 90+ nights per year of child care, yet are not the primary caregiver of the grandchild). Design and methods: Secondary analysis of the 3,260 grandparent respondents in the 1992–94 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Extensively caregiving grandparents were compared with custodial grandparents (those with primary responsibility for raising a grandchild for 6+ months), noncaregivers, occasional caregivers (<10 hours per week), and intermediate caregivers using chi-square tests, one-way analysis of variance tests, and logistic regression analyses. Results: Close to 7% of all grandparents provided extensive caregiving, as did 14.9% of those who had provided any grandchild care in the last month. Extensive caregivers most closely resembled custodial caregivers and had least in common with those grandparents who never provided child care. Implications: Areas for future research, policy, and practice are highlighted, including the potential impact of welfare reform legislation on extensively caregiving grandparents. Purpose: Personal assistance care is a Medicaid benefit in New York, but few data are available on its prevalence and contribution to home care. We examined these issues in a New York City sample by assessing older adults\\' reports of weekly home care hours and Medicaid billing records.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002With help from New York City\\'s Human Resources Administration, we identified all respondents in an ongoing population-based survey of Medicare enrollees who were receiving Medicaid-reimbursed personal assistance care in 1996. Results:\\u2002Of respondents in the sample, 10.3% (185 of 1,902 alive through 1996) had Medicaid claims for personal assistance care. The mean was 46.1 hr/week for reported hours and 40.1 hr/week for administrative claims. Accuracy of reported hours was evident in a high correlation (r =.91; p <.001) between respondent reports and authorized claims, and a consistently high and mostly constant ratio of billed to reported hours across all categories of activities of daily living disability.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002In this urban, low income, and mostly minority sample, older adults\\' reports of weekly formal care hours were valid when matched against administrative records. Respondent reports of formal care hours were valid even in complex care situations. Purpose:There is a growing consensus that quality of care for frail elders should include family and be evaluated in terms of patient-centered, family-focused care (PCFFC). Family caregivers are in a unique and sometimes sole position to evaluate such care. In the context of caring for physically frail elders, this study examined the extent to which objective burden was associated with caregiver perceptions of PCFFC and the extent to which it mediated the influence of other variables on perceptions of PCFFC. Design and Methods: In a study of frail elderly veterans receiving care in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ambulatory primary care clinics, informal caregivers assessed quality of care with 13 questions. Factor analysis of these items revealed an eight-item scale that specifically assessed PCFFC (α =.90). Regression analysis identified variables associated with caregiver (N = 210) assessments of PCFFC and the potential mediating effect of objective burden. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Caregiver assessments of PCFFC were positively associated with care recipient instrumental activity of daily living limitations (p =.04) and perspectives on the quality of their own patient care (p <.001). Greater objective burden was negatively associated with caregiver assessments of PCFFC (p <.001) and mediated (i.e., reduced) the relationship between care recipient perceptions of the quality of their own patient care and caregiver assessments of PCFFC (ΔR2 =.06). Implications: These findings support recommendations for conducting caregiver assessments as part of routine care and highlight the importance of measuring objective burden and expectations for PCFFC in assisting physically frail elders. Primary care providers will require additional training in order to effectively implement and translate such caregiver assessments into clinical practice improvement. The study of home environments is a research domain within the field of environmental gerontology that addresses issues related to aging in place. Despite the importance of aging at home, there are few recent studies in this area and most are descriptive and lack theoretical direction. This article examines the current state of research on home environments from which methodological challenges and new directions for future research are identified. Three broad research queries are posed: What should we measure and why in home environments? How do older people and their family members use the home environment in health, illness, and caregiving? What are the interrelationships between the home environment, psychological well-being, and daily functioning throughout the aging process? Suggestions for future research on home environments are discussed and the implications for advancing environmental gerontology highlighted. Specifically, the home environment offers a testing ground for generic environmental constructs and their measurement as well as a unique setting from which new understandings and constructs of person–environment fit can emerge. Purpose:\\u2002Older adults living with HIV infection may be doubly stigmatized, as they are branded by both age as well as HIV status. Through semistructured interviews, this study sought to examine whether older adults with HIV/AIDS experience both ageism and HIV stigma and how those experiences manifest in their lives. Design and Methods: This was a qualitative study in which 25 in-depth interviews were completed with adults aged 50 years and older who were living with HIV or AIDS. Purposive sampling was used to recruit these individuals who shared their experiences. Open coding and axial coding of interview transcripts were completed on all interviews, resulting in the development of a framework of these experiences. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The majority (68%) of the respondents experienced both ageism and HIV-associated stigma. The experiences were often separate, although some interrelated stigma did occur. Nine themes emerged from the interviews, including rejection, stereotyping, fear of contagion, violations of confidentiality, and internalized ageism. All themes fell into four categories: social discrimination, institutional discrimination, anticipatory stigma, and other. Implications: The research identified themes that may be sources of felt as well as enacted stigma and discrimination related to both aging and HIV. This concept of double jeopardy exists in the lives of the majority of people interviewed and has relevance to the creation of appropriate intervention strategies. Purpose.\\u2003The objective of this work was to determine if nursing homes that score differently on prevalence of depression, according to the Minimum Data Set (MDS) quality indicator, also provide different processes of care related to depression.\\u2003Design and Methods.\\u2003A cross-sectional study with 396 long-term residents in 14 skilled nursing facilities was conducted: 10 homes in the lower (25th percentile: low prevalence 0–2%) quartile and 4 homes in the upper (75th percentile: high prevalence 12–14%) quartile on the MDS depression quality indicator. Ten care processes related to depression were defined and operationalized into clinical indicators. Measurement of nursing home staff implementation of each care process and the assessment of depressive symptoms were conducted by trained research staff during 3 consecutive 12-hr days (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.), which included resident interviews (Geriatric Depression Scale), direct observations, and medical record review using standardized protocols.\\u2003Results.\\u2003The prevalence of depressive symptoms according to independent assessments was significantly higher than prevalence based on the MDS quality indicator and comparable between homes reporting low versus high rates of depression (46% and 41%, respectively). Documentation of depressive symptoms was significantly more common in homes reporting a high prevalence rate; however, documentation of symptoms on the MDS did not result in better treatment or management of depression according to any care-process measure. Psychosocial prevention and intervention efforts, such as resident participation in organized social group activities, were not widely used within either group of homes.\\u2003Implications.\\u2003The MDS depression quality indicator underestimates the prevalence of depressive symptoms in all homes but, in particular, among those reporting low or nonexistent rates. The indicator may be more reflective of measurement processes related to detection of symptoms than of prevention, intervention, or management of depression outcomes. A depression quality indicator should not be eliminated from MDS reports because of the importance and prevalence of the condition. However, efforts to improve nursing home staff detection of depressive symptoms should be initiated prior to the use of any MDS-based depression indicator for improvement purposes. Homes that report a low prevalence of depression according to the nationally publicized MDS quality indicator should not be regarded as providing better care. Purpose:\\u2002Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) was a long-term care workforce demonstration that sought to improve recruitment and retention of direct care workers by changing public policy and management practice. The purpose of this article is to document and assess BJBC\\'s implementation, analyze factors affecting implementation, and draw lessons from it for other long-term care workforce initiatives.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed qualitative data from project work plans and progress reports, and notes from telephone and in-person interviews with project staff, coalition stakeholders, and state policy experts. We abstracted the data, categorized it, and summarized it by state in matrices for analysis.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002The five BJBC projects did implement their demonstration plans. Factors that affected project implementation included having demonstration resources; strong, stable leadership; strong coalitions that included key stakeholders; a neutral lead agency; clear goals; effective process; and a favorable state history and context.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002BJBC demonstrated that recruitment and retention is a long-term care industry problem, not just a nursing home problem. Future initiatives should: recognize that workforce policy and management practice change is difficult and takes time, obtain funding, develop strategies specific to the state history and context, engage key stakeholders, and develop relationships among stakeholders. Purpose:\\u2002This article presents a summary of an earlier monograph on the recruitment and retention of older ethnic minority individuals. Design and Methods:\\u2002The authors provide an overview of recruitment and retention efforts made by six National Institutes of Health Office of Minority Research/National Institute on Aging-funded Centers on Minority Aging and Health Promotion. We rely on a model that focuses on barriers and enablers to recruitment that stem from the minority community as well as the research community. Results:\\u2002The summary of findings suggests that recruitment and retention success occurs when there is a match between the goals of the ethnic minority communities and the research community. Implications:\\u2002Recognizing and understanding the culture of each ethnic minority community as well the research perspectives is essential to successful recruitment and retention of ethnic minority elderly individuals. Purpose:\\u2002We adopted a feminist, structural approach to husbands\\' experiences of caring for wives with Alzheimer\\'s disease. This framework posited that men and women draw upon gender repertoires—situational ideals of behavior based upon their respective structural locations—that create gendered experiences of stress and coping strategies.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a qualitative, constructivist approach to analyze in-depth interviews with 22 spousal caregivers and observations within support groups. Our analysis focused on the nine husbands, the strategies these men reported using to deal with problems that arose in their care work, and the extent to which these are congruent with the masculinities of White men in the United States.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We found that these husbands\\' approaches to caregiving and their strategies for dealing with the work and feelings involved were rooted in their sense of selves as men. We outline their overall approaches to caregiving, identify six strategies husbands used to deal with problems stemming from care work—exerting force, focusing on tasks, blocking emotions, minimizing disruption, distracting attention, and self-medicating—and tie these to their structural positions as working-, middle-, and professional-class men.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Theories of gender differences in the performance or quality of care work should tie these to structural arrangements. Unless the gendered bases upon which different styles or experiences are removed (i.e., structural inequality), designers of interventions cannot and should not expect to use the experience of one group to inform appropriate strategies for the other. For several decades, candidates in U.S. presidential election campaigns have articulated policy issues designed to appeal to older Americans. However, exit-poll data have consistently shown that older people have distributed their votes among presidential candidates in roughly the same proportions as the electorate as a whole, favoring the winner of the popular vote. This happened again in 2004. The percentage of older persons voting for George Bush was slightly more than the national average, suggesting that old-age policy issues are not the predominant factors affecting older voters. Purpose.\\u2002Research on home-care outcomes has highlighted the promise of consumer-directed models that rely on recipients rather than agencies to arrange and direct services. However, there has been little research on workers employed directly by recipients. This study examined differences in work-life and worker outcomes between workers in consumer-directed versus agency care as well as between family and nonfamily workers.\\u2003Design and Methods.\\u2002A random sample of 618 workers in the In-Home Supportive Services program in California was selected and interviewed by telephone between September 1996 and March 1997. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, and three Asian languages, with a focus on worker stress and satisfaction.\\u2003Results.\\u2002Findings indicate a mixed portrait of worker experience and outcomes. Most model differences disappear when other variables are controlled, but some worker-stress differences persist between models and types of worker.\\u2003Implications.\\u2002On most dimensions of stress and satisfaction, consumer-directed workers report outcomes equal to or more positive than agency workers. Efforts to improve the work life of home-care workers should acknowledge the strengths of consumer-directed approaches and target all workers across models. Purpose:\\u2002This study describes transitions over 5 years among community-dwelling elderly spouses into and within caregiving roles and associated health outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants in the Caregiver Health Effects Study (n = 818) were interviewed four times over 5 years with changes in their caregiving status described. Analyses of the effect on health outcomes of transitions were performed on those for whom four observations were available (n = 428).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Only half (49.5%) of noncaregivers at baseline remained noncaregivers at 5-year follow-up. The remainder experienced one or more transitions, including moving into the caregiving role, their own or their spouse\\'s death, or placement of their spouse in a long-term care facility. The trajectory of health outcomes associated with caregiving was generally downward. Those who transitioned to heavy caregiving had more symptoms of depression, and poorer self-reported health and health behaviors.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Transitions into and within the caregiving role should be monitored for adverse health effects on the caregiver, with interventions tailored to the individual\\'s location in the caregiving trajectory. Purpose: This preliminary study compared clinical evaluations for guardianship in three states with varying levels of statutory reform. Design and Methods: Case files for 298 cases of adult guardianship were reviewed in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, three states with varying degrees of statutory reform. The quality and content of the written clinical evidence for guardianship and the hearing outcome were recorded. Results: The quality of the written clinical evidence for guardianship was best in Colorado, the state with the most progressive statutory reform, earning a grade of B in our ratings, and worst in Massachusetts, a state with minimal reform, earning a grade of D – with nearly two thirds of the written evidence illegible. Information on specific functional deficits was frequently missing and conclusory statements were common. Information about the individual\\'s key values and preferences was almost never provided, and individuals were rarely present at the hearing. Limited orders were used for 34% of the cases in Colorado, associated with more complete clinical testimony, but such orders were used in only 1 case in either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania. Implications: In this study, states with progressive statutes that promote functional assessment are associated with increased quality of clinical testimony and use of limited orders. A continuing dialogue between clinical and legal professionals is needed to advance reform in guardianship, and thereby provide for the needs and protect the rights of adults who face guardianship proceedings. Purpose: Although remote home assessment would enable specialists to prescribe home modifications for anyone, anywhere, the strategy is dependent on the ability to provide specialists with the same information as an in-home assessment. The purpose of this paper is to document that remote assessment is feasible and concurs largely with traditional in-home assessment based on expert judgment. Design and Methods: We compared two new remote assessments, a “zero-tech” paper-and-pencil protocol and a “high-tech” televideo protocol, to traditional in-home assessments to determine the equivalence of the remote and in-home assessments. We determined equivalence by comparing each of the remote assessments to a traditional in-home assessment in the same home. In-home assessments were conducted by home-modification specialists in all homes. Data collection for the remote protocols was conducted by individuals inexperienced in home modification. Assessment data from the remote protocols were analyzed by specialists to diagnose problems and prescribe solutions. Results: The overall rates of correct problem identification (i.e., Sensitivity + Specificity) were significant (p =.000) for both the remote paper-and-pencil (96.4%) and remote televideo (87.1%) protocols. Similarly, rates of agreement in recommendations of solutions were significant (p =.000) for both remote assessments (78.8% and 77.4%, respectively). Implications: The need for home-modification services, particularly in rural areas, far exceeds the capacity of specialists to provide them. Our findings suggest that remote assessments can potentially be used to identify mobility and safety problems in the home as well as to recommend solutions to those problems. As a result, remote home assessment has the potential to provide underserved elders with access to home-modification services that have heretofore eluded them. Purpose: Little is known about the specific behavioral strategies used by families to manage the physical dependency of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease and related disorders (ADRD). This study reports the psychometric properties of the Task Management Strategy Index (TMSI), a measure designed to identify actions taken by caregivers to simplify everyday self-care tasks for persons with ADRD. Relationships between use of these strategies and caregiver and care-recipient characteristics were also examined. Design and Methods: A pool of 20 items was developed and initially tested with 202 family caregivers (Sample 1) recruited for a dementia-management intervention study. Principal axis factor analysis was performed to determine scale structure. Convergent and discriminant evidence was examined using Pearson cor-relation and multiple regression analyses with a separate sample of 255 family caregivers (Sample 2) recruited for the Philadelphia site of the National Institutes of Health multisite initiative, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\\'s Caregiver Health. Results: Exploratory principal axis factoring yielded one general factor accounting for 60.2% of variance in the first sample. Nineteen items, loading at .3 or above, constituted the final scale (Cronbach\\'s alpha = .81 in Sample 1 and .74 in Sample 2). In Sample 2, TMSI scores were significantly associated with greater functional dependency of ADRD patients, high self-efficacy, and greater use of positive coping strategies. As expected, caregiver upset with disruptive behaviors and caregiver use of criticism-based strategies were not associated with TMSI scores. Higher caregiver education was significantly associated with greater use of task strategies. Implications: Results provide preliminary evidence that the TMSI is an easily administered, reliable, valid scale. Caregivers with lower education may benefit from instruction in the use of these strategies. Purpose: Diagnosis of dementia in its early stages presents a window of opportunity for examining the immediate and long-term consequences of the illness at a point when the individual with memory loss can still participate in decision making.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Memory Club is a 10-session group program designed to provide information about memory loss and resources for coping with it in an emotionally supportive atmosphere for people with dementia and their care partners. Memory Club sessions are structured so that dyads meet together, as well as separately with other care partners and people with dementia, respectively. This approach allows for time for the dyad to talk together about issues in a supportive setting, and for the people in the same role (person with dementia or the care partner) to share experiences with one another.\\u2003Results:\\u2002A preliminary evaluation indicated that people with dementia and their care partners rated Memory Club very positively.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Facing an inevitable decline, persons with early-stage dementia and their care partners found it helpful to talk with one another and with peers in the same circumstances about the disease and its effects. Purpose:\\u2002Previous research from the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Florida suggests that giving consumers control over their personal care greatly increases their satisfaction and improves their outlook on life. Still, some argue that consumer-directed care may not be appropriate for consumers with intellectual disabilities or mental health diagnoses. This study examined how Cash and Counseling—a new option allowing consumers to manage an individualized budget equivalent to what agencies would have spent on their care—changes the way consumers with mental health diagnoses meet their personal care needs and how that affects their well-being.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using the Arkansas CCDE baseline and the 9-month follow-up data for individuals in the treatment and control groups, we compared and contrasted the experience of elderly consumers with and without mental health diagnoses utilizing logit regression.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After examining several outcome measures, including satisfaction with care arrangements and the paid caregiver\\'s reliability and schedule, unmet needs, and satisfaction with the relationship with paid caregivers, this study found evidence that, from the perspective of consumers, the Cash and Counseling program works well for participants with mental health diagnoses.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Considering the growing need for long-term-care services and the limited resources available, a consumer-directed option makes sense, and it can be a valuable alternative for persons with mental health needs. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to determine neuropsychiatric symptom frequency and intensity in demented and cognitively impaired but not demented Latino elderly persons, evaluate whether overall neuropsychiatric symptom intensity is associated with higher levels of caregiver depression, and identify factors that modify the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver depression.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Ninety-five elderly Latinos with dementia or cognitive impairment but not dementia (CIND), all of whom were identified through an ongoing epidemiological cohort study, and their informal caregivers participated in the study. Caregivers were interviewed in their homes, in either Spanish or English. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess neuropsychiatric disturbances.\\u2003Results:\\u2002For most neuropsychiatric symptoms, prevalence and intensity were significantly higher in the demented group compared with the CIND group. The overall neuropsychiatric symptom intensity score was significantly associated with caregiver depression. The strength and direction of the association of neuropsychiatric symptoms with caregiver depression was found to vary by three factors: whether the caregiver was the care recipient\\'s spouse, whether the care recipient had dementia or CIND, and the care recipient\\'s age. Implications: Neuropsychiatric symptoms may play a significant role in caregiver depression among Latino families. However, the impact of neuropsychiatric disturbances on Latino caregivers may differ depending on characteristics of both the caregiver and care recipient. The adverse impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms on caregivers of elderly persons with CIND has not been previously reported and deserves further study. Health trends in the fastest growing sector of the population, the oldest old, have received much attention during the past decade because of the rising costs of medical and long-term care. Many studies have suggested a compression of morbidity in this sector, implying that the future care needs of elderly people will not follow the demographic prognoses. Most of these studies have used health indicators based on disability, a concept that is contextually embedded. We have taken a closer look at health-trend surveys with a focus on the health indicator used. Our findings reveal that although disability measures often show improvement, there is a simultaneous increase in chronic disease and functional impairments—health components that require care resources. That is, an expansion of other health problems may accompany a compression of disability. Therefore, a concept of general morbidity is not sufficient when discussing health trends and the need for care services in the elderly population. Because different indicators do not show the same trends over time, we suggest a more refined discussion that distinguishes between different health components. In addition, different components have different implications for the amount and kind of care resources needed. If the current positive trends in disability continue, future need for social services and long-term care may not parallel demographic projections. Trends in disease and functional limitations seem to have taken a different direction, suggesting a parallel or increased need for resources in medical care, rehabilitation, and compensatory interventions such as assistive technology. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports on a randomized, controlled study of Partners in Caregiving, an intervention designed to increase cooperation and effective communication between family members and nursing home staff.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants included 932 relatives and 655 staff members recruited from 20 nursing homes, randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Parallel training sessions on communication and conflict resolution techniques were conducted with the family and staff in the treatment group, followed by a joint meeting with facility administrators.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Positive outcomes were found for both family and staff members in the treatment group. Both groups showed improved attitudes toward each other, families of residents with dementia reported less conflict with staff, and staff reported a lower likelihood of quitting.\\u2003Implications: Multiple studies report significant interpersonal stress between family members of nursing home residents and facility staff members. Partners in Caregiving appears to be an effective way to improve family–staff relationships in nursing homes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe factors contributing to the decision-making processes of elderly persons as they formulate advance directives in long-term care. Design and Methods: This study was qualitative, based on grounded theory. Recruitment was purposive and continued until saturation was reached. Nine residents of a long-term-care facility were interviewed by use of a semistructured format. Open and axial coding of interview transcripts were carried out and the factors contributing to the decision process were defined. Results: Elders based their decisions primarily on information gathered from personal experiences with death and illness. They obtained very little information from professionals or the media. Major factors considered by elders as they weighed information included spiritual, emotional, and social considerations. Implications: The factors considered during the decision-making process were oriented more toward the individual\\'s experiences and less on contributions from objective sources than anticipated. Decision making for advance directives is a highly personalized process. The approach of health professionals when assisting with end-of-life decision making should be planned with these contributing factors in mind, so that the services offered to the individuals in this population best meet their needs. Purpose: This study examined patients\\' and surrogates\\' attitudes about using advance directives to manage end-of-life medical care. It also explored process preferences, or how patients want decisions to be made. Design and Methods: Data come from the third wave of the Advance Directives, Values Assessment, and Communication Enhancement project, a longitudinal study designed to investigate psychological assumptions underlying the use of advance directives. Three-hundred thirty-seven outpatients aged 65 and older and their designated surrogate decision makers completed interviews and questionnaires. Results: Very few individuals wished to document specific medical treatment preferences and mandate that they be followed, without exception, near death. Most desired to express more general preferences, such as values and goals for care, in addition to (or, instead of) specific treatment preferences and to allow surrogate decision makers leeway in decision making. Patient-to-patient variability with regard to process preferences was substantial, as was surrogates\\' misunderstanding of the patients\\' process preferences. Implications: Very few individuals may desire the standard approach to advance care planning whereby preferences for specific life-sustaining treatments are documented and these requests are strictly followed near death. Instead, patient autonomy may be better served by emphasizing discussion of process preferences and leeway in decision making. This descriptive study examined reports of behavioral problems among older patients hospitalized in acute care medical settings. Greater numbers of behavioral problems were reported by nursing staff on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire than were documented in medical charts over the same time period. Such underreporting may have clinical and administrative implications. Purpose:\\u2002On average, adults aged 60 years or older have 2.2 chronic diseases, contributing to the over 60 million Americans with multiple morbidities. We aimed to understand the financial implications of the most frequent multiple morbidities among older adults.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed Health and Retirement Study data, determining out-of-pocket medical expenses from 1998 and 2002 separately and examining differences in the impact of multiple-morbidity constellations on these expenses. We paid particular attention to the most common disease constellations—hypertension, arthritis, and heart disease.\\u2003Results:\\u2002An increasing prevalence of multiple morbidity (58% compared with 70% of adults had two or more chronic conditions in 1998 and 2002, respectively) was accompanied by escalating out-of-pocket expenditures ($2,164 in 1998, increasing by 104% to $3,748 in 2002). Individuals with two, three, and four chronic conditions had health care expenditure increases of 41%, 85%, and 100%, respectively, over 4 years. Such patterns were particularly noticeable among the oldest old, those with higher educational attainment, and women, although having supplementary health insurance or Medicaid mitigated these expenses. Finally, there were significant differences in out-of-pocket expenditure levels among the multiple-morbidity combinations.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Increasing rates of multiple morbidities in conjunction with escalating health care costs and stable or declining incomes among elders warrant creative attention from providers, researchers, and policy makers. Further understanding how specific multiple-morbidity constellations impact out-of-pocket spending moves us closer to effective interventions to support vulnerable elders. Purpose:\\u2002We examined the effects of facility and market-level characteristics on staffing levels and turnover rates for direct care staff, and we examined the effect of staff turnover on staffing levels. Design and Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1,014 Texas nursing homes. Data were from the 2002 Texas Nursing Facility Medicaid Cost Report and the Area Resource File for 2003. After examining factors associated with staff turnover, we tested the significance and impact of staff turnover on staffing levels for registered nurses (RNs), licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) and certified nursing assistants (CNAs). Results: All three staff types showed strong dependency on resources, such as reimbursement rates and facility payor mix. The ratio of contracted to employed nursing staff as well as RN turnover increased LVN turnover rates. CNA turnover was reduced by higher administrative expenditures and higher CNA wages. Turnover rates significantly reduced staffing levels for RNs and CNAs. LVN staffing levels were not affected by LVN turnover but were influenced by market factors such as availability of LVNs in the county and women in the labor force. Implications: Staffing levels are not always associated with staff turnover. We conclude that staff turnover is a predictor of RN and CNA staffing levels but that LVN staffing levels are associated with market factors rather than turnover. Therefore, it is important to focus on management initiatives that help reduce CNA and RN turnover and ultimately result in higher nurse staffing levels in nursing homes. Purpose:\\u2002The study examined factors associated with state variations in the use of federal and state civil money penalties (CMPs) for nursing homes. Design and Methods: We collected federal and state CMP data from state survey and certification agencies for 2004. We also used federal CMP data from the federal enforcement action database for 2000–2004. Logistic regressions examined factors related to whether states issued CMPs, and ordinary least squares regressions examined the number and amount of federal CMPs (2000–2004) and the total federal and state CMPs (2004).\\u2003Results:\\u2002In 2004, 3,159 federal and state CMPs were collected, for a total of $21.6 million, but CMPs were given for only 2% of deficiencies issued. The number of federal CMPs collected was positively related to average facility occupancy rates, the percentage of facilities with deficiencies for harm or jeopardy, and state survey and certification budgets but was negatively related to the number of facility complaints per nursing home bed. Total federal and state CMPs were positively related to state senators\\' liberal voting records, having a democratic governor, and the percentage of Medicaid nursing home residents and were negatively related to the population aged 65 and older, complaints per nursing home bed, percentage of hospital-based facilities, and home- and community-based expenditures.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should address the state variations in CMPs by providing states and federal regional offices with guidelines on the use of federal CMPs. It should also improve accuracy and completeness by including federal and state CMPs in its enforcement database. Purpose:\\u2002We designed this study to examine the end-of-life (EOL) experience in long-term care (LTC) based on input from key stakeholders.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study consisted of 10 homogeneous focus groups drawn from a purposive sample of LTC residents (2 groups; total n = 11), family caregivers (2 groups; total n = 19), paraprofessional staff (3 groups; total n = 20), and licensed/registered staff (3 groups; total n = 15) from five nursing homes and eight residential care/assisted living communities in North Carolina. We analyzed data by using grounded theory techniques to elicit manifest and latent themes.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Five overarching themes emerged: (a) components of a good death in LTC, (b) normalcy of dying in LTC, (c) the role of relationships in the provision and receipt of care, (d) hospice contributions to care at the EOL in LTC, and (e) stakeholder recommendations for enhancing EOL care in these settings. Underlying these themes was one central category, closeness, based on physical proximity and frequency of contact.\\u2003Implications: Findings suggest that promoting collaborative relationships among the four stakeholder groups, increasing social worker involvement, and removing barriers to hospice may enhance the EOL experience in LTC. Purpose: We explore how nursing home characteristics affect the number of lawsuits filed against the facilities in Florida during the period from 1997 to 2001. Design and Methods: We examined data from 478 nursing homes in 30 Florida counties from 1997 to 2001. We obtained the data from Westlaw\\'s Adverse Filings: Lawsuits database, the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting system database from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state complaint surveys, and we also used primary data. We used negative binomial regression to explain total lawsuit variance by year. We controlled for acuity and year effects, and our explanatory variables included (a) facility characteristics—including staffing, number of beds, multistate system membership, and for-profit ownership—and (b) quality measures—including total number and type of state licensing survey deficiencies, pressure-sore development, and medication errors per resident. Results: Higher registered nurse and certified nursing assistant staffing levels were associated with fewer lawsuits. More deficiencies on the licensing survey and larger and for-profit nursing homes were positively related with higher numbers of lawsuits. Implications: This study suggests that nursing homes that meet long-stay staffing standards, meet minimum quality measures, are not for profit, and are smaller will experience fewer lawsuits. Purpose:\\u2002There is a need for valid and reliable short scales that can be used to assess social networks and social supports and to screen for social isolation in older persons.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The present study is a cross-national and cross-cultural evaluation of the performance of an abbreviated version of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), which was used to screen for social isolation among community-dwelling older adult populations in three European countries. Based on the concept of lack of redundancy of social ties we defined clinical cut-points of the LSNS-6 for identifying persons deemed at risk for social isolation.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Among all three samples, the LSNS-6 and two subscales (Family and Friends) demonstrated high levels of internal consistency, stable factor structures, and high correlations with criterion variables. The proposed clinical cut-points showed good convergent validity, and classified 20% of the respondents in Hamburg, 11% of those in Solothurn (Switzerland), and 15% of those in London as at risk for social isolation.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We conclude that abbreviated scales such as the LSNS-6 should be considered for inclusion in practice protocols of gerontological practitioners. Screening older persons based on the LSNS-6 provides quantitative information on their family and friendship ties, and identifies persons at increased risk for social isolation who might benefit from in-depth assessment and targeted interventions. Purpose: The aims of this study were to assess the factor structure, reliability, and validity of an existing Resident Satisfaction Questionnaire (RSQ) and to develop a short-form RSQ for regular use in residential aged care settings. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted to collect the required information, with facilities being selected using stratified random sampling. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a sample of 1,146 residents in 70 residential aged care facilities in Western Aus-tralia. Results: The RSQ is confirmed to be a reliable, valid, context-relevant, and easy-to-use instrument for assessing residents\\' satisfaction with their residential aged care facilities. Resident satisfaction, as assessed via the RSQ, was found to be a multidimensional construct comprising six factors—Room, Home, Social Interaction, Meals Service, Staff Care, and Involvement. Implications:A 24-item short version of the RSQ can be constructed based on the six-factor resident satisfaction measurement model and used as a regular monitoring tool of resident satisfaction for quality improvement purposes. Purpose:\\u2002This article aims to review research measures and findings related to physical environments of assisted living (AL) according to multiple conceptual perspectives—ecological, cultural, and Maslovian hierarchy.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A literature and research review was undertaken with two foci: performance measures for physical environments, and environmental research findings themselves.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The research review identified a variety of environmental studies with a broad scope of topics, including post-occupancy design multimethod approaches, homeyness, evolution of AL, services, quality of life as an outcome, aging in place, regulatory influences, and environmental design principles. Most studies were descriptive; few dealt with outcomes linked to the environment, and those that did often focused on dementia settings. Some large scale studies with environmental components suggested that physical designs would affect a resident\\'s ability to age in place within an AL setting. Overall, the environmental research was sparse and often characterized by small samples, lack of longitudinal data, or lack of depth.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The field needs research studies that show how resident and environmental characteristics interact to generate both quality-of-life and functioning outcomes, and it also needs work on measures to permit such studies. I suggest eight specific studies in targeted areas and recommend full post-occupancy evaluation studies to develop in-depth understanding about how a setting works for its users. Research on AL environments is most likely to be meaningful if it anchors itself in the study of housing rather than hospitals, nursing homes, and other health settings. Purpose:This review of the literature examines the effectiveness of continuing education programs in long-term care facilities.Design and Methods:A comprehensive literature search was made for evaluation studies and included computerized bibliographic databases, manual searches of journals, the bibliographies of retrieved articles, and information from key informants.Results:Forty-eight studies met our selection criteria. Rigorous research in this area has been limited. Because of the lack of follow-up evaluation, there is minimal evidence that knowledge gained from training programs is sustained in the long term. Most studies do not consider organizational and system factors when planning and implementing training initiatives. This may account for difficulties encountered in the sustained transfer of knowledge to practice.Implications:There is a need for further rigorous research on the effectiveness of continuing education in long-term care, with systematic attention to the role of organizational and system factors. Purpose: This study explored issues surrounding hospitalization rates among rural and urban nursing facility (NF) residents. Design and Methods: Data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS+) collected by states participating in the national Multi-State Case Mix Demonstration were used to assess whether rural NF residents experience higher rates of hospitalization compared with urban residents and to understand the extent that resident, facility, and market/area characteristics contribute to these differences. Results: Rural NF residents were more likely than urban residents to have multiple hospitalizations. Further analysis demonstrated that the effect of rural residence on the probability of multiple hospitalizations is greater among newly admitted rural residents than among rural residents not classified as new admissions. In addition to rural residence, other factors associated with an increased likelihood of multiple hospitalizations included state of residence, diagnosis of congestive heart failure, and no discharge planned at the time of NF admission. Implications: The findings of this study have important implications for both clinical care and health policy related to the financing and administration of NFs. Purpose: This research evaluates the utility of two different definitions of successful aging in predicting well-being. Design and Methods: We assessed the definitions of (a) self-rating and (b) Rowe and Kahn\\'s criteria of absence of disease, disability, and risk factors; maintaining physical and mental functioning; and active engagement with life. We made associations with well-being for each definition using data from 867 Alameda County Study participants aged 65–99 years. Results: The percentage of those rating themselves as aging successfully was 50.3% compared with 18.8% classified according to Rowe and Kahn\\'s criteria. Although absence of chronic conditions and maintaining functioning were positively associated with successful aging for both definitions, many participants with chronic conditions and with functional difficulties still rated themselves as aging successfully; none were so classified according to Rowe and Kahn\\'s criteria. On 14 of 15 measures, self-rated successful aging resulted in sharper contrasts for well-being. Implications: Understanding criteria used by older persons to assess their own successful aging should enhance the conceptualization and measurement of this elusive concept. This study found that the satisfaction of one state\\'s largely older volunteers\\' altruistic, affiliation, and self-improvement motives corresponded to increased organizational loyalty and better performance across several dimensions. Younger volunteers served for shorter periods and were more highly motivated by the “self-improvement” need. Altruism and organizational loyalty emerged as particularly important motivations. Purpose:\\u2002We aimed to develop and evaluate a multimedia workshop curriculum to educate physicians and other health professionals about (a) driving-related assessment in older adults with dementia, and (b) strategies to encourage driving retirement for impaired individuals.Design and Methods:\\u2002A curriculum developed by the Older Drivers Project of the American Medical Association was expanded for presentation by a multidisciplinary team. One pilot and seven test workshops were offered. A program evaluation method—testing knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and practice behaviors—was employed at four points in time: T1 (Time 1; pretest focusing on the previous 12 months), T2 (Time 2; same-day post-test), T3 (Time 3; post-test at 3 months), and T4 (Time 4; post-test at 12 months).\\u2003Results:\\u2002At T1, participants (N = 147) expressed high agreement that an assessment of driving ability is an important issue in clinical dementia care, but they reported low knowledge of assessment strategies, resources, and state reporting requirements. Modest gains in knowledge and confidence were demonstrated at both T3 (n = 93) and T4 (n = 63). In addition, the frequency of driving-related practice behaviors (i.e., incorporation of driving-related questions into clinical evaluation, chart documentation, reporting of impaired drivers) had increased significantly by T3 and T4.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results indicate that a focused workshop curriculum, with practical and immediate applications to care, can motivate measurable changes in clinical practice. Once they are informed, health professionals can address issues of driving ability in older patients with dementia and, with the support of available resources, encourage impaired individuals to retire from driving for the safety of everyone on the road. The nursing home problem in Florida was characterized as a debate over quality of care and the rapid increase of lawsuits against nursing homes that led to a decline in the availability of affordable liability insurance. The staff for Florida\\'s Task Force on Availability and Affordability of Long-Term Care analyzed lawsuit and quality-of-care data from one county in Florida and quality-of-care data statewide to understand the relationship between the two sides of the argument. Analyses showed support for both positions and a middle-ground policy position was achieved. The subsequent nursing home reform legislation and implications for the future of long-term care in Florida are discussed. Purpose:\\u2002This study describes the development of a short version of the Expectations Regarding Aging Survey (ERA-38), a 38-item survey measuring expectations regarding aging. Design and Methods:\\u2002In 1999, surveys containing the ERA-38 were mailed to 588 adults aged ≥ 65 years who were recruited through physicians; 429 individuals (73%) returned completed surveys. The mean age of participants was 77 years; 76% were White. In 2001, we surveyed 643 adults aged ≥ 65 years recruited at 14 senior centers. The mean age of participants was 78 years; 37% were Latino and 16% were African American. With the 1999 data, we selected items for the shorter version of the ERA-38 by using qualitative criteria and by evaluating the items\\' factor structure, internal consistency reliability of scales, and correlations with age and self-reported measures of health. Then, using the 2001 data, we evaluated the selected items with confirmatory factor analysis, and we reevaluated the internal consistency reliability and associations of the scales with age and self-reported measures of health. Results:\\u2002The factor analyses of the ERA-12 on both samples provided support for three 4-item scales (expectations regarding physical health, expectations regarding mental health, and expectations regarding cognitive function), and one global expectations regarding aging scale combining all 12 items. In both samples, internal consistency reliability estimates for all scales exceeded 0.74, and the 12 items together explained over 88% of the variance in the ERA-38 total score. We found comparable associations of the ERA-12 scales with age and self-reported health measures in both samples. Implications: The ERA-12 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity to estimate expectations regarding aging. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between medical, functional, economic, oral health, social, religious, and psychological factors and under-eating in homebound older adults. The focus of the study was on identifying potentially modifiable factors amenable to social and behavioral interventions.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A total of 230 homebound older adults who were currently receiving home health services participated in interviews in their homes using a questionnaire to assess eating behaviors and factors that could possibly affect those eating behaviors. Interviewers measured height and weight, and participants completed three 24-hr dietary recalls.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The mean age of participants was 79.1 years. The sample comprised 78% women and 38% African Americans. We found that 70% of participants were under-eating, defined as not consuming enough calories to maintain their current body weight. Participants who were at higher risk of under-eating included men, those receiving either infrequent care or very frequent care by a caregiver, those who had been hospitalized prior to receipt of home health services, and those with a higher body mass index.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Findings from the study have implications for both practice and policy. Experts must develop evidence-based interventions targeted at under-eating in this particularly vulnerable and growing population of homebound older adults. This study provides an initial foundation for the development of targeted evidence-based behavioral nutritional interventions that are noninvasive and cost effective. Purpose:\\u2002To promote health and maintain independence, Just for Us provides financially sustainable, in-home, integrated care to medically fragile, low-income seniors and disabled adults living in subsidized housing. Design and Methods:\\u2002The program provides primary care, care management, and mental health services delivered in patient\\'s homes by a multidisciplinary, multiagency team.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After 2 years of operation, Just for Us is serving nearly 300 individuals in 10 buildings. The program is demonstrating improvement in individual indices of health. Medicaid expenditures for enrollees are shifting from ambulances and hospital services to pharmacy, personal care, and outpatient visits. The program is not breaking even, but it is moving toward that goal. The program\\'s success is based on a partnership involving an academic medical center, a community health center, county social and mental health agencies, and a city housing authority to coordinate and leverage services.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Just for Us is becoming a financially sustainable way of creating a “system within a nonsystem” for low-income elderly persons in clustered housing. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine group differences in verbal agitation, verbal interaction, bed restraint, pain, analgesic and neuroleptic medication use, and medical comorbidity among agitated nursing home residents who died during a 6-month clinical trial compared with residents of the same gender and similar initial cognitive status who did not die during the trial. Design and Methods: We conducted a two-group secondary data analysis of prospective observational data from 10 nursing homes in Birmingham, Alabama. By means of chart review, resident assessments, surveys of certified nursing assistants, and direct observation of residents\\' daily behaviors and environment, 32 residents (87.34 ± 7.29 years) with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score = 4.31 (±5.54) who died were compared with 32 residents (84 ± 6.96 years) with a mean MMSE score = 4.28 (±5.49) who did not die during the clinical trial. Results: Residents who died displayed more verbal agitation, less time in verbal interaction with staff, and almost twice as much time restrained in bed during observation time in comparison with residents who did not die during the clinical trial. However, groups did not differ significantly in severity of comorbid illness, functional status, number of painful diagnoses, certified nursing assistants\\' reports of residents\\' pain, or opioid or nonopioid analgesic prescription or dosage. Surviving residents were more likely to receive neuroleptic medication than residents who died. Implications: Results suggest that agitated nursing home residents may exhibit a heightened level of verbal agitation, decreased verbal interaction with staff, and increased bed restraint up to 3 months prior to death. Prospective observational studies are needed to identify markers for imminent mortality among nursing home residents. Purpose:Using a conceptual framework from the field of care work and the theory of boundary work, we explore the use of family metaphors by nurse\\'s aides to describe their affective care for nursing home residents. We focus on how nurse\\'s aides can express affective care in spite of experiencing racial abuse.Methods:\\u2002Using the technique of domain analysis, we present a secondary analysis of semistructured interviews with 30 African American and immigrant aides working in three nursing homes about their experience of racism on the job.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Aides used metaphors associated with family, relationships, and attachment to describe their affective care of residents. They expressed the value of their caring by contrasting it with “uncaring” families. Immigrant aides expressed a form of caring culture shock about the uncared-for situation of American elders.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Through their use of metaphors of family and attachment, these aides define family care as their gold standard of affective care and communicate that they are attempting to provide good care. Aides distinguished caring tasks from affective care in that they applied affective care in an elective way, so that the caring task was the minimum, universal form of care and added affective care created an enriched form of care. They held out informal elder care in their cultures of origin as a model that is superior to the system of formal elder care in which they work. We use the theory of boundary work to explain how these aides provided affective care in the face of racial abuse. Purpose: This article investigates how older Americans leave their career jobs and estimates the extent of intermediate labor force activity (bridge jobs) between full-time work on a career job and complete labor-force withdrawal. Design and Methods: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we explored the work histories and retirement patterns of a cohort of retirees aged 51 to 61 in 1992 during a 10-year period in both cross-sectional and longitudinal contexts. We examined determinants of retirement patterns in a multinomial logistic regression model. Results: We found that a majority of older Americans with career jobs retire gradually, in stages, rather than all at once. We also found that the utilization of bridge jobs was more common among younger respondents, respondents without defined-benefit pension plans, and respondents at both the lower and upper ends of the wage distribution. Implications: Older Americans are now working longer than pre-1980s trends would have predicted. Given concerns about the traditional sources of retirement income (Social Security, employer pensions, and prior savings), older Americans may have to rely more on earnings. This article suggests that many are already doing so by moving to bridge jobs after leaving their career employment. Purpose: The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) has been validated in many diverse samples. This measure of health-related quality of life, however, has not yet been examined among older Mexican Americans, a rapidly growing subset of the older population. Design and Methods: We address the validity of the SF-36 in a sample of older Mexican Americans (N = 621) selected from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly. Using confirmatory factor analysis through structural equation modeling, we evaluate the construct validity of this scale. Results: The results indicate evidence for a model with eight first-order factors consistent with previous research on the SF-36 and two second-order factors representing mental and physical health. Implications: This, in addition to other evidence given here, leads us to the conclusion that the SF-36 is a valid measure of health-related quality of life in this sample of older Mexican Americans. Purpose:\\u2002There is a dearth of research on older adoptive parents caring for minor children, despite a growing number of such adoptions finalized each year. This study offers a large-scale investigation of adoptive families headed by older parents. We describe these families and explore how preadoptive kinship between the adoptive parent and the child impacts adoption outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyze data from kin (n = 98) and nonkin (n = 310) adoptive families headed by adults aged 60 years and older.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We find that older kin adoptive families are smaller, report lower income, and include adoptive mothers with less formal education. Children in these families had less severe needs for special care at the time of placement. Although kin and nonkin older parents offer similar assessments of their parent–child relationships, kin adopters indicate a greater willingness to adopt the same child again and yet report less positive current family functioning. Multivariate regression analyses reveal that preadoptive kinship predicts more negative parental assessment of the adoption\\'s impact on the family and less positive family functioning net of other parent, family, and child characteristics. Externalizing behavior by the child (e.g., delinquency or aggression) is the strongest predictor of deleterious outcomes for both groups.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Kin adoption by older adults creates new families under strain but does not reduce parental commitment to the child. We conclude that older adults serve as effective adoptive parents but would benefit from preadoption and postadoption services to assist them in preparing for and positively addressing the challenging behaviors exhibited by adopted children. Purpose:\\u2002We examined whether written emotional disclosure reduces stress and improves health outcomes for family caregivers of physically frail and cognitively impaired older adults, as it has been shown to do for certain student and clinical populations.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Primary caregivers of older adults attending a day program were randomly assigned to expressive-writing (n = 14), time-management (n = 13), or history-writing (n = 13) conditions. Participants wrote for 20 minutes on four occasions over a 2-week period, and they completed self-report measures of caregiver burden and health prior to the intervention, immediately afterward, and at 1-month follow-up.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Contrary to expectations, expressive-writing and history-writing participants performed similarly across outcomes. Only caregiver participants in the time-management condition experienced significant mental and physical health improvements after writing.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results of this study add to a growing body of research demonstrating equivocal effects of expressive writing with clinical samples, and they suggest the potential benefit of written time management for stressed caregivers. Purpose: There are few empirical studies relating components of long-term care to quality of life for residents with dementia. This study relates elements of dementia care in residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities and nursing homes to resident quality of life and considers the guidance this information provides for practice and policy. Design and Methods: We used a variety of report and observational measures of the structure and process of care and 11 standardized measures of quality of life to evaluate the care for and quality of life of 421 residents with dementia in 35 RC/AL facilities and 10 nursing homes in four states. Data were collected cross sectionally on-site, and we conducted a 6-month follow-up by telephone. Results: Change in quality of life was better in facilities that used a specialized worker approach, trained more staff in more domains central to dementia care, and encouraged activity participation. Residents perceived their quality of life as better when staff was more involved in care planning and when staff attitudes were more favorable. Better resident–staff communication was related to higher quality of life as observed and reported by care providers. Also, more stable resident–staff assignment was related to care providers\\' lower quality-of-life ratings. Implications: Improvement in resident quality of life may be achieved by improved training and deployment of staff. Purpose:\\u2002This study developed and tested two 24-month primary care interventions to alleviate the psychological distress suffered by the caregivers of those with Alzheimer\\'s disease. The interventions, using targeted educational materials, were patient behavior management only, and patient behavior management plus caregiver stress–coping management. We hypothesized that the addition of the stress–coping component would improve caregiver outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A randomized clinical trial of 167 caregiver–care recipient dyads was run, of whom 76 completed the study without bereavement or placement.\\u2003Results:\\u2002During 24 months, caregivers who received the patient behavior management component only, compared with those who also received the stress–coping component, had significantly worse outcomes for general well-being and a trend toward increased risk of depression (i.e., a score of >16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale). There was a studywide improvement for bother associated with care recipient behaviors (according to the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Our data suggest that brief primary care interventions may be effective in reducing caregiver distress and burden in the long-term management of the dementia patient. They further suggest that interventions that focus only on care recipient behavior, without addressing caregiving issues, may not be as adequate for reducing caregiver distress. Purpose:\\u2002In this study we evaluate outcomes of a community-based program to prevent suicide among elderly individuals aged 65 and older.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a quasi-experimental design with intervention and referent municipalities. The program included a 7-year implementation of depression screening with follow-up by general practitioners and a 10-year implementation of public education conducted in Yasuzuka (population 4,940; elderly suicide rate for women, 275/100,000; for men, 323/100,000). We estimated changes in the risk of completing suicide before and after the 10-year implementation by the incidence-rate ratio (IRR).Results:\\u2002The risk for women in the intervention area was reduced by 64% (age-adjusted IRR = 0.36; 95% confidence interval = 0.14–0.93), whereas there was no significant change in the risk for men in the intervention area and either men or women in the referent municipalities. A ratio of the IRR for women aged 65 to 74 in the intervention area to that in its prefecture was estimated at 0.23 (90% confidence interval = 0.05–0.99), showing that the risk reduction was greater than the secular trend.\\u2003Implications:The management of depression by use of community resources involving public health and primary care physicians is effective in the prevention of suicide for elderly women but uncertain for men. Medical autopsy rates have been declining for the past several decades, yet, for more than a decade, the University of Kentucky Alzheimer\\'s Disease Research Center has been recruiting healthy older adults into a program involving annual assessments of mental status, biannual medical and neurological exams, and prearranged postmortem brain examination. The present article focuses on the characteristics of these donors to explore potential factors that contribute to the decision to donate. The motivations of this unique group of individuals could serve to inform physicians who request autopsies for medical and research purposes. Over 500 volunteers who have enrolled in this program are well-educated community-dwelling adults over the age of 60. They are generally motivated by personal experiences with Alzheimer\\'s disease, referral by someone already enrolled, and a desire to promote scientific knowledge. These volunteers\\' reasons suggest that rates of tissue donation or autopsy for basic research and investigations of causes of death might be increased by providing individuals and families with information concerning the medical and scientific value of the procedure. Within research settings, encouraging participant recruitment of friends or family members would likely increase tissue acquisition rates. We describe national trends during the 1990s in late-life difficulty and assistance with self-care activities. Among older Americans living in the community and experiencing difficulty with self-care activities, assistive-technology use increased substantially whereas use of personal care declined. Using a decomposition technique, we demonstrate that these shifts in assistance toward technology account for half the decline in the number of people dependent on personal care. Purpose:\\u2002The purposes of the study are to provide a phenomenological description of the pre- and post-retirement experience and to examine adjustment during the two periods.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This is a longitudinal study of 56 Israeli men that employs both personal interviews and standard measures of physical and mental health.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The pre-retirement interviews show four main perceptions. The dominant perception was as a period of uncertainty and crisis. The others were as providing hope for change, as a continuation of their lives until then, and as a developmental transition. Interviews 1 year post-retirement show that most of the men were happily occupied. Comparison of pre- and post-retirement scores on standardized tests shows reduced distress. Implications:\\u2002The findings point to the desirability of supportive pre-retirement interventions that would emphasize working out emotional difficulties posed the anticipation of ending work. Purpose: This study was undertaken to examine the resources, staffing, and performance of the state survey agencies that have primary responsibility for regulating nursing facilities—licensing them at a state level and certifying them for participation in Medicare and Medicaid on behalf of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; formerly the Health Care Financing Administration). Design and Methods: A telephone and fax survey of survey agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia was used, supplemented by secondary data collected from CMS\\'s On-Line Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) system. Results: Total state agency expenditures on nursing facility regulation in 2000 were $382.2 million, which is less than one half of 1% of the total expenditures on nursing facilities in the United States. About 3,000 full-time equivalent surveyors are employed to regulate more than 17,000 nursing facilities in the United States. Nursing facility licensing and certification dominates the work of state survey agencies, although they are responsible for regulating many other health care organizations. Spending has risen recently, but resource levels vary greatly across states, and most state agencies report significant funding shortfalls that impact on their ability to perform their regulatory function. On a range of indicators, the performance of state survey agencies varies fivefold. Some of that state variation is explained by differences in resource levels for regulation, but most is not. Implications: State survey agencies probably need more funding to fulfill their responsibilities properly, but other changes are also needed to improve their performance, including more support and oversight by CMS and more effective regulatory design. Purpose: Many older patients with common chronic conditions also experience chronic pain. We examined how chronic pain affects patients\\' difficulty with recommended self-management activities and the potential intervening role of self-efficacy (the level of confidence in one\\'s own ability to perform a specific task). Design and Methods: We obtained data from a cross-sectional nationwide survey of older patients, primarily older men, with chronic health conditions (N = 543). We defined chronic pain as pain present most of the time for 6 months or more during the past year. We assessed ability to follow self-management recommendations by asking respondents to rate their level of difficulty in performing three commonly recommended activities as suggested by their doctor. Results: More than 60% of survey respondents reported chronic pain. Chronic pain was significantly associated with difficulty exercising regularly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–2.37) and taking prescribed medications (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.10–8.59) but not with following a recommended eating plan (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.76–1.76). However, when we took self-efficacy into account, chronic pain was no longer significantly associated with either exercise or taking medications. Implications: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition among older patients and is associated with greater reported difficulty performing certain essential self-management activities. Self-efficacy, however, plays an important intervening role. Specifically, higher self-efficacy negated or reduced the association between chronic pain and reported difficulty exercising and taking medications. Promoting self-efficacy among older adults with multiple chronic health problems is a promising strategy to improve their ability to follow self-management recommendations. Purpose: The present study examined the relationships between the frequency and functions of reminiscence, personality styles, and psychological functioning. There is little research on the psychological factors that correlate with reminiscence, especially in relationship to clinical constructs such as depression and anxiety. Research in the area of reminiscence functions may facilitate a better understanding of the factors affecting change in reminiscence therapies. Design and Methods: Seventy-seven healthy older adults completed the following self-report scales: Reminiscence Functions Scale, NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory—Second Edition, State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Templer-McMordie Death Anxiety Scale. Results:Using canonical correlation techniques, results indicated that individuals with negative psychological functioning frequently reminisce as a way to refresh bitter memories, reduce boredom, and prepare for death. Implications: The present study provides implications for both researchers and clinicians. Contrary to previous studies, results indicate that depressed and anxious older adults commonly use reminiscence and therefore may be appropriate candidates for reminiscence treatments. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between nursing home staffing level, care received by individual residents, and resident quality-related care processes and functional outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Nurses recorded resident care time for 5,314 residents on 156 units in 105 facilities in four states (Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, and Mississippi). We linked residents\\' care times to their measures of health and functioning from Minimum Data Set assessments. Major variables were unit- and resident-specific minutes of care per day, process measures (physical restraints, range of motion, toileting program, and training in activities of daily living [ADLs]), outcome measures (ADL decline, mobility decline, and worsening behavior between the time study and 90-day follow-up), and covariates such as unit type and resident health status. We used multilevel analysis to examine staffing and quality relationships. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Residents with toileting programs, range of motion or ADL training, and restraints received significantly more care from unlicensed but not from licensed staff. However, functional outcomes were not significantly related to care received from licensed or unlicensed staff, except for ADL decline, which was greatest for residents receiving more unlicensed minutes of care. Unit staffing level (licensed and unlicensed) was unrelated to any of the care processes or outcome measures, although higher overall staffing was associated with more time devoted to direct resident care.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Future research into nursing home quality should focus on organization and delivery rather than simply the amount of care available. Purpose: A collaborative partnership model was used to develop and implement a state-wide community education program on universal design.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002University faculty, extension professionals, older adult service agencies, service learning students, and a community retail chain made up the original partnership.\\u2003Results:\\u2002This collaboration resulted in a five-stage partnership model. The model was used to develop and disseminate a consumer education program to promote aging in place. The five stages include (a) identifying partner strengths and shared learning, (b) program development, (c) implementing the universal design program, (d) facilitating collaborative outreach, and (e) shifting toward sustainable outreach.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A lack of knowledge exists among consumers, builders, and health care professionals regarding strategies for aging in place. Collaborations between educators, outreach professionals, students, and a retail partner resulted in increased interest and awareness about universal design changes that enable seniors to age in place. Purpose:\\u2002This study systematically reviews approaches that national surveys have used to measure the use of assistive devices and examines the implications of these different approaches for prevalence estimates of device use and disability in late life. Design and Methods: Cross-sectional data from six national surveys are used to compare rates of assistive device use and disability among community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older. Results: Estimates of the use of any device are similar across surveys, ranging from 14% to 18% for the population of adults aged 65 and older. However, one survey design element—the restriction of device-use questions to those reporting difficulty with daily activities—omits a potentially sizeable group: those who use devices but report no difficulty. Including this group of device users significantly increases the prevalence estimates of both device use and disability. Implications: The use of assistance and perceptions of difficulty are inextricably interwoven, and attention to the measurement of these concepts is needed. Survey designers may want to consider asking questions about assistive device use independent of questions about difficulty. In addition, researchers who study disability may want to consider including those who report using devices but no difficulty, a group that may become more prevalent as new cohorts age. Purpose:\\u2002Agitation frequently accompanies cognitive decline among nursing home residents. This study used cross-sectional and longitudinal (up to 18 months) methods to examine agitation among profoundly and moderately impaired residents using both staff report and direct observation methods.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study included participants (N = 78) from a larger study who completed either 12 or 18 months of data collection. There were four measurement points, each separated by 6-month intervals. We recorded agitation using two measures: (a) the computer-assisted behavioral observation system (CABOS) and (b) the staff-completed Nursing Home Behavior Problem Scale. We used longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling to capture the dynamic nature of behavior change as a function of individual resident characteristics and time. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The profoundly cognitively impaired residents (M Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score = 1.7) displayed more agitation than the moderately impaired group (M MMSE score = 15.4) at Epoch 1 (cross-sectional analyses). Longitudinal analysis found a significant linear and quadratic trend only with the profoundly impaired residents using the CABOS. These residents showed slight improvements in agitation up to 12 months, with agitation increasing significantly from 12 to 18 months.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002With nursing homes receiving an increasing number of profoundly cognitively impaired residents, these results have potential cost and policy implications. Measuring agitation over time by using both staff report and observation measures presents various problems, and we present an alternative measure that may help to avoid these difficulties. Purpose:\\u2002Research underscores how autonomy and decision-making involvement may help to enhance the quality of life of older adults; however, individuals with dementia are often excluded from decision making that is related to their daily functioning. In this study we use a modified version of the Stress Process Model to consider the stress process of individuals with chronic illness, and in particular to explore the predictors of decision-making involvement among individuals with dementia (n = 215).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We collected data from individual with dementia (IWD)–family caregiver dyads. Relying primarily on data from the IWD, we used hierarchical multiple regression analysis to determine the predictors of the IWD\\'s decision-making involvement.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results indicate that individuals who report more decision-making involvement are younger, female, have more education, have a nonspousal caregiver, have fewer months since their diagnosis, exhibit fewer problems with activities of daily living and fewer depressive symptoms (based on caregiver report), and place more importance on autonomy/self-identity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002In our discussion we examine the importance of autonomy and impairment levels for understanding the decision-making involvement of persons with dementia. Purpose: This study explores the development and testing of an instrument to measure long-term-care planning behavior. Design and Methods: Researchers operationalized proposed constructs and response styles as statements in a questionnaire. A telephone survey involved 150 randomly selected residents of Miami–Dade County, Florida who were between the ages of 55 and 70. Responses underwent exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and reliability testing. Results: The trimmed long-term-care planning instrument of 23 items had five subscales with high internal reliability (coefficients >.70), a comparative fit index of.987, and a root mean square error of approximation of.050. Responses involved making choices about housing, readiness to use help from family and friends, maintaining one\\'s health, saving and investing money, and not accepting the need to ask for help. Implications: Future research of long-term-care planning behaviors can use the instrument. Practitioners may use the instrument as a diagnostic inventory, alone or in combination with personalized educational interventions aimed at increasing awareness of and planning for future dependency and long-term-care assistance. Purpose:Family caregivers comprise the backbone of long-term-care provision in the United States, yet little is known about how the composition and experience of family caregiving has changed over time. Design and Methods:Data are drawn from the 1989 and 1999 National Long-Term Care Survey and Informal Caregiver Survey to develop nationally representative profiles of disabled older adults and their primary informal caregivers at two points in time. Results:The proportion of chronically disabled community-dwelling older adults who were receiving informal assistance from family or friends declined over the period of interest, whereas the proportion receiving no human help increased. On average, recipients of informal care were older and more disabled in 1999 than in 1989. Primary caregivers were children (41.3%), spouses (38.4%), and other family or friends (20.4%); children were more likely and others less likely to serve as primary caregivers in 1999 relative to 1989. Primary caregivers provided frequent and high levels of help at both points in time. A striking increase was found (from 34.9% to 52.8%) in the proportion of primary caregivers working alone, without secondary caregiver involvement. Implications:In the context of projected demographic trends and budgetary constraints to public health insurance programs, these data underscore the importance of identifying viable strategies to monitor and support family caregivers in the coming years. Purpose: This study aimed to develop home care quality indicators (HCQIs) to be used by a variety of audiences including consumers, agencies, regulators, and policy makers to support evidence-based decision making related to the quality of home care services. Design and Methods: Data from 3,041 Canadian and 11,252 U.S. home care clients assessed with the Minimum Data Set—Home Care (MDS-HC) were used to evaluate a series of indicators suggested by international experts and by focus groups conducted in Canada and the United States. Risk adjustment methods were derived and validated using data from Ontario and Michigan. Results: Of the 73 original candidate HCQIs, 22 were retained for the final list of recommended indicators. All but three indicators include risk adjusters based on individual-level covariates. An agency-level risk adjustment was developed to correct for selection and ascertainment bias. Implications: The HCQIs are new tools providing a first step along the path of quality improvement for home care. These indicators can provide high-quality evidence on performance at the agency level and on a regional basis. Purpose: This study assessed the extent to which community-dwelling rural older adults mismanage their prescription medication regimens and predicted mismanagement of medications from selected socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile char-acteristics. Design and Methods: Personal interviews with 499 community-dwelling adults aged 66 and over taking at least one prescription medication and living in a rural region of the Southeast. With approximately equal numbers of African American and white men and women, the SUDAAN multiple logistic regression procedure was used to predict the mismanagement of prescription medications. Results: The mismanagement of prescribed medication regimens is relatively common among older adults. Those more likely than others to mismanage their regimens are African American, younger, in poorer mental health, with more acute care physician visits, and those who find payment for their medications to be problematic. Implications: The implications of the findings for what is known about the self-modification of drug regimens, targeting prescription drug cost benefits or interventions, and the limitations of the study are discussed. Purpose: This exploratory study used a set of four obstacle constructs derived from both the existing literature and our earlier work to describe the diverse end-of-life scenarios observed for a group of residents in a long-term care facility. Design and Methods: Data from a retrospective chart review and both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were used to examine in-depth the end-of-life experiences of all nursing home residents (N = 41) who died on the nursing care unit of a large continuing care retirement community during an 18-month period. Results: A hierarchy of obstacles to palliation and end-of-life care seems to exist in long-term care settings that begins with the lack of recognition that restorative, rehabilitative, or curative treatment futility has commenced. The next three obstacles in sequence include lack of communication among decision makers, no agreement on a course of care, and failure to implement a timely plan of care. Implications: The findings highlight the importance of determining treatment futility as an initial step in the successful delivery of palliative and end-of-life care to residents in long-term care followed by the need for a deliberate and proactive series of actions and care planning processes. Purpose:\\u2002Healthy IDEAS (HIDEAS; IDEAS stands for Identifying Depression, Empowering Activities for Seniors) is an evidence-based depression program addressing commonly recognized barriers to mental health care for older adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the implementation of HIDEAS and assess its feasibility.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Three community agencies implemented the program with 94 eligible older adults who were identified from 348 screened older adults. We assessed program implementation by using the Core Implementation Component framework, using a client-tracking database, written survey of case managers, focus-group interview with coaches, and agency and project progress reports.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We identified several challenges: clients\\' reluctance to acknowledge depressive symptoms and difficulty in engaging in behavioral changes; differences among case managers\\' mental health knowledge, skills, and “buy-in” and difficulty managing limited time; and differences in agency culture that foster in-agency supervision.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Successful adoption and sustainability of HIDEAS are more likely when essential elements of the Core Implementation Component framework are addressed to bring about behavioral changes at all treatment-implementation levels—clients, practitioners, and organizations. Purpose: This study examined the effects of an early interventive social service program on the subjective well-being, permanent institutionalization, and mortality risk of low-income community-dwelling elders. Design and Methods: From a waiting list for community-based services, 105 \"moderately at-risk\" community-dwelling elders were recruited. Forty of these persons were randomly assigned to receive the intervention, and the remainder did not receive the intervention. Participants were interviewed every 3 months for 18 months. Primary outcome measures were depression, satisfaction with social relationships, environmental mastery, life satisfaction, permanent institutionalization, and mortality. Results: No significant differences in sociodemographic or health characteristics were found between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Those elders who received the intervention had significantly higher subjective well-being and were less likely to be institutionalized or die than those in the comparison group across the 18-month period. Implications: The results make a strong case for the importance of community-based programs to the well-being of elders. Practitioners and policy makers should continue the search for community-based programs that are cost-effective and improve the quality of life for elders. Purpose: This study sought to determine the effects of nursing home placement (NHP) for patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease, compared to maintaining community placement, on changes in family caregiver health and well-being over time. Design and Methods: We utilized a 2-year, longitudinal study with one baseline and four follow-up assessments for patients\\' spouses, adult offspring, and in-laws (married to offspring). Families were recruited from eight clinical outpatient centers, supported by the State of California, and followed in the community over time. A multidisciplinary clinical evaluation was undertaken by the centers, and follow-up assessments included questionnaire and interview data. Results: Family caregiver health and well-being did not improve over time following NHP, and there were no significant differences in health and well-being between family caregivers who placed their ill elder in a nursing home and those who kept the elder at home or in the community. However, female family caregivers and spouses displayed greater declines in health and well-being over time, compared to other family caregivers, regardless of whether or not NHP occurred. Implications: Families considering NHP need to be advised of what may and may not change following NHP. In particular, spouses and female family caregivers may not experience those changes in life satisfaction and well-being that are hoped for. Variation in the effects of NHP may be more related to pre-NHP family processes and relationships than to the severity of the patient\\'s disability, caregiver strain, patient and caregiver demographics, and use of community-based professional services. Purpose:\\u2002Data from incident-reporting systems have been used successfully in disciplines other than health care to improve safety. This study tested the effect of a falls menu-driven incident-reporting system (MDIRS) on quality-improvement efforts in nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Following instrument development and testing, the intervention occurred over a 4-month period in three intervention nursing homes using the MDIRS matched with three homes using their existing narrative incident report to document falls. Data on fall incidents were collected from facility incident reports, and comparisons in incident-report documentation were made between the intervention and control groups. The minutes from quality-improvement meetings were examined to see how incident-report data were used for fall-prevention strategies.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Almost one third of nursing home residents among the six facilities fell during the 4-month study period. Intervention nursing homes had significantly better documentation of fall characteristics on the incident reports than did the control nursing homes. Although only one nursing home fully implemented the MDIRS intervention, all three facilities identified strengths of the system.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The MDIRS can have a significant impact in improving how nursing staff assess residents following a fall incident. Traditional narrative methods of documenting adverse incidents are time consuming and may not yield sufficient and accurate data. This model has the potential to enhance quality-improvement efforts and augment the current system of adverse incident reporting in nursing homes. Purpose: This research reviewed studies that compare two or more racial, ethnic, national, or cultural groups on aspects of the dementia caregiving experience. Design and Methods: Electronic databases were searched to find studies published between 1996 and 2000 in peer-reviewed journals that met the above criteria. Results: Twenty-one studies based on 18 samples were identified. These articles included comparisons involving the following groups of caregivers: African Americans, Chinese, Chinese Americans, Koreans, Korean Americans, Latinos, Whites, and residents of 14 European Union countries. Consistent with previous research, White caregivers were more likely to be spouses when compared to other groups. White caregivers tended to report greater depression and appraised caregiving as more stressful than African American caregivers. Findings were mixed regarding differences in coping and social support, but suggested that minority groups may not have more available support than Whites. Common methodological limitations were a lack of noncaregiving control groups and failure to test specific pathways by which the grouping variable (e.g., race) exerts its impact on outcome variables. Implications: Future studies in this area should use both quantitative and qualitative research methods to specify the pathways by which race, ethnicity, and culture affect the caregiving experience, and should expand their focus beyond the primary caregiver to include the effects of caregiving on families and networks. Purpose:\\u2002This research provides state policy makers and others interested in developing needs-based reimbursement models for Medicaid-funded assisted living with an evaluation of different methodologies that affect the structure and outcomes of these models.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used assessment data from Medicaid-enrolled assisted living residents and waiver-eligible community-dwelling individuals (N = 726) in order to evaluate five methodologies in the design of these tiered needs-based models. We used ordinary least squares regression analyses in order to evaluate each model\\'s ability to predict the time needed to care for individuals with varying needs (e.g., activities of daily living limitations, dementia, special services.)\\u2003Results:\\u2002These models varied in fit from.127 to a high of.357 using the adjusted R2 statistic. Both count and weighted models adequately predicted service needs and discriminated individuals into their appropriate tiers well. Weighted models with the largest score range worked best and provided more flexibility.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Policy makers can tailor the generic tiered models developed with these methods to a state\\'s population. Any state considering adoption of a needs-based tiered model will need to refine its model based on its assisted living population characteristics, its resources, and how the model fits its long-term care system. For the industry, these models can serve to identify levels of care needed in planning for staff time and skill mix required for assisted living as well as other long-term care populations. Purpose: This study examines the extent and independent correlates of congruence between disabled elders and their caregivers on several aspects of the caregiving experience. Design and Methods: Participants were 117 visually impaired elders and their caregivers. Correlational analyses, kappa statistics, and paired t tests were used to examine the extent of congruence. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified significant correlates of congruence on four target issues: elder\\'s functional disability, elder\\'s adaptation to vision impairment, caregiver\\'s overprotectiveness, and caregiver\\'s understanding of the vision problem. Results: Caregivers assessed elders as more disabled and rated themselves as more overprotective than did the elders. Although independent correlates varied by target issue, two domains most consistently influenced congruence across measures: the caregiver\\'s assessment of the elder\\'s status and quality of the relationship. Implications: Findings underscore the importance of addressing congruence by target issue, rather than as a global characteristic of the caregiving relationship. Purpose: This research examines the impact of rural–urban residence on formal home-care utilization among older people and determines whether and how Medicaid coverage influences the association between rural–urban location and risk of formal home-care use. Design and Methods: We combined data from the 1998 consolidated file of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component with data from the Area Resource File to generate the analytical data set. We established two measures of formal home-care utilization: home care reimbursed through any source, and Medicare-reimbursed home health care. Our measures of rural–urban residence included metropolitan counties, nonmetropolitan counties having towns of at least 10,000 people, and nonmetropolitan counties with no towns of 10,000 people. We used logistic regression analyses to examine main effects and interaction effects of Medicaid coverage and residence on the two types of formal home care under controls for person-level characteristics and state fixed effects. Results: The unadjusted logistic analyses demonstrate that older people who reside in the most rural counties (nonmetropolitan counties having no town of 10,000) are significantly more likely than metropolitan residents to use any formal home care and Medicare home health care. The fully adjusted logistic analysis results point to an interplay between residential status and Medicaid coverage with regard to formal home-care use. In comparison with metropolitan residents covered by Medicaid, the adjusted relative risk of any formal home-care use is significantly higher for Medicaid enrollees residing in nonmetropolitan counties having no town of 10,000 people. Use of Medicare home health care is significantly greater for residents of the most rural counties, irrespective of their Medicaid coverage, as well as Medicaid-covered residents of nonmetropolitan counties having a town of at least 10,000 people. Implications: In nonmetropolitan areas, Medicaid may be an important mechanism for linking older individuals with formal home care, especially Medicare home health care, and with the services that generate formal home care. Formal home care, including Medicare home health care, may substitute for less available forms of care in the most rural of nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, policies that limit access to formal home care could lead to increased service-related vulnerabilities among older rural residents. Purpose:\\u2002We used data from a large sample of nursing homes to examine the association between staff turnover and quality.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The staff turnover measures came from primary data collected from 2,840 nursing homes in 2004 (representing a 71% response rate). Data collection included measures for nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, and registered nurses. We examined 14 indicators of care quality that came from the Nursing Home Compare Web site. \\u2003Results:\\u2002We found that reducing turnover from high to medium levels was associated with increased quality, but the evidence was mixed regarding the quality improvements from further lowering turnover to low levels.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Our investigation shows that the relationship between turnover and quality might not be linear. Nevertheless, in general, high turnover is associated with poor quality. Purpose: This study examined the relation of dual and single sensory impairments, within the context of cognitive function, by using the framework of everyday competence in terms of the probability of difficulty with specific personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs and IADLs, respectively). Design and Methods: The Longitudinal Study on Aging, composed of individuals aged 70 and older in 1984 (N = 5,151), provided data for the present analyses. In each IADL and ADL domain, binary logistic regressions assessed the probability of difficulty associated with sensory impairment and cognitive status after sociodemographic and physical health covariates were controlled for. Results: One fifth of older adults reported dual sensory impairment, which was associated with greater IADL than ADL task difficulty compared with single sensory loss. Further, high levels of dual impairment were shown to increase the risk of difficulty in three of six IADL tasks (preparing meals, shopping, and using the telephone) over vision impairment alone. Overall, cognitive status was a significant predictor of both ADL and IADL difficulties, which was not expected from the everyday competence framework. Implications: Findings highlight the importance of sensory resources for everyday competence and suggest the need for effective vision and hearing rehabilitation to assist older adults in improving or maintaining their functional independence. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to describe the grief and personal growth experience of spouses and adult children of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease and related dementias and the factors contributing to these experiences.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a modification of the Marwit–Meuser–Sanders Caregiver Grief model to examine the factors that contribute to grief and personal growth. We used chi-square tests, t tests, multivariate analyses of variance, correlations, and hierarchical regression analyses in a cross-sectional analysis of 201 spouses and adult children caregivers at various stages of the disease trajectory.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Grief increased as the severity of the disease increased. When the spouse with Alzheimer\\'s disease lived out of the home, spouse caregivers experienced more sadness and longing, worry and isolation, and personal sacrifice burden than did adult children caregivers. Different factors influence grief and personal growth for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease. The majority of caregivers experienced personal growth, with more growth experienced by adult children.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Health care providers should consider using the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory to screen for high levels of grief in caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Supportive services targeted for those with high levels of grief are suggested. This study investigated the availability of printed human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) education/prevention materials from state departments of public health within the United States, which specifically targeted the older adult population. Information on HIV/AIDS from public health departments in each of the 50 states was solicited, obtained, and analyzed for applicability to an older adult population. Although all 50 states responded to our request for publications, only 15 states (30%) provided publications that were specifically intended for an older adult audience. The title, date of publication, and publisher of publications that were considered “specific to older adults” are provided. These findings suggest that there is a general lack of HIV/AIDS prevention literature specifically tailored for older adults available through state departments of public health. Purpose: The probability of anticipated return migration in retirees is explored. Design and Methods: Survey data were analyzed from interviews with a sample of elderly European Americans who migrated to a metropolitan city on Florida\\'s east coast following retirement. Results: Results are consistent with the specification of the 2nd move in E. Litwak and C. F. Longino 1987 life course model of retirement migration. Respondents were unlikely to anticipate a return move unless ties to the back home community made such a move possible. Implications: Ties with children, both back home and in Florida, significantly influence consideration of a return move. Purpose:\\u2002Residential care/assisted living facilities have become an alternative to nursing homes for many individuals, yet little information exists about staffing in these settings and the effect of staffing. This study analyzed the intensity and skill mix of nursing staff using data from a four-state study, and their relationship to outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We obtained longitudinal data for 1,894 residents of 170 residential care/assisted living facilities participating in the Collaborative Studies of Long-Term Care. Descriptive statistics assessed the levels of direct care staff (registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, personal care aide). Regression analyses evaluated the relationship between two staffing measures (intensity measured as care hours per resident and skill mix measured as the percentage of total care hours by licensed nurses), facility characteristics, and four health outcomes (mortality, nursing home transfer, hospitalization, and incident morbidity). \\u2003Results:\\u2002Care hours per resident decreased with facility size (economies of scale) only for very small facilities and increased with dementia prevalence (case-mix effect). Licensed staff accounted for a greater proportion of total hours in nonprofit settings. Health outcomes did not vary by total care hours per resident, but hospitalization rates were significantly lower in facilities with higher proportions of skilled staff hours; this effect was stronger as dementia case mix increased.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Current staffing levels for the outcomes analyzed meet most residents\\' needs. Reduced hospitalization in relation to greater use of licensed staff suggests that increased use of these workers might result in reductions in acute care expenditures. Purpose:\\u2002This study assessed the impact of a low cost, multicomponent physical activity intervention for older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis. Design and Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of a facility-based multiple-component training program followed by home-based adherence (n = 80) to a wait list control group (n = 70). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 2 and 6 months following randomization. The training program consisted of range of motion, resistance training, aerobic walking, and education–group problem solving regarding self-efficacy for exercise and exercise adherence. All training group participants developed individualized plans for posttraining adherence. Results: Relative to the persons in the control group, individuals who participated in the exercise program experienced a statistically significant improvement in exercise efficacy, a 48.5% increase in exercise adherence, and a 13.3% increase in 6-min distance walk that were accompanied by significant decreases in lower extremity stiffness at 2 and 6 months. Program participants also experienced a significant decrease in lower extremity pain and a borderline significant improvement in efficacy to adhere to exercise over time at 6 months (p =.052). In contrast, persons in the control group deteriorated over time on the efficacy and adherence measures and showed no change on the other measures. No adverse health effects were encountered. Implications: These benefits indicate that this low-cost intervention may hold great promise as one of a growing number of public health intervention strategies for older adults in the United States with osteoarthritis. Purpose:\\u2002This article is a critical review the history, research evidence, and state-of-the-art technology in interdisciplinary care planning and the written plan of care in American nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods: We reviewed educational and empirical literature.Results: Interdisciplinary care planning and the written care plan are mandated processes that are imbedded in the regulatory fabric and routines of the American nursing home. These processes evolved from the discipline of nursing, where care planning has had a long and controversial history.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Practice implications are provided. Purpose: To develop a screening system for Michigan\\'s MI Choice publicly funded home- and community-based services programs, to aid in identifying both individuals eligible for services and their most appropriate level of care (LOC). Design and Methods: Identify assessment items from the Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS-HC) assessment instrument that are predictive of five LOCs determined by expert care managers: nursing home, home care, intermittent personal care, homemaker, and information and referral (without services). Results: The algorithm based on approximately 30 client characteristics agrees with expert opinions substantially better (κ = .62) than systems based on activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living only (κ < .40). Implications: The screening algorithm can be used both over the telephone to identify clients who will not be fully assessed (as they are unlikely to receive services) and in person to recommend the appropriate LOC. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this report is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the five-item Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC), a measure that can guide determination of an older adult\\'s capacity to consent for research.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Information was obtained from 346 nursing home residents from six facilities who were being enrolled into a randomized controlled trial testing a restorative care intervention. In addition to the ESC, the resident\\'s cognitive status and demographic information was obtained.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The average age of the participants was 86.1 ± 7.3 years; most of the participants were female (84%) and Caucasian (95%). The mean Mini-Mental State Exam score was 18.0 ± 7.4. A total of 218 residents (63%) did not pass the ESC. According to a Rasch analysis and the inter-rater reliability (r =.81), there was some evidence of reliability and validity with this measure. Logistic regression showed that Items 1 (describing two risks to participation in the study) and 2 (knowing what is associated with participation) had the greatest overall percentage of agreement with the full ESC, and the Mini-Mental State Exam was the only resident-tested variable to predict the results of the ESC.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study provides useful information about the ESC. It indicates a reason and a method to move beyond cognitive testing that can more appropriately evaluate the capacity to consent to participate in research. Purpose:\\u2002Caregiving research has typically relied on cross-sectional data that focus on the primary caregiver. This approach neglects the dynamic and systemic character of caregiver networks. Our analyses addressed changes in adult child care networks over a 2-year period.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study relied on pooled data from Waves 1 through 5 of the Health and Retirement Study. Based on a matrix of specific adult child caregivers across two consecutive time points, we assessed changes in any adult child caregiver as well as in the primary adult child caregiver.\\u2003Results:\\u2002More than half of all adult-child care networks, including more than one fourth of primary adult child caregivers, changed between waves. Gender composition of the caregiver network and availability of other adult child caregivers were particularly important for network change, but socioeconomic context, caregiver abilities and resources, and caregiver burden played a role as well.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results underline the need to shift caregiving research toward a dynamic life course and family systems perspective. They also raise concerns about the viability of informal care networks for future smaller birth cohorts and suggest that health care providers need to recognize and address coordination and potential conflicts among care network members. Purpose: This study compares health and functional outcomes and health care utilization of persons with dementia residing in residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities and nursing homes. Design and Methods: The study uses data from a longitudinal cohort study of 1,252 residents with dementia in 106 RC/AL facilities and 40 nursing homes in four states. Results: Rates of mortality; new or worsening morbidity; and change in activities of daily living, cognition, behavioral problems, depressive symptoms, social function, and withdrawal did not differ between the two settings. However, because of death or transfer, only about one half of the persons with mild dementia and one third of those with moderate to severe dementia remained in RC/AL facilities 1 year after enrollment. In addition, hospitalization rates were greater among individuals with mild dementia in RC/AL facilities, largely because of a medically unstable subgroup with high nursing-home-transfer rates. Implications: Many persons with dementia can be served equally well in either setting; however, those with major medical care needs may benefit from nursing home residence. Purpose:\\u2002The neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease are a major contributor to caregiver distress and burden. Despite recent efforts to teach caregivers skills to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduce burden, there continues to be limited evidence that these strategies have helped caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease to effectively manage neuropsychiatric symptoms. We report here on Project CARE, a randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of a caregiver-based multicomponent behavioral intervention aimed to reduce caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as general caregiver burden, and to decrease neuropsychiatric symptom severity among individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The behavioral intervention involved five weekly sessions designed to teach caregivers specific techniques for managing patient neuropsychiatric symptoms in the home environment. Through the use of a randomized control trial, 80 caregivers were assigned to either the behavioral intervention group or a psychoeducational control group and were assessed both before and after the intervention.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Compared with caregivers in the control group, caregivers in the behavioral intervention group displayed significantly greater reductions in caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms (p =.005). Global caregiver burden, however, did not decrease significantly for caregivers in either group (p >.05). Although it was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward greater reductions in care recipients\\' neuropsychiatric symptom severity in the intervention group (p =.10). Implications:\\u2002The current findings suggest that targeted, group-based behavioral interventions are effective for reducing distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms among caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease and for reducing care recipients\\' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Purpose:We examine 6-month effects of the Environmental Skill-Building Program on caregiver well-being and care recipient functioning and whether effects vary by caregiver gender, race (White or non-White), and relationship (spouse or nonspouse). Design and Methods:We enrolled 255 family caregivers of community-residing persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease or related disorders, of whom 190 participated in a follow-up interview. Caregivers were randomized to a usual care control group or intervention group that received five home contacts and one telephone contact by occupational therapists, who provided education, problem-solving training, and adaptive equipment. Baseline and 6-month follow-up included self-report measures of caregiver objective and subjective burden, caregiver well-being, and care recipient problem behaviors and physical function.Results:Compared with controls (n = 101), intervention caregivers (n = 89) reported less upset with memory-related behaviors, less need for assistance from others, and better affect. Intervention spouses reported less upset with disruptive behaviors; men reported spending less time in daily oversight; and women reported less need for help from others, better affect, and enhanced management ability, overall well-being, and mastery relative to control group counterparts. Statistically significant treatment differences were not found for hours helping with instrumental activities of daily living, upset with providing assistance with instrumental activities of daily living and activities of daily living, perceived change in somatic symptoms, White versus non-White caregivers, or care recipient outcomes. Implications:The Environmental Skill-Building Program reduces burden and enhances caregiver well-being in select domains and has added benefit for women and spouses. Purpose:\\u2002When cognitively impaired nursing home residents exhibit agitated and aggressive behaviors during bathing, nursing home caregivers are in a unique position to improve residents\\' experience. This report addresses whether certified nursing assistants (CNAs) who received training in a person-centered approach with showering and with the towel bath showed improved caregiving behaviors (gentleness and verbal support) and experienced greater preparedness (confidence and ease) and less distress (hassles) when assisting residents with bathing.Design and Methods:We used a crossover design and randomized 15 nursing homes into two treatment groups and a control group of 5 facilities each. In one treatment group, CNAs received person-centered training, first with showering for 6 weeks (Time 1) and then with the towel bath for 6 weeks (Time 2). We reversed the treatment order in the other treatment group. Control group CNAs used usual showering procedures without person-centered training. We collected observational and self-report data at baseline and at the end of Time 1 and Time 2 on five caregiving outcomes. We analyzed data from 37 CNAs assisting 69 residents by using 3 × 2 repeated measures analyses of variance to compare the three groups on change from baseline. Results:Compared with the control group, treatment groups significantly improved in the use of gentleness and verbal support and in the perception of ease. Implications:A person-centered approach with showering and with the towel bath improved not only how care is given to residents who become agitated and aggressive during bathing but also how CNAs perceive their experience when bathing these residents. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an activity implemented by means of Resident-Assisted Montessori Programming (RAMP). Design and Methods: Four persons with early-stage dementia were trained to serve as leaders for a small-group activity played by nine persons with more advanced dementia. Assessments of leaders\\' ability to learn the procedures of leading a group, as well as their satisfaction with this role, were taken, as were measures of players\\' engagement and affect during standard activities programming and RAMP activities. Results: Leaders demonstrated the potential to fill the role of group activity leader effectively, and they expressed a high level of satisfaction with this role. Players\\' levels of positive engagement and pleasure during the RAMP activity were higher than during standard group activities. Implications: This study suggests that to the extent that procedural learning is available to persons with early-stage dementia, especially when they are assisted with external cueing, these individuals can successfully fill the role of volunteers when working with persons with more advanced dementia. This can provide a meaningful social role for leaders and increase access to high quality activities programming for large numbers of persons with dementia. Purpose:\\u2002This study explored aspects of stigmatization for older adults who live in residential care or assisted living (RC–AL) communities and what these settings have done to address stigma.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used ethnography and other qualitative data-gathering and analytic techniques to gather data from 309 participants (residents, family and staff) from six RC–AL settings in Maryland. We entered the transcript data into Atlas.ti 5.0. We analyzed the data by using grounded theory techniques for emergent themes. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Four themes emerged that relate to stigma in RC–AL: (a) ageism in long-term care; (b) stigma as related to disease and illness; (c) sociocultural aspects of stigma; and (d) RC–AL as a stigmatizing setting. Some strategies used in RC–AL settings to combat stigma include family member advocacy on behalf of stigmatized residents, assertion of resident autonomy, and administrator awareness of potential stigmatization.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Findings suggest that changes could be made to the structure as well as the process of care delivery to minimize the occurrence of stigma in RC–AL settings. Structural changes include an examination of how best, given the resident case mix, to accommodate care for persons with dementia (e.g., separate units or integrated care); processes of care include staff recognition of resident preferences and strengths, rather than their limitations. Purpose:\\u2002Although increased participation in physical activity by older adults is a major public health goal, little is known about the supply and use of physical activity programs in the United States. Design and Methods: Seven academic centers in diverse geographic areas surveyed physical activity programs for older adults. Five sites conducted surveys by mail with telephone follow-up, and two administered surveys primarily by telephone. Reported program attendance rates were compared with local census data to assess unmet needs. Results: Of the 2,110 targeted facilities, 77% responded. Aerobic programs were offered by 73%, flexibility by 47%, and strength training by 26%. Commercial gyms or YMCAs, senior centers, park or recreation centers, and senior-housing facilities offered 90% of available programs. The 2000 Census enumerated 1,123,401 total older adults across the seven sites. Facilities reported 69,634 individuals as current weekly program participants, equaling 6% of the sites\\' total older-adult population. This percentage varied from 3% in Pittsburgh to 28% in Colorado. Implications: Based on conservative estimates of demand, the number of physical activity programs would have to increase substantially (by 78%) to meet the needs of older adults. The data also indicate the need to develop more strength-training programs and to engage a higher percentage of older adults in these programs. There is a clear need to stimulate demand for programs through health promotion. Purpose:\\u2002We address how the national prevalence of cognitive impairment can be estimated from two nationally representative surveys. Design and Methods: Data are from the 1999–2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 1999 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). The NHIS represents all community-dwelling people living in the United States, and the NNHS is representative of all nursing home residents. \\u2002Results:\\u2002NHIS data show that there are approximately 800,000 community-based elders aged 65 and older with reported confusion or memory loss, and 2.3 million elders with reported limitation of activity caused by senility or dementia. There are an estimated 632,000 nursing home residents aged 65 and older with a reported diagnosis of dementia.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Estimates of the prevalence of cognitive impairment that are based on nationally representative data are rare, because comprehensively evaluating a national sample by using standard, validated cognitive-impairment assessment methods is difficult and expensive, and because most national surveys are broad based and designed to cover a wide variety of topics. Crude measures of cognitive impairment, such as the presence of confusion or memory loss or limitations caused by senility or dementia, that are included in these multipurpose surveys may be only rough proxies for clinically evaluated cognitive impairment, but they do appear to produce prevalence estimates that are similar to estimates found with the use of more precise case-ascertainment methods. These nationally representative data sets may be used to generate hypotheses related to the prevalence, epidemiology, and health care utilization patterns of people with cognitive impairment that can be tested in studies using more specific case-ascertainment criteria. The “new gerontology,” built on the concept of successful aging, sets forth the preconditions for and the end product of the process of aging successfully. Focused on health and active participation in life, it vests largely within individuals the power to achieve this normatively desirable state. While acknowledging the contributions of the scientific base for Rowe and Kahn\\'s successful aging model, we emphasize the need for a more careful examination of the model itself. Using critical gerontology as a primary filter, we critique this normative vision by focusing on its unarticulated (and perhaps unexplored) values, assumptions, and consequences. We argue that these unexamined features may further harm older people, particularly older women, the poor, and people of color who are already marginalized. We conclude by suggesting forms of resistance to this univocal standard. Purpose:\\u2002Older adults are less likely than any other age group to use the federal Food Stamp Program. The personal and social costs of elderly diet insufficiency include disease exacerbation, depression, and increased hospitalization. In order to improve targeting and outreach efforts, this study identifies the characteristics of eligible older Americans who are not receiving food stamps and assesses the validity of the Andersen behavioral model for predicting impoverished older adults food stamp use.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2003 American Community Survey, which is a nationally representative survey with a response rate of 96.7%. We restricted our study subsample to the 14,724 impoverished American citizens who were aged 65 years and older. We used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to compare the 2,796 food stamp recipients with the 11,928 nonrecipients.\\u2003Results:\\u2002One in five impoverished older American citizens had received foods stamps in the preceding year. Female respondents, renters, younger respondents, disabled individuals, and those who received Supplemental Security Income or welfare were more likely to receive food stamps. The pseudo-R-square value indicated that the Andersen Behavioral Model explained 28% of the model\\'s variability.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Improved targeting is needed to enhance older adults\\' participation rates. Mobile and satellite food stamp offices in lower income neighborhoods and other innovative outreach programs that collaborate with community partners could also improve access. With the vast majority of impoverished older adults not receiving food stamps, strategies such as these are extremely important to rectify this situation among the most vulnerable group of older Americans. Purpose:\\u2002The first Elder Abuse Forensic Center (EAFC) in the United States was instituted in 2003. People from a variety of disciplines, including Adult Protective Services social workers, law enforcement, the district attorney\\'s office, a medical response team, public guardian deputies, ombudsmen, mental health services, a victim advocate, and a domestic violence expert work cooperatively on cases of elder and dependent-adult mistreatment. Researchers conducted an assessment of the EAFC\\'s impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the collaboration.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods included statistical analysis of data from outcome surveys of EAFC collaborators and illustrative case studies developed from case files and structured interviews.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Mean survey scores evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the collaboration were significantly better than neutral responses. Case studies show efficient and effective case management through cooperation of the collaborating agencies. Survey results clearly support perceptions exemplified in case studies.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002An EAFC enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of those who address elder abuse in one community, which in turn leads to improved outcomes. Continued analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, and cost effectiveness of the EAFC model is ongoing. Purpose:\\u2002The Early Diagnosis Dyadic Intervention (EDDI) program provides a structured, time-limited protocol of one-on-one and dyadic counseling for family caregivers and care receivers who are in the early stages of dementia. The goals and procedures of EDDI are based on previous research suggesting that dyads would benefit from an intervention that increases the care receiver\\'s active participation in his or her care plan, develops positive communication patterns between the caregiver and care receiver, increases knowledge and understanding about available services, and assists the dyad through the emotional turbulence of a diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease or other dementing condition. Design and Methods:\\u2002EDDI was developed in response to research and clinical findings that suggested that care dyads in the early stages of dementia and dementia care are able to engage in a dialogue about future preferences for care, and that this discussion could address some of the uncertainty and worry experienced by each member of the dyad. As part of a feasibility trial, 31 dyads participated in the EDDI program. Measures were obtained on the intervention\\'s implementation, including the number of sessions attended, caregiver and care receiver ratings of treatment acceptability and effectiveness, and counselor ratings of treatment effectiveness. Results:\\u2002Participant and counselor evaluations of the EDDI protocol indicated that the intervention was acceptable and satisfactory to the caregivers, care receivers, and counselors, and that the intervention\\'s goals and objectives were achievable. Implications:\\u2002These findings indicate that individuals with early-stage dementia and their family caregivers are able to participate in and benefit from a structured intervention that focuses on care planning for future needs. Purpose:This study investigated the physical environment and organizational factors that influenced the process of providing care to terminally ill nursing home residents.Design and Methods:Participant observation, interviews, and event analysis were used to obtain data in two proprietary facilities.Results:The physical environment was not conducive to end-of-life care. The rooms were crowded, there was little privacy, and the facilities were noisy. Inadequate staffing and lack of supervision were among the most significant organizational factors that influenced care. Often, residents did not receive basic care, such as bathing, oral hygiene, adequate food and fluids, and repositioning. A consequence of inadequate staffing was the development of pressure ulcers; 54% of the residents had pressure ulcers; 82% of these residents died with pressure ulcers.Implications:Findings suggest that the nursing home environment in these two facilities, as now structured, is an inappropriate setting for end-of-life care. Purpose: Our purpose in the current study was to examine the relationship between health services utilization delivered by means of the Homeless Outreach Medical Services (HOMES) program and health services utilization delivered by means of the Parkland emergency room and inpatient units among a sample of older and younger homeless adults being served by the Parkland Health and Hospital System.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The HOMES program uses two 40-ft-long mobile medical units and a fixed-site outpatient clinic to provide primary health care on a walk-in, no-charge basis to individuals who are homeless. We used a quasi-experimental design, and we randomly selected health services utilization data from 293 male (50.4%) and 288 female (49.6%) homeless patients from among the 14,876 homeless patients aged 20–64 years who used HOMES and the Parkland Health and Hospital System between June 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999. The dependent variables were measurements of inpatient and outpatient utilization of psychiatric, substance abuse, and musculoskeletal services by homeless patients. Inpatient and outpatient utilization patterns by age were assessed. Data were analyzed using a split-plot repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and simple linear regression.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Older homeless individuals utilized the HOMES more than inpatient services for substance abuse and musculoskeletal conditions, but they utilized inpatient services the most for psychiatric-related conditions.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This level of inpatient utilization is perhaps a result of greater severity or progression of mental illness among older homeless adults. The level of outpatient utilization is probably because the HOMES program mitigates many of the barriers that prevent homeless individuals from obtaining primary medical care. Purpose: As funds have increased for the provision of in-home care, so too have concerns about the quality of services. In response, care management agencies and home-care providers have developed an array of monitoring activities designed to ensure the quality of services. In this article, we show how an area agency on aging both collected and used data to improve the quality of a network of in-home services. Design and Methods: Data came from more than 4,200 consumers enrolled in a community-based long-term-care program operated by the agency. In addition, other indicators of quality, such as elapsed time to service, were also collected. The area agency combined these data into part of a provider quality report it produced. Results: The provider quality report showed considerable variation across the more than 80 providers delivering services. The report also included examples of how data could be used to improve the quality of in-home services. Implications: Many home-care agencies now collect data from and about consumers participating in their programs. Often, however, these organizations do not have a good plan for actually using the data. This study demonstrates how to use consumer information to improve the quality of services delivered. Purpose:\\u2002Caregiver bereavement adjustment literature suggests opposite models of impact of role strain on bereavement adjustment after care-recipient death—a Complicated Grief Model and a Relief Model. This study tests these competing models for husband and adult-daughter caregivers of breast cancer hospice patients.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study used secondary data from the National Hospice Study ( Greer & Mor, 1987). Stepwise multiple regression analyses, using caregiver\\'s age and two formulations of prebereavement caregiver role strain as independent variables, predicted grief and despair bereavement adjustment as dependent variables. Results:\\u2002Data from husbands supported a Complicated Grief Model, as greater empirically derived (anxiety and depression symptoms) and theoretically derived (psychological and health strain) caregiver role strain formulations both predicted more difficult bereavement adjustment for husbands. Neither model was supported for adult daughters, as neither formulation of caregiver role strain predicted daughters\\' bereavement adjustment. Older caregiver age predicted better bereavement adjustment for both husbands and daughters. Adult daughters experienced more caregiver role strain than husbands did.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The family role relationship between caregiver and patient (husband–wife vs. daughter–mother relationship) affects how caregiving factors influence bereavement adjustment. Purpose: Although there is a body of knowledge relating to the different challenges residents encounter after nursing home placement, less is known about the actual process of how they handle these challenges and adjust after such placement. This study described the process whereby Hong Kong Chinese residents adjust following nursing home placement. Design and Methods: The grounded theory methodology was employed. Data were collected from 98 interviews with 18 residents newly admitted to a nursing home in Hong Kong one week after admission and then monthly until no new information about their adjustment experiences could be discovered. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Results: Newly admitted elders adjusted through the four stages of orienting, normalizing, rationalizing, and stabilizing as they struggled to regain normality with a life that was as close to that lived before admission as possible. A number of experiences suggested in the literature as barriers to adjustment, such as living with rules and regulations, and the communal nature of nursing home life were not regarded as important by Chinese elders. However, establishing relations with other residents was a particular challenge for them. Implications: Interventions to promote adjustment should aim to assist with the process of regaining normality with the different aspects of nursing home living, taking into consideration residents\\' life experience and sociocultural values. Purpose: Adult Protective Services (APS) is the official state entity charged with advocacy for older adults who are victims of elder abuse or self-neglect. However, it has been speculated that APS intervention may lead disproportionately to nursing home placement (NHP). These analyses seek to determine if APS use is an independent risk factor for NHP. Design and Methods: The sample was 2,812 community-dwelling older adults who were aged 65 years or older in 1982 in the New Haven Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly cohort, a subset of whom were referred to elder protective services over a 9-year follow-up period from cohort inception. NHP of cohort members over that time period was determined. Results: Rates of subsequent NHP were: 69.2% for self-neglecting subjects, 52.3% for mistreated subjects, and 31.8% for subjects who had no contact with APS (p < .001, both comparisons). In proportional hazard models that included other demographic, medical, functional, and social factors associated with NHP, the strongest risk factors for placement were APS referral for self-neglect (hazard ratio [HR], 5.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.07–6.72), and for elder mistreatment (HR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.50–6.47). These hazards far exceeded those for other medical, functional, and social factors. Implications: APS use is an independent risk factor for nursing home placement; persons identified by APS as self-neglecting are at the highest risk. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports findings from a nationwide study on factors associated with the perceived effectiveness of state Long Term Care Ombudsman Programs (LTCOPs).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Researchers conducted telephone interviews with ombudsmen from the 50 state programs as well as from Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Data from the National Ombudsman Reporting System were incorporated into the study, and statistical tests analyze associations between self-rated program effectiveness and adequacy of resources, organizational placement–autonomy, interorganizational relationships, and other variables.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Several factors limit the perceived effectiveness of state LTCOPs, including insufficient funding and insufficient LTCOP autonomy caused by organizational placement. Despite these problem areas, state ombudsmen report that their programs meet statutorily mandated requirements with varying degrees of effectiveness. Findings show significant positive associations between program funding and paid and volunteer staff levels and between the ratio of long-term care beds per ombudsman and the percentage of nursing facilities visited. Sufficient funding is positively associated with perceived effectiveness of work with nursing facilities.Implications:\\u2002Sufficient resources, sufficient organizational autonomy, and a supportive political and social environment are key elements in achieving varying types of perceived effectiveness in the state LTCOPs. Research is needed to extend this work to local ombudsman programs and to compare self-rated effectiveness with other outcome measures. Purpose: Supportive services at home are essential for older people with severe chronic impairments. Newer \"consumer-directed\" models of organizing home-based services rely heavily on service recipients rather than home care agencies to arrange and direct care at home. This study examined differences in service experience and outcomes between recipients over and under age 65 who direct their own services in one large Medicaid program. Design and Methods: A random sample of 1,095 recipients of In-Home Supportive Services in California was selected and interviewed by telephone. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, and three Asian languages; those with severe cognitive impairment were excluded from the study. Results: Findings indicate that although younger recipients embrace self-direction more enthusiastically than older ones, age dif-ferences are small on a majority of service outcomes. On average, older users embrace this model and manage within it much like younger users. Some differences emerge between the young-old (65–74) and old-old (75+), but these are neither consistent nor determinative. Implications: Old age is far from an inevitable barrier to self-direction. As with other age groups, there are opportunities and obstacles to be addressed as this newer approach to home care is disseminated. Purpose:\\u2002Despite growing research on assisted living (AL) as a residential care option for older adults, the social ramifications of residents\\' transitions to AL are relatively unexplored. This article examines family involvement in AL, including family structures of residents, types of involvement from family members living outside the AL facility, and outcomes for these family members.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed current literature utilizing the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases to identify AL studies that examined issues pertaining to families or informal care. Following the screening of abstracts, we retrieved 180 reports for further review and selected 62 studies for inclusion.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Families visit residents frequently and provide a wide range of instrumental assistance but provide only minimal personal care. Studies of family outcomes indicated relatively high satisfaction but potential care burden as well.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002How family care and involvement occurs in AL in relation to formal care provision and whether various types of formal/informal care integration influence family outcomes remains unclear. We suggest a research agenda that attempts to tease out causal relationships for family involvement, differentiate family roles, and implement longitudinal analyses for a range of family outcomes. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone support group program on spouses and adult child caregivers of frail older adults. Design and Methods: The Telephone Support Group (TSG) model is a multicomponent group program offered in 12 weekly, 90-minute group sessions. It includes emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies, education, and support. We recruited for this study 36 spouses and 61 adult children and randomly assigned them to TSG or to usual services. We assessed the participants before and after the completion of TSG or usual services. Results: The results indicated that, for adult child caregivers, TSG was more effective than usual services in reducing burden, depression, social support, and pressing problems, and increasing knowledge and use of community services. We found no significant differences for spouse caregivers. Implications: This is the first study to compare the effectiveness of TSG for adult child and spouse caregivers of frail older adults. TSG showed itself to be an effective means of delivering support to adult child caregivers of frail older adults but not to spouses. More research is needed about how to make TSG effective for spouse caregivers. Purpose:\\u2002With the rapid growth in the older inmate population, emerging issues regarding physical and mental health require greater research and clinical attention. We examined the relation of religiousness/spirituality; demographic characteristics such as age, race, and type of crime; and physical and mental health among 73 older male inmates in the state of Alabama.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Inmates older than age 50 who passed a cognitive screening completed face-to-face interviews lasting between 30 and 60 min. Due to the low literacy rates of the participants, we administered all measures orally with response cards to facilitate understanding.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Nearly 70% of the inmates were incarcerated for murder or sexual crimes. There were no racial/ethnic differences in reported religiousness/spirituality, demographic characteristics, or mental health. We found an association between self-reported years of incarceration and experienced forgiveness. Three regression models examined whether inmates\\' self-reported religiousness/spirituality influenced anxiety, depression, and desire for hastened death. We found that having a greater number of daily spiritual experiences and not feeling abandoned by God were associated with better emotional health.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Future studies, perhaps using longitudinal or case-control methodology, should examine whether increased daily spiritual experiences and decreased feelings of abandonment by God foster better mental health among older inmates. Purpose:\\u2002Given concerns about end-of-life care for many nursing home (NH) residents, this study sought to understand factors influencing hospice referral or nonreferral as well as timing of referral.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted semistructured interviews with personnel from seven participating NHs and two hospices. We interviewed NH directors of nursing regarding facility referral practices and conducted interviews with 34 NH nurses, 30 NH aides, and 17 hospice nurses knowledgeable about the factors that led to the hospice status of 32 NH decedents. Selected decedents varied by diagnosis and hospice status (received hospice for >7 days, ≤7 days, or not at all). We audiotaped, transcribed, and coded interviews for themes. \\u2003Results:\\u2002NH staff members\\' recognition of terminal decline, beliefs about hospice, and initiative significantly influenced hospice referral and timing of referral. Staff members\\' recognition of familiar signs of decline facilitated hospice referral; in contrast, a perception that death was unexpected impeded referral, and a perception of uncertain prognosis delayed referral. Staff members\\' beliefs that hospice does not add value to NH care or is for crises only impeded referral, and a belief that hospice is only for the “very end” delayed referral. Residents received hospice for longer periods when staff believed that hospice complemented NH care and when staff took the initiative in raising the option of hospice.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Enhanced training about recognizing terminal decline, hospice services in NHs, and the role of staff initiative would support NH staff in raising the option of hospice when appropriate. Purpose: This study explores the effects of participation in a program designed to enrich friendship and reduce loneliness among women in later life. Several hypotheses based on the need to belong, socioemotional selectivity theory, and the social compensation model were tested. Design and Methods: Study 1 involved two measurement points, one at the end of the program and the other 1-year later. Study 2 used a pretest–post-test control group design with a follow-up measurement. A combination of semistructured interviews and structured questionnaires was used to collect data. A comparison group was also drawn from a nationwide representative sample. Results:Participants were characterized by deprivation on the need to belong; that is, loss of a partner, higher levels of loneliness and negative affect, and lower positive affect compared with a nationwide representative sample of same-aged women. Participants were more likely than women in a control group to report the development of new friendships and an improvement in friendship. The combination of new and improved friendships contributed to a significant reduction in loneliness within a year. There was no evidence of satiation of the need to belong among those who did not expand or improve friendships. Loss of a partner had no influence on friendship development; however, age did. Older participants were less likely to improve friendships. Implications: The action-oriented approach that focused on friendship development in this intervention might be applied to other goals considered important in later life (optimal health, autonomy, harmonious family relations). Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop an instrument to evaluate satisfaction with care for older adults in capitated environments. Although satisfaction with care is now widely accepted as an important outcome measure, there are relatively few satisfaction measures developed or validated on older persons. Because many older persons are unable to respond to surveys, separate instruments were developed for individuals and for their families. Design and Methods: There were 402 face-to-face interviews conducted at 11 PACE sites with PACE participants or their family members and a non-PACE group. Scales were constructed by use of factor analysis and were evaluated for internal-consistency reliability, validity, and ability to discriminate. Results: For the participant survey, three factors were identified, but only two exhibited adequate internal consistency (Perceived Access and Perceived Interpersonal Quality). For the family survey, all four identified factors had adequate internal consistency (Perceived Access, Family Pressure, Ease of Access, and Family Involvement). The participant survey discriminated between the PACE sites and the non-PACE sites, but the family-member survey did not. Implications: The PACE Satisfaction Survey appears to have adequate reliability and validity for measuring the satisfaction of older persons and their family members with capitated care. The domains of satisfaction differ between individuals and family members. Purpose: We reviewed the research literature on racial or ethnic diversity and end-of-life decision making in order to identify key findings and provide recommendations for future research. Design and Methods: We identified 33 empirical studies in which race or ethnicity was investigated as either a variable predicting treatment preferences or choices, where racial or ethnic groups were compared in their end-of-life decisions, or where the end-of-life decision making of a single minority group was studied in depth. We conducted a narrative review and identified four topical domains of study: advance directives; life support; disclosure and communication of diagnosis, prognosis, and preferences; and designation of primary decision makers. Results: Non-White racial or ethnic groups generally lacked knowledge of advance directives and were less likely than Whites to support advance directives. African Americans were consistently found to prefer the use of life support; Asians and Hispanics were more likely to prefer family-centered decision making than other racial or ethnic groups. Variations within groups existed and were related to cultural values, demographic characteristics, level of acculturation, and knowledge of end-of-life treatment options. Common methodological limitations of these studies were lack of theoretical framework, use of cross-sectional designs, convenience samples, and self-developed measurement scales. Implications: Although the studies are limited by methodological concerns, identified differences in end-of-life decision-making preference and practice suggest that clinical care and policy should recognize the variety of values and preferences found among diverse racial or ethnic groups. Future research priorities are described to better inform clinicians and policy makers about ways to allow for more culturally sensitive approaches to end-of-life care. Purpose: We investigated ethnic differences in caregiver background variables, objective stressors, filial obligations beliefs, psychological and social resources, coping processes, and psychological and physical health. Design and Methods: We used a meta-analysis to integrate the results of 116 empirical studies. Results: Ethnic minority caregivers had a lower socioeconomic status, were younger, were less likely to be a spouse, and more likely to receive informal support. They provided more care than White caregivers and had stronger filial obligations beliefs than White caregivers. Asian-American caregivers, but not African-American and Hispanic caregivers, used less formal support than non-Hispanic White caregivers. Whereas African-American caregivers had lower levels of caregiver burden and depression than White caregivers, we found that Hispanic and Asian-American caregivers were more depressed than their White non-Hispanic peers. However, all groups of ethnic minority caregivers reported worse physical health than Whites. Observed ethnic differences in burden and depression were influenced by study characteristics, such as the type of illness of the care recipient and the representativeness of the sample. Implications: The results suggest that more specific theories are needed to explain differential effects of ethnic minority groups of caregivers. Intervention needs vary, in part, between ethnic groups of caregivers. Purpose:\\u2002Little is known about whether an association exists between agency ownership and length of service among home care patients with different payment sources. This study investigated how for-profit and not-for-profit agencies responded to policy changes in the 1990s with respect to length of service. \\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We examined length of service among 37,364 home care patients using the 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 National Home and Hospice Care Surveys. We used Kaplan–Meier methods and Cox regression models. \\u2003Results:\\u2002After we adjusted for patient and agency characteristics, our results revealed that agency ownership was not associated with length of service for patients with private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare plus Medicaid, or Medicare plus private insurance. This finding was consistent from 1992 through 2000. Length of service among patients with Medicare decreased significantly from 1998 through 2000, but length of service among patients with Medicaid did not change significantly from 1992 through 2000. \\u2003Implications:\\u2002Agency ownership is not associated with patient length of service in home care. Regardless of the policy changes in the home care arena in the 1990s, for-profit and not-for-profit home health agencies behaved similarly with regard to length of service among patients within differently structured payment systems. Purpose: Neglect of older adults accounts for 60% to 70% of all elder-mistreatment reports made to adult protective services. The purpose of this article is to report data from research, using a risk-and-vulnerability model, that captures the independent contributions of both the elder and the caregiver as they relate to the outcome of neglect. Methods: Between February 2001 and September 2003, older adults were screened and recruited through four emergency departments in New York and Tampa. The diagnosis of neglect was made by an expert neglect-assessment team. Elders and their caregivers were then scheduled for separate face-to-face interviews after discharge. Results: Constructs within the risk-and-vulnerability model were examined for scale-score significance based on the outcome diagnosis of neglect. In the risk domain, caregivers\\' functional status, childhood trauma, and personality were statistically significant. In the vulnerability domain, the elders\\' cognitive status, functional status, depression, social support, childhood trauma, and personality were significant. Implications: Findings from this study underscore the value of interdisciplinary assessment teams in emergency departments for screening elder neglect, with attention given to risk factors related to the caregiver and elder vulnerability factors, including reports of childhood trauma. The risk-and-vulnerability model may provide a link between the caregiving and neglect research. Data should be collected independently from both members of the elder–caregiver dyad in order for clinicians to understand factors related to elders who receive the diagnosis of neglect from interdisciplinary teams. Purpose: Advance directive (AD) documents are based on state-specific statutes and vary in terms of content. These differences can create confusion and inconsistencies resulting in a possible failure to honor the health care wishes of people who execute health care documents for one state and receive health care in another state. The purpose of this study was to compare similarities and differences in the content of state AD documents. Design and Methods: AD documents for 50 states and the District of Columbia posted on the Partnership for Caring website were reviewed. States and regions of the country were compared for type or types of documents used and issues included in AD documents. Results: Three states had statutory living will documents only; however, these states did allow for appointment of a health care agent for limited end-of-life decisions. Three states had statutory durable power of attorney for health care documents only, 32 had both statutory living will and durable power of attorney for health care documents, and 13 had statutory forms which combine both types of directive in one document (advance health care directives). Of 8 identified key issues, those addressed by at least 90% of states were designation of a proxy, personal instructions for care, general life-sustaining measures, and terminal illness. When document types were compared, advance health care directive documents included more of the key issues than did living will or durable power of attorney for health care documents (p < .001). Implications: This variability suggests a need for national dialogue to standardize some provisions of AD documents. Purpose: This article describes the progress of our study to examine the advantages and costs of using self-managed nurse aide teams in nursing homes, steps that are being taken to implement such teams, and management strategies being used to manage the teams. Design and Methods: A quasi-experimental design is underway where certified nurse aide (CNA) teams are being established in five nursing homes (NHs) in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and five additional NHs are being treated as comparison NHs. Results: As of March 2004 CNA teams were established in five NHs, and baseline survey data were collected from the CNAs, nurses, residents, and family members in each of these NHs as well as from those in the five comparison homes. Implications: Qualitative analyses show positive effects of CNA teams. Quantitative analyses will not be complete until follow-up survey data are collected 12 months after team implementation. Steps for implementing teams include surveying management to be sure that they want nurse teams; orienting and training the managers, nurses, and nurse aides; and facilitating the teams. Management of the teams includes routine feedback from management to the teams and vice versa while using a give-and-take approach. Purpose:\\u2002This article (a) describes a 10-week, behavioral, activities-based intervention for depression that can be implemented in nursing homes collaboratively with nursing home activities staff and (b) presents data related to its development, feasibility, and preliminary outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We developed BE-ACTIV, which stands for Behavioral Activities Intervention, in two pilot study phases: a treatment development phase and a feasibility–outcome phase with a small, randomized trial. We first piloted the intervention with five depressed residents in a single nursing home in collaboration with the social services and activities staff. The second phase randomized 20 residents from six nursing homes to receive either the intervention or treatment as usual.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The intervention was well received by residents, family, and staff members. Experience with the intervention and input from staff members resulted in modifications to streamline the intervention and improve implementation. Results suggest that BE-ACTIV reduced institutional barriers to participation in pleasant activities, increased resident control over activity participation, increased overall activity participation, and improved depressive symptoms. Despite low power, statistical and graphical comparisons suggest superiority of the intervention over treatment as usual.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Because depression among nursing home residents is prevalent, heterogeneous, and often treatment resistant, there is a need for effective, low-cost interventions that are ecologically acceptable and efficient. BE-ACTIV is a promising intervention; it is brief, addresses institutional barriers, involves facility staff in treatment, and is acceptable to residents. As such, BE-ACTIV merits further evaluation to establish efficacy and effectiveness. Purpose:\\u2002This study examines the short-term impact of two theoretically based psychoeducational small group interventions with distressed caregivers, and it also examines the role of specific moderator and mediator variables on caregiver outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Female participants (N = 169) aged 50 and older who were caring for a community-dwelling relative with a dementing illness were randomly assigned to one of three treatment interventions: anger management, depression management, or a wait-list control group. These interventions took place over a 3- to 4-month period. The primary outcomes examined were anger or hostile mood, depressed mood, frequency of use of positive and negative coping strategies, and perceived caregiving self-efficacy.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Significant main effects in the expected direction were found for changes in most of these measures. Participants in both anger management and depression management groups had significant reductions in their levels of anger or hostility and depression from Time 1 to Time 2 in comparison to participants in the wait-list control group. Use of positive cognitive coping strategies increased in the anger management group only. Self-efficacy significantly increased for participants in both intervention groups, and it was also demonstrated to function as a mediator of intervention effects. Pretreatment levels of depressive symptoms and anger expression style (Anger Expression-Out) moderated the relative effects of the two interventions on mood and coping.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These data are consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of skills training, in small groups, to improve both the affective states and the type of coping strategies used by caregivers. In addition, this study underscores the need to evaluate key pretreatment variables in order to determine which form of treatment may be more compatible with caregiver characteristics and thus more likely to be beneficial to individuals. Purpose: This article reviews the literature on \"The Experience of Dying\" and presents data from a larger, ongoing study of an ethnography of dying in nursing homes. The purpose of the ethnographic study was to investigate the process of providing end-of-life care to residents who were dying in nursing homes. Design and Methods:Participant observation, in-depth interviews, and event analysis were used to obtain data in three nursing facilities. Results: The review of the literature disclosed that research on the experience of dying is limited; most of the studies have been conducted in acute care hospitals among people who were dying of cancer. The ethnographic study found that lack of attention to cultural needs, cognitive status, inadequate staffing, and inappropriate and inadequate communication between health care providers and nursing home residents and their families were the predominant factors that influenced the experience of dying. Implications: Future research is needed on: The experience of dying for patients with dementia, for people in a comatose state, and for non-English speaking patients; symptom management; health care provider/patient–family interaction; the burden of caregiving for families; and the consequences of the constraints within our health care system for people who are dying in various settings. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify reliable predictors of nursing home entry over a 3-year period in a sample of 3,944 persons with dementia who resided in a home setting at baseline. Strengths of the analysis include a multiregional recruitment strategy, incorporation of salient caregiver characteristics, and a 3-year prospective design that allows for the modeling of change in important variables (e.g., care recipient functional status or caregiving indicators) when time to institutionalization is predicted.\\u2003Design and Methods: Data were derived from the control sample of the Medicare Alzheimer\\'s Disease Demonstration Evaluation (MADDE). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict time to institutionalization among individuals with dementia (baseline was enrollment into MADDE). Predictors included care recipient demographics, caregiver demographics, and time-varying measurements of care recipient functional status, caregiving indicators, and service utilization. Indicators of change were also incorporated to capitalize on the prospective data available.\\u2003Results: Although several results were consistent with prior findings, caregiving indicators (i.e., burden and self-rated health) and community-based service use were significant predictors of earlier placement. Change in caregiver instrumental activities of daily living and care recipient activities of daily living were also related to expedited institutionalization.\\u2003Implications: The findings emphasize the importance of incorporating both care recipient and caregiver function and service use patterns when targeting programs designed to prevent or delay institutionalization for people with dementia. Purpose:\\u2002This study was designed to examine the factors associated with the preferences of Alzheimer\\'s disease patients to participate in a decision to use an Alzheimer\\'s disease-slowing medication and how involved their caregivers would let them be in this decision.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Interviews were conducted with 48 patients in the mild-to-moderate stage of Alzheimer\\'s disease and their caregivers. Results: Ninety-two percent of patients indicated they would participate in an Alzheimer\\'s disease treatment decision, whereas 71% of caregivers thought the patient would participate. Half of the caregivers who indicated that their relatives would participate had relatives who did not have the capacity to make the decision based on a consensus of three expert psychiatrists. Patients\\' insight into their diagnosis and prognosis, and having less cognitive impairment, being a female caregiver, and being a spousal caregiver were all associated with the likelihood that the patient would participate in the treatment decision. Patients talked about wanting to be involved in the process of making a treatment decision, whereas caregivers talked about assessing whether their relative could participate in the process of decision making. Implications: Mild-to-moderate stage Alzheimer\\'s disease patients want to be involved in making treatment decisions, and caregivers are generally willing to involve them. Caregivers of Alzheimer\\'s disease patients talk about patient participation in relation to elements of the capacity to make a treatment decision. Clinicians can provide guidance and education to assist caregivers in understanding how to assess their relatives\\' abilities to make decisions and navigate the decision-making process. Purpose:\\u2002This study used the Disablement Process Model to predict whether a sample of the oldest-old maintained their disability or disability-free status over a 2- and 4-year follow-up, or whether they transitioned into a state of disability during this time.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We followed a sample of 149 Swedish adults who were 86 years of age or older over a period of 4 years; we grouped them by ability in activities of daily living as being functional survivors (nondisabled over time), increasingly disabled (initially nondisabled but later disabled), chronically disabled (disabled at all waves), or deceased. We used variables from baseline to predict group membership into these four longitudinal outcome groups. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Results indicated that demographic factors, physical impairments, physical and cognitive limitations, and psychosocial variables at baseline predicted membership into the functional survivor group after 2 years and most continued to distinguish between functional survivors and other groups after 4 years.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings indicate key variables that may be useful in predicting shorter term longitudinal changes in disability. By understanding the physical, cognitive, and psychological variables that predict whether a person develops a disability within the next 2 or 4 years, we may be better able to plan for care or implement appropriate interventions. Purpose:\\u2002This study examines whether the relationship between making familial wealth transfers and becoming a Medicaid recipient sheds light on the current debate about Medicaid estate planning, whereby some elders transfer their assets to their families to qualify for Medicaid.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using the Health and Retirement Study, we tracked a national sample of community-based elders who did not receive Medicaid at the 1993 baseline interview but became Medicaid recipients during a 10-year time period and examined wealth transfers for these new Medicaid beneficiaries.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Among elders aged 70 or older who did not receive Medicaid in 1993, 16.4% became Medicaid recipients over 10 years. Among these new Medicaid recipients, 17.9% transferred their wealth to family members before receiving Medicaid benefits, with an average transfer amount of $8,507 during the 2 years prior to receiving Medicaid benefits. In addition, 15.2% of community-residing elders entered a nursing home during the 10-year period, and 26.3% of these were covered by Medicaid. Of these new Medicaid recipients living in nursing homes, 12.6% transferred wealth to their families in the mean amount of $4,112.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Familial wealth transfers do occur before changes in Medicaid eligibility in a small, but nontrivial, number of cases, but the amount transferred is modest, especially among nursing home residents. This finding implies that policies to reduce Medicaid long-term-care expenditures by limiting such transfers may not be very effective. Purpose.\\u2002Even though consumer-directed care models are being advocated for use among elder populations, there are few data on the extent of elder interest in participating in the management of community long-term-care services, who they want involved in making these decisions, or their perceptions regarding the relative importance of different service choices. In addition, little is known about how elder preferences for consumer direction may vary by race/ethnicity.\\u2003Design and Methods.\\u2002With use of a cross-sectional research design, a sample of 731 elders including 200 African American, 200 Chinese, 131 Latino, and 200 White Western European American elders was investigated. New measures were created to assess level of control desired by elders in different areas of community long-term-care service delivery and preference for consumer direction.\\u2003Results. Multivariate analyses found significant differences between and within race/ethnic groups for preferences for levels of consumer-directed care.\\u2003Implications.\\u2002Study findings suggest that consumer direction occurs along a continuum, with elders desiring control over some service areas but not others, and the importance of recognizing heterogeneity within racial/ethnic groups regarding consumer-directed care. Purpose:\\u2002Advance directives are important planning and decision-making tools for individuals in nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002By using the nursing facility Minimum Data Set, we examined the prevalence of advance directives at admission and 12 months post-admission.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The prevalence of having any advance directive at admission declined slightly from 2000 to 2004, whereas the prevalence of having any advanced directive at 12 months after admission increased slightly during the same period. Compared with admissions, residents at 12 months post-admission were more likely to have their decisions made by family members and to have advance directives of any type.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results suggest that greater use of advance directives in nursing homes may depend on additional information and support from nursing facility personnel and the health and social services professionals who are in contact with individuals moving toward nursing home admission, as well as those who remain in facilities over time. Purpose:\\u2002This study describes the mental health status of community-living frail elders in Michigan and identifies subgroups of individuals who are vulnerable to mental health problems.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed the baseline assessment data collected from older adults who were admitted to two community-based long-term-care programs in Michigan (N = 18,939).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results show that 40.5% of the individuals in the sample have recognized mental disorders, 39.6% use psychotropic medications, 24.5% have probable depression, and 1.4% have self-injury thoughts or attempts. Frail elders who are White, younger, and female—as well as those who experience more pain, disease burden, cognitive impairment, and limitations in instrumental activities of daily living—are more prone to psychological distress.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Mental health care is greatly needed by community-living frail elders. Purpose:\\u2002The study\\'s goals were to understand what changes in management practices would most improve the jobs of frontline workers from the perspective of workers themselves and to analyze differences across settings.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The baseline survey of direct care workers (N = 3,468) conducted as part of the National Study of the Better Jobs Better Care demonstration asked the following: “What is the single most important thing your employer could do to improve your job as a direct care worker?” We coded the open-ended responses and grouped them into categories. We then compared the percentages of workers recommending changes in these categories across settings and interpreted them in the context of previous conceptual frameworks.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002Across settings, workers called for more pay and better work relationships including communication; supervision; and being appreciated, listened to, and treated with respect. The fraction of workers calling for these changes and additional specific changes differed substantially across nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and home care agencies.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002To increase retention of frontline workers, policy makers should design public policies and management practices to increase pay and to improve work relationships. However, specific strategies should differ across settings. Purpose:\\u2002Few empirical studies have compared the efficacy between psychoeducational (skill-building) approaches for reducing caregivers\\' psychological distress and interventions modeled after typical community-based support groups. We compare the impact of two distinct interventions on Anglo and Latino caregivers of elderly relatives with dementia. Design and Methods:\\u2002The change from preassessment to postassessment (baseline to 3 months) for 213 female caregivers (122 Anglo and 91 Latino) is presented. They were seen weekly for 10 weeks in either the Coping With Caregiving psychoeducational program (instruction and practice in small groups to learn specific cognitive and behavioral skills) or in the Enhanced Support Group condition (guided discussion and empathic listening to develop reciprocal support within the group). Both programs were tailored to be sensitive to the cultural concerns of Anglo and Latino caregivers, and they were delivered in either English or Spanish by trained interventionists.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, participants in the Coping With Caregiving condition reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, increased use of adaptive coping strategies, and a trend toward decreased use of negative coping strategies when compared with those in the Enhanced Support Group condition. Results were similar for both ethnic groups: there were no main effects for ethnicity, and no significant ethnicity by treatment interaction effects. Implications:\\u2002This study provides empirical support that female caregivers benefit more from a skill-building approach to managing their distress than from support group membership alone. We find it very encouraging that the Latino caregivers responded well on key outcome variables, suggesting that Latinos will participate in clinical research and will benefit from their involvement when services are provided to meet their specific needs. Purpose: The proposed dementia precursor state of mild cognitive impairment is emerging as a primary target of aging research. Yet, little is known about the subjective experience of living with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. This study examines, from the patient\\'s perspective, the experience of living with and making sense of the diagnosis. Design and Methods: We recruited 12 older adults with amnestic or nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment from a university-based memory disorders clinic. We conducted in-home, semistructured interviews in order to elicit rich descriptions of the personal experience of having mild cognitive impairment. We used the qualitative method of grounded theory to analyze narrative data. \\u2002Results:\\u2002Understanding and coming to terms with the syndrome, or assigning meaning, constituted a fundamental aspect of living with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. This process comprised interrelated emotional and cognitive dimensions. Participants employed a range of positive, neutral, and negative phrasing in order to depict their emotional reactions to receiving a diagnosis. Cognitive representations of mild cognitive impairment included both prognosis-focused and face-value appraisals. Expectations of normal aging, personal experience with dementia, and concurrent health problems were key contextual factors that provided the backdrop against which participants assigned meaning to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Implications: Clinicians who disclose diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment need to be mindful of the potential for varying interpretations of the information that is conveyed. Future research needs to include systematic, longitudinal investigations of illness representation and its impact on health behaviors among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Purpose: This study examined the congruence of self-reported medications with computerized pharmacy records. Design and Methods: Pharmacy records and self-reported medications were obtained for 294 members of a state pharmaceutical assistance program who also participated in ACTIVE, a clinical trial on cognitive training in nondemented elderly persons. The average age of the sample participants was 74.5 years (range = 65–91); 87.8% were females. Results: Congruence between self-report and pharmacy data was generally high. Self-reports omitted drug classes in the pharmacy records less often than the pharmacy records did not include self-reported drug classes. The percentage of individuals with perfect agreement between self-reports and pharmacy records varied from 49% for major drug classes to 81% for specific cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs. Within a drug class, agreement tended to be higher for individuals without a prescription in that class. Poorer health was consistently related to poorer self-report of medications. Implications: Self-reported medications are most likely to be congruent with pharmacy records for drugs prescribed for more serious conditions, for more specific classes of drugs, and for healthier individuals. Purpose: We describe the prevalence, types, duration, frequency, and severity of intimate partner violence (“partner violence”) in older women. Design and Methods: We randomly sampled a total of 370 English-speaking women (65 years of age and older) from a health care system to participate in a cross-sectional telephone interview. Using 5 questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and 10 questions from the Women\\'s Experience with Battering (WEB) Scale, we assessed a woman\\'s exposure to partner violence. We estimated lifetime partner violence prevalence using the BRFSS questions (physical, forced intercourse, forced sexual contact, verbal threats, and controlling behavior), and we estimated past-5-year and past-year prevalence using the BRFSS and the WEB Scale. We estimated violence frequency, duration, and severity using the BRFSS questions. Results: According to the BRFSS, lifetime partner violence prevalence was 26.5%; 18.4% of women experienced physical or sexual violence and 21.9% experienced nonphysical violence (threats or controlling behavior). According to the BRFSS and WEB Scale, past-5-year violence prevalence was 3.5%, and past-year violence prevalence was 2.2%. Many abused women reported more than 20 episodes of violence in their lifetime (from 18.1% for physical violence to 61.2% for controlling behavior). The median duration ranged from 3 years (forced sexual contact) to 10 years (controlling behavior). The proportion of abused women rating their abuse as severe ranged from 39.1% (forced sex or sexual contact) to 70.7% (threats). Implications: The high lifetime partner violence occurrence, frequency, duration, and severity, coupled with results from prior studies indicating long-term adverse health effects of partner violence, suggest a need for increased efforts to address partner violence in older women. Architects, environmental designers, occupational therapists, and human service professionals are variously engaged in efforts to create settings for older persons that better fit their changing lifestyles and abilities. This theoretical article argues that to explain and predict more effectively the appropriateness of the settings occupied and used by their older occupants requires models and empirical inquiries that better conceptualize two areas of inquiry: (a) the temporal properties of environments and individuals and (b) the conceptualization of environmental behaviors or activities describing how individuals use, manipulate, or perform tasks in their settings. The types of constructs and relationships necessary for this inquiry are reviewed and their practical applications considered. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate burden experienced by a group of American Indian primary family caregivers and to determine if caregiver burden is a multidimensional concept. Design and Methods: This analysis is based on the results of a survey questionnaire administered to 169 Pueblo primary family caregivers in New Mexico. Results: Analysis of the items composing the Caregiver Burden scale indicated that caregiver burden is multidimensional and consists of several types of burden. Caregiver burden, as identified in this sample, is composed of four dimensions: role conflict, negative feelings, lack of caregiver efficacy, and guilt. Investigations of caregiver burden should consider the multidimensionality of this experience and evaluate burden accordingly. Implications:By identifying the specific type of burden that a caregiver experiences, interventions can be targeted more accurately to support family caregiving. Purpose:\\u2002The aim of this pilot feasibility study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative, Internet-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of older adults with neurodegenerative disease.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002After receiving signed informed consent from each participant, we randomly assigned 66 caregivers to an Internet-based intervention or to a no-intervention control group. The intervention group received computers and training in order to access a password-protected Web site with links to information, e-mail, and threaded discussion. Unique to the Web site was a video-conferencing link that supported caregivers\\' participation in a 10-session, manual-guided psychosocial support group, followed by 12 additional online sessions facilitated by a group member. Participants completed health-status and stress-response measures at baseline and 6-month follow-up.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Content analysis of archived video sessions showed (a) reliable adherence to the manual-guided support-group intervention and (b) online group discussion themes similar to those in face-to-face caregiver support groups. Analyses of stress-response outcome data showed significant between-group differences, with the intervention group experiencing a decline in stress compared with an escalation in stress for the control group. Implications:\\u2002Despite the limitations of this pilot study in terms of limited sample size and 54% dropout of control participants at 6-month follow-up, the results provide preliminary supportive evidence for a technology-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative disease. Purpose: State variation in inclusion of ancillary services in daily Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates, versus covering ancillary costs outside of such rates, makes rate comparisons difficult. The purpose of this study is to adjust for inclusion of ancillaries when comparing Medicaid rates across states. Design and Methods: Data for 1987–1998 were drawn from a national survey of Medicaid reimbursement. Employing a random-effects model, the PANEL option in the LIMDEP software was used to estimate effects on state average Medicaid nursing facility constant-dollar rates of the inclusion in those rates of a set of ancillaries: physical therapy, occupational therapy, prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, durable medical equipment (DME), medical supplies, and physician services. Results: Rates averaged higher when they included occupational therapy, physician services, nonprescription drugs, and both DME and medical supplies. Adjusting for the inclusion of ancillaries leads to a much different ranking of states than for unadjusted rates. Implications: Public and industry policy makers should consider the inclusion of ancillaries in rates when considering the relative adequacy of rates across states. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to discuss the benefits and limitations of, and considerations in, developing a typology of assisted living (AL).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a review and comparison of nine AL typologies drawn from the literature.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Typologies addressed matters related to the structure, process, population, and philosophy of AL to varying degrees. A lack of available data and different sampling frames hindered attempts to quantitatively compare the typologies.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Typologies are potentially useful for consumers, practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. It is advisable to identify state-based typologies and then empirically determine types that have national representation. Stakeholders should consider the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and allow any resulting typology to anticipate ongoing evolution in the field of AL. Purpose:\\u2002Our study assessed whether change in self-rated health is a stronger predictor of mortality than baseline self-rated health and the most recent self-rated health (prior to death or loss to follow-up) among disabled older women. Design and Methods:\\u2002The Women\\'s Health and Aging Study examined disabled older women at baseline and every 6 months for 3 years. During the follow-up period, 253 out of the 905 examined participants died. Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used. Results:\\u2002After baseline characteristics were adjusted for, baseline self-rated health was not related to mortality. After covariates at the most recent observation and covariates measured only at baseline were controlled for, the most recent self-rated health was not associated with mortality either. After time-dependent covariates and covariates measured only at baseline were adjusted for, decline in self-rated health was significantly associated with increased mortality. Implications:\\u2002Change in self-rated health is a stronger predictor of mortality than self-rated health at baseline and at the most recent observation. Older women with “fair” health are worse off if they are on a declining health trajectory than if their “fair” health is stable. Family caregivers and clinicians need to closely monitor change in self-rated health among disabled older women. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to cross-sectionally and longitudinally identify risk factors for falls, fear of falling, and falls efficacy in late-middle-aged African Americans. Design and Methods: We performed in-home assessments on a probability sample of 998 African Americans and conducted two annual follow-up interviews. Multiple logistic regression modeled the associations with falls (any fall or injurious fall) during 2 years prior to the baseline interview, and baseline fear of falling and falls efficacy with 2-year prospective risks for falling and fear of falling. Results: The most consistent association for all outcomes was depressive symptoms. Age was associated with increased risk of prior and prospective falls. Lower-body functional limitations were associated with prior falls, baseline fear of falling, and low falls efficacy, whereas low ability with one-leg stands prospectively predicted fear of falling. The greatest prospective risk for incident falls was having had a prior fall (odds ratio = 2.51), and the greatest prospective risk for fear of falling was having been afraid of falling at baseline (odds ratio = 8.14). Implications: Falls, fear of falling, and low falls efficacy are important issues for late-middle-aged as well as older persons. Interventions should focus on younger adults and attend especially to lower-body function and depressive symptoms as well as building self-efficacy for safe exercise, dealing with falls risks, and managing falls themselves. Purpose: This study presents an analysis of the influence of consumers\\' predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics on the utilization of long-term care (LTC) services in nursing facilities (NFs), assisted living facilities, or home- and community-based services (HCBS). Design and Methods: Data were gathered through a record review of a cross-sectional sample of 1,968 consumers aged 60 years or older receiving formal LTC services. Results: Need contributes the most to differential LTC use. Those with the most need are more likely to be in a NF or HCBS. Enabling characteristics such as Medicaid eligibility and geopolitical region of the state were associated with higher use of NFs. Predisposing and enabling characteristics had a moderating influence on need. Implications:Although high need predicts care in NFs, some of the most impaired elders are also being cared for at home. Because Medicaid increases the likelihood of NF placement, public financing of LTC should reflect the capacity of the system to serve elders at home. Purpose: This analysis describes media coverage of long-term care in 1998. Design and Methods: Several sources were used to place coverage of long-term care in 1998 in the context of recent years and other health issues. For the primary analysis, stories in which long-term care was a major topic were collected from Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe. Media sources included major newspapers, network news, CNN, and NPR. Stories were coded for topic, details about the topic, physical placement within the overall coverage, and underlying issues. Results: A small percentage of media coverage in 1998 concerned long-term care. Among long-term care topics, nursing homes received the most coverage. A small percentage of long-term care topics were reported on the front page, and few underlying issues framed these topics. Implications:To ensure that Americans receive a comprehensive view of long-term care issues, gerontologists must work with reporters to influence how they report on long-term care. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the sociodemographics, self-rated health, and involvement levels of family caregivers of residents with dementia in residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) versus nursing home settings. Design and Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with the family caregivers most involved with 353 residents of 34 residential care and 10 nursing home facilities. We measured involvement by caregiver self-report of monthly out-of-pocket spending, involvement and burden ratings, and the frequency of engaging in eight specific care activities. Open-ended questions elicited areas in which caregivers preferred different involvement and ways the facility could facilitate involvement. Results: Nursing home caregivers rated their health poorer than RC/AL caregivers, but there were no sociodemographic differences between the two. RC/AL caregivers rated both their perception of involvement and burden higher and engaged more frequently in monitoring the resident\\'s health, well-being, and finances than did nursing home caregivers, although the reported time spent per week on care did not differ. Implications: RC/AL and nursing home caregivers to residents with dementia may tailor their care to fit the needs of the resident and setting. Results are discussed in relation to the Congruence Model of Person-Environment Fit. Purpose: This study adapts the Stress Process Model (SPM) of family caregiving to examine the predictors of depression in a sample of caregivers (n = 133) with demented relatives residing in suburban skilled nursing facilities. Design and Methods: We interviewed family caregivers of family members residing in skilled nursing homes using a variety of measures to assess primary stressors, secondary strain, nursing home stressors, and caregiver depression. We used block-wise regression analyses to determine the predictors of caregiver de-pression. Results: Results indicated that positive resident adjustment to placement was best predicted by the closeness of the resident–caregiver relationship and nursing home stressors. Caregiver strain, resident adjustment, and nursing home stressors best predicted caregiver adjustment. In turn, the best predictors of caregiver depression included caregiver age, caregiver adjustment to the nursing home, and nursing home stressors. Implications:These results suggest that caregiver depression is closely linked to how well both the resident and caregiver adjust to the nursing home environment. Results also indicate that by broadening the SPM to include stressors common to the nursing home experience, researchers will be able to understand more clearly the specific components of the stress process that may lead to depression in family caregivers of persons living in nursing homes. Purpose:Prior research in nursing homes has shown that cognitive impairment may reduce self-reported pain, but this relation has not been systematically explored among hospice patients. The assessment and treatment of pain is a primary goal of hospice care, and both disease processes and the use of opioid analgesics may lead to cognitive impairment among hospice patients. However, little is known about how cognitive functioning may impact the self-report of pain or the report of care recipient pain by family caregivers. Design and Methods:We explored the associations between pain, cognitive functioning, and gender among cancer patients and their family caregivers (N = 176 dyads) during in-home hospice care. This was a cross-sectional, correlational study. Results:Contrary to expectation, care recipients with cognitive impairment reported more intense pain than care recipients with intact cognitive functioning. However, cognitive impairment among care recipients had no impact on the pain report of family caregivers. Care recipient cognitive impairment was related to greater discrepancy in the pain reports of caregivers and care recipients. No gender differences in pain intensity report were found. Implications:Measurement issues and implications for assessing self-reported pain among hospice cancer patients with impaired cognitive functioning and the report of care recipient pain by family caregivers are discussed. Specifically, hospice staff must educate family caregivers regarding the potential impact of care recipient cognitive impairment on pain reports in order to facilitate accurate pain assessment and management. Purpose: Retirement is often treated as a voluntary transition, yet selected circumstances can restrict choice in retirement decision processes. We investigated conditions under which retirees perceive their retirement as “forced” rather than “wanted.” Methods: Analyses relied on Waves 1–4 of the Health and Retirement Survey (N = 1,160; 572 men and 588 women). Logistic regression models estimated the effects of background factors, choice and restricted choice conditions, and retirement contexts on perceptions of forced retirement. Results: Nearly one third of older workers perceived their retirement as forced. Such forced retirement reflects restricted choice through health limitations, job displacement, and care obligations. Other predictors include marital status, race, assets, benefits, job tenure, and off-time retirement. Implications: Future research should establish personal and policy implications of forced retirement. Programs are needed to help older workers forced into retirement find alternative employment opportunities and to reduce the conditions leading to forced retirement. Purpose: Nursing facilities with nurse practitioners or physician assistants (NPs or PAs) have been reported to provide better care to residents. Assuming that freestanding nursing homes in urban areas that employ these professionals are making an investment in medical infrastructure, we test the hypotheses that facilities in states with higher Medicaid rates, and those in more competitive markets and markets with higher managed care penetration, are more likely to employ NPs or PAs. Design and Methods: The Online Survey Certification and Reporting System (OSCAR) database, Area Resource File, and information from surveys of state policies from 1993 to 2002 are used to study the employment of NPs or PAs, using a cross-sectional time-series generalized estimating equation model with surveys nested within facilities, testing several market and state-policy effects while controlling for facility and market characteristics. Results: Throughout the 1990s the proportion of nursing facilities with NPs or PAs doubled, from less than 10% to over 20%. Facilities in states in the upper quartile of Medicaid reimbursement rates were 10% more likely to employ NPs or PAs. Facilities in more competitive markets, and in markets with higher managed care penetration, were more likely to employ NPs or PAs (adjusted odds ratio = 1.27, 1.20 respectively). Implications: More generous state Medicaid nursing home reimbursement and higher competition may advance the investment in medical infrastructure, which in turn may positively affect the quality of care provided to nursing home residents. Purpose:\\u2002This study had two goals: (a) to assess the validity of the Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) staffing data by comparing them to staffing measures from audited Medicaid Cost Reports and (b) to identify systematic differences between facilities that over-report or underreport staffing in the OSCAR.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We merged the 2002 Texas Nursing Facility Cost Report, the OSCAR for Texas facilities surveyed in 2002, and the 2003 Area Resource File. We eliminated outliers in the OSCAR using three decision rules, resulting in a final sample size of 941 of the total of 1,017 non-hospital-based facilities. We compared OSCAR and Medicaid Cost Report staffing measures for three staff types. We examined differences between facilities that over-reported or underreported staffing levels in the OSCAR by using logistic regression.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Average staffing levels were higher in the OSCAR than in the Medicaid Cost Report data. The two sets of measures exhibited correlations ranging between 0.5 and 0.6. For-profit and larger facilities consistently over-reported registered nurse staffing levels. Factors associated with increased odds of over-reporting licensed vocational nursing or certified nursing assistant staffing were lower Medicare or Medicaid censuses and less market competition. Facility characteristics associated with over-reporting were consistent across different levels of over-reporting. Underreporting was much less prevalent.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Certain types of facilities consistently over-report staffing levels. These reporting errors will affect the validity of consumer information systems, regulatory activities, and health services research results, particularly research using OSCAR data to examine the relationship between staffing and quality. Results call for a more accurate reporting system. Purpose: The purpose of this report is to provide basic descriptive information on community-dwelling, disabled, private long-term care (LTC) insurance policyholders who have accessed policy benefits. We focus on how benefits are used, whether claimants feel they are getting appropriate value from their policies, and what the patterns are of formal and informal service use. Design and Methods: Data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 693 LTC insurance claimants who were receiving benefits while living in the community and 424 of their informal caregivers. Eight of the largest LTC insurance companies representing about 80% of the market participated in the study. Results: LTC insurance benefits are well targeted; they serve those truly dependent on ongoing care. The vast majority of claimants are satisfied with their policies, understand their coverage, and find it easy to file claims. Because of their LTC benefits, substantial numbers of disabled elderly individuals report that they are able to remain at home instead of being forced to seek institutional care. The availability of LTC benefits reduces stress among informal caregivers. For most claimants, formal care did not replace informal caregiving. Implications: As the LTC insurance market continues to grow and mature, there will be changes in the profile of claimants, the service delivery system, and the design of policies. Expansions in the private market will be associated with a greater number of disabled elderly remaining in their homes with a maintenance of and enhanced resiliency of informal support networks. Purpose:\\u2003Valuation of life (VOL) represents a construct capturing active attachment to life put forward by M. P. Lawton (e.g., 1999). As old and very old individuals may differ in terms of endorsement and with respect to what makes a life worth living, the present study investigated whether mean levels and the explanatory value of sociodemographic, social, and health predictors for VOL differ between young-old and old-old individuals.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We presented a sample of 356 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 to 94 years with Lawton\\'s Positive Valuation of Life Scale and established measures to assess predictors of VOL.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Mean levels of VOL decreased from the third to the fourth age. Zero-order correlations showed significant relations between sociodemographic (i.e., age, gender, marital status, education), social (i.e., social contacts, phone calls, volunteering, contact with youth), and health (i.e., mobility, vision, hearing, activity restrictions, activity of daily living [ADL], instrumental ADL [IADL]) indicators. Regression analyses for the domain-specific predictors reduced the number of significant predictors to age, education, grandchildren, vision, and IADLs. When combining all sets of predictors, health explained twice as much variance in VOL compared to social indicators; sociodemographic indicators including age made no independent contribution. Separate analysis for young-old and old-old participants revealed age-differential prediction patterns. For the young-old, the role of health factors was especially strong, whereas specific social factors became more important in the old-old group.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Age-differential predictive values of the resources seem to indicate positive adaptation to aging. Taking into account such prediction patterns may help to design specific interventions for young-old and old-old individuals. Purpose: This paper reports on Canadian research that examined the cost effectiveness of home care for seniors as a substitute for long-term institutional services. Design and Methods: Two Canadian cities were included in the research: Victoria, British Columbia, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. The research computes the costs of formal care and informal care in both settings and ensures comparable groups of clients in both settings by comparing individuals at the same level of care. Results: The results reveal that costs were significantly lower for community clients than for facility clients, regardless of whether costs only to the government were taken into account or whether both formal and informal costs were taken into account. When informal caregiver time is valued at either minimum wage or replacement wage, there was a substantial jump in the average annual costs for both community and facility clients relative to when informal caregiver time was valued at zero. Implications: Nevertheless, the results reveal that home care is significantly less costly than residential care even when informal caregiver time is valued at replacement wage. Purpose: We sought to determine whether participants in the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) with an informal caregiver have a higher or lower risk of nursing home admission than those without caregivers. Design and Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis of 3,189 participants aged 55 years or older who were enrolled in 11 PACE programs during the period from June 1, 1990 through June 30, 1998. Cox proportional hazard models determined whether having any caregiver, as well as specific caregiver characteristics, such as either living separately from the enrollee, being over the age of 75 years, providing personal care, not reducing or quitting work to provide care, or not being a spouse, predicted time to nursing home admission. Results: Fewer than half of the participants (49.4%) lived with a caregiver, and 12.4% had no caregiver. Individuals who lived with their caregiver were frailer than either those who lived separately or those without a caregiver. We measured frailty in terms of functional and cognitive status, incontinence, and multiple behavioral disturbances. The presence of a caregiver did not change the risk for institutionalization. None of the caregiver characteristics were associated with a higher risk of nursing home admission. Implications: Unlike individuals in the general population, participants in PACE who lack an informal caregiver are not at higher risk of institutionalization. Further research is required to ascertain whether PACE\\'s comprehensive formal services compensate for the lack of informal caregiving in limiting the risk for institutionalization. Purpose:I examined health and long-term care use trajectories of a sample of chronically disabled older women eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid by exploring their use data in order to understand and anticipate the increasing demand on the health and long-term care delivery systems as aging female baby boomers reach age 65 and older. Design and Methods: A sample of older disabled women in Ohio who completed preadmission review was divided into three groups on the basis of the setting in which they received their initial long-term care services. Results: I was able to establish a long-term care career for the sample members beginning with receiving long-term care in the community, followed by a transition stage in which care was received in the community and in a nursing home, and finally by a stage at which they entered and remained in a nursing home. As the sample members proceeded along their long-term care career and their health and disability status worsened, I found a clear shift in the kind of care needed from hospital and home care to nursing home care. There was also a shift in the major payer, from Medicare to Medicaid. Implications: As the baby boomers age, a much larger number of women will be disabled and need health and long-term care services. For a considerable number of these women, Medicaid gradually becomes the major payer for care, an issue that needs close observation. Nursing home medical-record documentation of daily-care occurrence may be inaccurate, and information is not documented about important quality-of-life domains. The inadequacy of medical record data creates a barrier to improving care quality, because it supports an illusion of care consistent with regulations, which reduces the motivation and ability of providers to identify areas for improvement. Observational protocols designed for use by survey and quality-assurance staff can provide the independent information necessary for improving both medical record accuracy and residents\\' quality of life. Unfortunately, observational protocols currently used in survey and quality-assurance activities are not designed in a manner that is consistent with the scientific principles that guide observational measurement. The purpose of this article is to describe the steps to develop a standardized and scientifically defensible observational system to assess nursing home care quality. Purpose:\\u2002This study determined the prevalence of grandparents raising grandchildren who are living in rental housing and explored the sociodemographic characteristics and challenges faced by such renters. Design and Methods:\\u2002Data were obtained from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, a nationally representative survey of 700,000 households with a response rate of 96.8%. Frequencies and bivariate analyses were focused on the 2,639 respondents who were grandparent caregiver renters.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 2,350,000 grandparent caregivers in the United States in 2000, 26% were renters, almost one third of whom were spending 30% or more of their income on rent. For the quarter of a million grandparent caregiver renters living below the poverty line, 60% were spending at least 30% of their household income on rent and 3 of 10 were living in overcrowded conditions.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Grandparent caregivers who are renters represent a particularly vulnerable population. The need for further research, policy, and programs for this group is discussed. Purpose: This study examines gender differences in spousal caregiver stress associated with care-recipient problem behaviors and helping behaviors. Design and Methods: Using data from the National Long-Term Care Survey, we examined bivariate and multivariate relationships between the behaviors of care recipients and the stress experienced by their spouses. Results: Gender differences in caregiver stress emerged with respect to problem behaviors and helping behaviors of the care recipient. Helping behaviors had a moderating effect on the relationship between care-recipient problem behaviors and stress for caregiving husbands, but not for caregiving wives. Implications: As practitioners attempt to reduce spousal caregiving distress, they should assess the extent to which care recipient\\'s problem behaviors and efforts to be helpful contribute to caregiver stress. The continued undertreatment of pain at the end of life is a substantive public health problem that has not been resolved through increased public awareness, the issuance of clinical guidance for providers, or expanded organizational commitments. In this forum, we illuminate the role of public policies in promoting pain management. We review federal and state policies and consider empirical evaluations that compared the quality of state policies and the factors that contributed to their formation. We resolve that any organized interest in improving end-of-life care should begin by focusing on the development and expansion of those state policies that support the provision of evidence-based medicine for reducing the amount of pain an individual experiences at the end of life. Although empirical research is needed to determine which particular aspects of state pain policy are most critical and how these policies can be implemented most effectively, any organized effort that advances state medical board activity or another state policy would appear to be making an important step toward making the pain at the end of life go away. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to explore how medical care is delivered to older people in assisted living (AL) settings and to suggest ways for improving it.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We present a review of the limited research available on health care for older AL residents and on building testable models of better ways to organize primary health care and other health services for AL residents.\\u2003Results:\\u2002AL residents are frequently frail older persons who need good chronic care. The predominant care models today do not respond adequately to this challenge. Medical care for AL residents is currently practiced very much like that for persons living in the community. The potential for using the aggregation of patients has not been effectively tapped. We review some managed care models from other elements of long-term care to look for ways that might be adapted. However, the current funding approach emphasizes living settings rather than inherent client characteristics.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A research agenda might include ways to improve communication between AL and medical providers and to get AL staff more actively involved in daily care. Research support might produce the data necessary to entice the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services into changing its current reimbursement policies to create a climate better suited to delivering good chronic disease care in AL facilities. Purpose: This research examined whether the frequencies of specific emotions are associated with major and minor depression in older primary care patients. Design and Methods: Older primary care patients (N = 146), prescreened with a depression questionnaire, completed a diagnostic interview and an emotions questionnaire. Results: Controlling for age, sex, and other psychiatric and medical illnesses, major depressives differed from nondepressed controls in nine emotions; minor depressives differed from controls in four emotions. Major depressives differed from the controls more in sadness, joy, and interest—but not anger, fear, or guilt—than in comparison sets of emotions. Minor depressives differed from the controls more in sadness and inner-directed hostility—but not guilt, anger, fear, joy, or interest—than in comparison sets of emotions. Implications: The frequencies of discrete emotions are differentially associated with major and minor depression; future research is needed to determine their specific diagnostic and treatment implications. Purpose: This study examined the unique contribution of key existential factors to the prediction of psychological well-being of older adults following spousal loss. Design and Method: A number of measures to assess psychological well-being, sociodemographic standing, social resources, and religious and spiritual resources were administered to a volunteer sample of widows and widowers to test the hypothesis that existential factors such as personal meaning, religiosity, and spirituality are more potent predictors of psychological well-being than are previously hypothesized variables of sociodemographic, social support, and physical factors. Results: A hierarchical regression analysis of the data supported the hypothesis that existential factors are major contributors to psychological well-being of older adults following spousal loss. Findings showed that widowers, compared to widows, scored lower on the measure of psychological well-being. Implications: Implications of the findings are discussed for practitioners working with bereaved spouses; suggestions for further research concerning bereavement and psychological well-being are made. Purpose: This article investigates the extent of multiple- role occupancy among midlife individuals in Britain in cross-section and over the life course, focusing on work and family commitments. The association between demographic and social factors and multiple-role obligations is also investigated. Design and Methods: The research is based on secondary analysis of the British Family and Working Lives Survey, which contains retrospective paid work, caregiving, and child coresidence histories. Results: The proportion of individuals in midlife (women aged 45–59 and men aged 45–64) who have multiple roles, in terms of paid work and consistent family care, at any one point in time is low (2%). This is primarily due to the relatively small proportion (7%) of people in this age group who are caring for a dependent. Being older, unmarried, and in poor health significantly reduces the number of roles held among men and women. Although the frequency of multiple role occupancy, and intensive multiple role occupancy, is low on a cross-sectional basis, a much higher proportion of individuals have ever occupied multiple roles over their life course (14%). Implications:The findings will inform debate on how policy can best aid those endeavouring to balance paid work, family life, and caring responsibilities. Purpose: This study examines the value of self-reported health (SRH) as an indicator of underlying health status in a developing country setting.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Logistic regression methods with adjustments for multistage sampling are used to examine the factors associated with SRH in 2,921 men and women aged 50 and older in rural Bangladesh.\\u2003Results:\\u2002SRH incorporates multiple dimensions of health status (including physical disability assessed by measured physical performance; self-reported limitations in activities of daily living, or ADLs; self-reported chronic morbidity; and self-reported acute morbidity), severity, comorbidity, and trajectory in a similar fashion for both men and women and for different age groups. Older individuals are more likely to report poor SRH than their younger counterparts, and women report significantly worse SRH than their male peers at each age group. In both cases, this disadvantage can be fully accounted for by differences in measured physical performance, ADL limitations, and chronic and acute morbidity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Among older Bangladeshis, SRH is an easily recorded, multifaceted, nuanced indicator of underlying health status that is significantly associated with measured physical performance. Moreover, SRH appears to be independent of age- and gender-related norms. Purpose: This study addressed well-being of grandmothers raising grandchildren in coparenting and custodial households in a sample of African American, Latino, and White grandmothers. Design and Methods: A sample of 1,058 grandmothers was recruited through the schools and media. Grandmothers raising or helping to raise school-aged grandchildren in Los Angeles were interviewed, and analyses were conducted within ethnic groups. Results: African American grandmothers experienced equal well-being in coparenting and custodial families; however, if the stresses related to the parents\\' problems were removed by statistical control, they favored the custodial arrangement. Latino grandmothers had greater well-being in coparenting families, reflecting a tradition of intergenerational living. White custodial grandmothers experienced somewhat higher levels of affect (positive and negative) but showed no difference in other types of well-being. Implications: The cultural lens through which grandparenthood is viewed has a marked impact on the adaptation to custodial or coparenting family structures. Purpose:\\u2002We compared a primary-care-based psychotherapy, that is, problem-solving therapy for primary care (PST-PC), to community-based psychotherapy in treating late-life major depression and dysthymia.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The data here are from the IMPACT study, which compared collaborative care within a primary care clinic to care as usual in the treatment of 1,801 primary care patients, 60 years of age or older, with major depression or dysthymia. This study is a secondary data analysis (n = 433) of participants who received either PST-PC (by means of collaborative care) or community-based psychotherapy (by means of usual care).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Older adults who received PST-PC had more depression-free days at both 12 and between 12 and 24 months (β = 47.5, p <.001; β = 47.0, p <.001), and they had fewer depressive symptoms and better functioning at 12 months (βdep = −0.36, p <.001; βfunc = −0.94, p <.001), than those who received community-based psychotherapy. We found no differences at 24 months.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Results suggest that PST-PC as delivered in primary care settings is an effective method for treating late-life depression. Purpose:\\u2002We estimated the effect of a voucher benefit on the demand for personal assistance by Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older who had functional disabilities. Design and Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis on 645 Medicare beneficiaries from the Medicare Primary and Consumer-Directed Care Demonstration (a randomized controlled trial) between August 1998 and June 2000. We estimated a two-part model to determine the effect of the voucher on out-of-pocket personal assistance expenditures. The model controlled for individual health and functional status variables, sociodemographics, prior health care utilization, and state fixed effects. Results: A modest experimental Medicare personal assistance voucher benefit (that reimbursed 80% of up to $250 of eligible expenses per month) increased the likelihood of any out-of-pocket spending for assistance (by 12%, p <.05), but it did not increase the amount of personal assistance expenditures among users (p =.94). Overall, the voucher benefits increased average annual expenditures by 10% ($5,304 for the voucher group vs $4,836 for the control group). However, this effect did not reach statistical significance (p =.66). Implications: The voucher benefit provided a small incentive to use personal assistance for older Medicare beneficiaries with functional disabilities. Thus, if Medicare were to implement such a benefit, Medicare expenditures may increase. Further research is needed to determine if the increased personal assistance use leads to better health outcomes and whether it is associated with offset cost savings for Medicare-covered services. Purpose:\\u2002Many older adults have inadequate health-related literacy, which is associated with poor health outcomes. Thus, it is important to identify determinants of health literacy. We investigated relationships between health literacy and general cognitive and sensory abilities, as well as education, health, and demographic variables, in a community sample of middle-aged and older adults.\\u2003 Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants were 314 community-dwelling adults (67% female, 48% African American) diagnosed with chronic heart failure recruited for a pharmacist-based intervention study to improve adherence to chronic heart failure medications. We adminstered demographic, health, education, cognitive (e.g., processing speed, working memory), and sensory measures, and the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), as part of the baseline condition of this study.\\u2003Results: STOFHLA scores were lower for participants who were older, less educated, male, African American, had more comorbidities, or scored lower on all cognitive ability measures. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that education and cognitive ability were independently associated with the STOFHLA measure and explained age differences in health literacy.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The association of cognitive abilities and literacy has important implications for health literacy models and for interventions to reduce the impact of low health literacy on health outcomes. For example, medication instructions should be designed to reduce comprehension demands on general cognitive abilities as well as literacy skills. This article describes a pay-for-performance system developed for Minnesota nursing homes. In effect, nursing homes can retain a greater proportion of the difference between their costs and the average costs on the basis of their quality scores. The quality score is a derived and weighted composite measure currently composed of five elements: staff retention (25 points), staff turnover (15 points), use of pool staff (10 points), nursing home quality indicators (40 points), and survey deficiencies (10 points). Information on residents\\' quality of life and satisfaction, derived from interviews with a random sample of residents in each Minnesota nursing home, is now available for inclusion in the quality measure. The new payment system was designed to create a business case for quality when used in addition to a nursing home report card that uses the same quality elements to inform potential consumers about the quality of nursing homes. Although the nursing home industry has announced general support for the new approach, it has lobbied the legislature to delay its implementation, claiming concerns about operational details. Purpose:This article identifies challenges in defining, measuring, and studying quality of life of nursing home residents.Design and Method:A theoretical analysis was conducted based on literature and the author\\'s own large-scale studies of quality of life of nursing home residents.Results:Measuring quality of life is a relatively low priority in nursing homes because of focus on markers of poor quality of care, pervasive sense that nursing homes are powerless to influence quality of life, and impatience with research among those dedicated to culture change. The research argues that the resident voice must be sought in reaching operational definitions for quality of life and as reporters on the quality of their own lives, and that resident burden is a spurious concern that should not deter direct interviews with residents. Five challenges in measuring quality of life were identified: (a) designing questions with appropriate response categories and time frames, (b) developing a sampling strategy, (c) aggregating information at the individual and facility level, (d) validating what are ultimately subjective constructs, and (e) developing an approach using observations and proxies to assess quality of life for approximately the 40% of the residents who will be impossible to interview.Implications:Although residents\\' perceived quality of life is partly a product of their health, social supports, and personalities, nursing homes can directly influence quality of life through their polices, practices, and environments, and, indirectly, through their approaches to family and community. A research agenda is needed, which includes both methodological research and studies of the correlates of quality of life. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to describe the work of evening and night home care patrols in Swedish old-age care by examining how staff members view their work and the specific work content.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The authors developed two questionnaires: one that was to be answered jointly by the patrol teams, and one to be completed by each individual member of a team. All patrols in the municipality of Jönköping, Sweden, were asked to participate.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The most frequent kind of help provided by evening and night patrols involves personal care, but help with medications and injections are also frequent. The staff reported that it is becoming more common for the patrols to assist people with terminal illnesses. The patrols also increasingly assist people with psychiatric problems. The staff feels that the job may be becoming too diverse and that they need further education for the range of tasks they are asked to perform.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The patrols are very flexible in the services provided. Without the patrols, the staff members believe that many persons would have to leave their homes to go to institutions. Purpose:\\u2002Emphasis on consumer-centered care for frail and institutionalized older adults has increased the development and adaptation of surveys for this population. Conventional methods used to pretest survey items fail to investigate underlying sources of measurement error. However, the use of the cognitive interview (CI), a method for studying how respondents answer survey items, is not well established or documented in this population. This study demonstrates how CIs can be used to improve questionnaires intended for nursing home residents.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002CIs were conducted with 29 nursing home residents in order to identify potential problems with prospective survey items. We used scripted probes to standardize the interviews and adapted the Question Appraisal System to enumerate and classify the problems discovered.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We fielded between one and five versions of each item in an iterative process that identified 61 item-specific problems. Additionally, residents\\' cognitive responses suggested that some screened their answers on the basis of perceived physical and environmental limitations, and some had difficulty answering items about preferences that fluctuate day to day. These findings led us to modify the items and response set to simplify the respondents\\' cognitive task.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study illustrates how CI techniques can be used to understand residents\\' comprehension of and response to survey items. Purpose:\\u2002To better understand the experiences and potential unmet need of persons who die in long-term care.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted after-death interviews with staff who had cared for 422 decedents with dementia and 159 who were cognitively intact and received terminal care in U.S. nursing homes (NHs) or residential care–assisted living (RC-AL) settings. We conducted family caregiver interviews for 293 decedents.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We noted no differences between decedents with and without dementia in terms of pain, psychosocial status, family involvement, advance care planning, most life-prolonging interventions, and hospice use. Dying residents with dementia tended to die less often in a hospital, have less shortness of breath, receive more physical restraints and sedative medication, and use emergency services less frequently on the last day of life. Persons with dementia dying in RC-AL settings tended to have more skin ulcers and poorer hygiene care than nondemented persons in RC-AL settings. In comparison with persons dying with dementia in NHs, those in RC-AL settings tended to be restrained less often, have emergency services called more often on the day of death, and have family more satisfied with physician communication.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These results suggest that the overall quality of care for persons dying with dementia in long-term-care settings may not differ markedly from that provided to persons who are cognitively intact. Similarly, large discrepancies in the overall quality of palliative care for persons with dementia in RC-AL facilities and NHs were not identified. However, numerous specific areas for care improvement were noted. Since the early 1980s, service providers and area agencies on aging, that is, the aging network, have developed a number of strengths as they built a community-based long-term-care system in most states. Many area agencies and providers now have the capacity to assess the needs of older persons, identify appropriate services, and administer cost-effective community programs while operating within fixed, capped budgets. They have also been able to identify and maintain roles for informal caregivers, draw on community resources through donations and the use of volunteers, and create substantial political support. In this article we argue that the aging network should draw on these strengths to develop integrated long-term-care systems designed to shift the balance of state long-term-care systems from institutional to home- and community-based services. We also argue that the nonprofit aging network, because it is made up of area agencies on aging and service providers, provides a potentially more effective framework for the integration of long-term-care resources than do proprietary managed care organizations. Purpose: States are increasingly using the Medicaid 1915c waiver program to provide community-based long-term care. A substantially greater share of long-term-care dollars supports community-based care for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, relative to older and working-age persons with primarily physical disabilities. Design and Methods: We used state-level data for the period from 1992 to 2001 to estimate fixed-effects panel models. We compared state predictors of waiver utilization and expenditures for waivers serving both older and working-age individuals (O/WAIs) relative to waivers serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Results: We found community-based-care capacity to predict use and expenditures for both target groups. Although regulation of institutional supply was positively related to expenditure measures for IDDs, it was not related to use or expenditures for O/WAIs. Demand variables (e.g., the size of a state\\'s African American population) predicted use and expenditures for IDD waivers, but they were less consistent for O/WAI waivers. State resources were a robust predictor of use and expenditures for both groups. Implications: Increased community-based-care capacity appears to be an important factor in efforts to expand the availability of Medicaid community-based care. Federal policies that address state resource issues may also spur growth in community-based long-term care. Purpose:\\u2002The majority of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are cared for at home by a family member such as a spouse or daughter. Caregiving places enormous demands on these caregivers, and the negative consequences associated with caregiving are well documented. This paper reports results from the Miami site of the REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\\'s Caregiver Health) program that examined the efficacy of a family therapy and technology-based intervention in reducing depressive symptoms (according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale) among family caregivers of AD patients at 6 months and 18 months follow-up.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002There were 225 White American and Cuban American caregivers that were randomized into a structural ecosystems therapy, structural ecosystems therapy + computer–telephone integrated system, or minimal support control condition.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Caregivers in the combined family therapy and technology intervention experienced a significant reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 months. The 18-month follow-up data indicated that the intervention was particularly beneficial for Cuban American husband and daughter caregivers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results indicate that information technology has a promising role in alleviating distress and depression among groups of AD caregivers. The data also demonstrate that interventions have differential impacts according to ethnic group and the caregiver–patient relationship. Purpose: This study examined commonalities and differences in the experiences and challenges of White, Black, and Hispanic informal caregivers in New York, NY. Design and Methods: A randomly selected representative cross-section of 2,241 households was contacted through telephone interviews. Complete data were available for 380 eligible participants, who were classified as White (n = 164), Black (n = 129) and Hispanic (n = 87). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences in caregiving intensity, reported difficulty with providing care, and having unmet needs with care provision. Results: Over 70% of caregivers had no help from formal caregivers, even though over 80% had been providing care for at least 1 year, and 40% had been providing this care for 20 or more hr per week. Compared with White caregivers, Black caregivers were more likely to provide higher intensity care, to report having unmet needs with care provision, and to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers, but were less likely to report difficulty with providing care. Hispanic caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to have help from formal caregivers and to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers. Implications: Although many similarities exist in the experiences and challenges of informal caregivers, gaining insight from different populations of family caregivers would help program planners, policy makers, and formal caregivers to develop and implement culturally sensitive programs and policies that are supportive of the needs of these caregivers in their ever-expanding roles. Future efforts also should focus on exploring the potentially significant role that community resources, in particular, religious institutions, could play in providing outreach and support to racial/ethnic minority caregivers. Purpose: This study explored the psychosocial dynamics of short hospice stays (less than 2 weeks) of cancer patients age 65 and older. Design and Methods: In-depth interviews with 59 caregivers of 50 patients were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded by using Atlas ti software. Results: A descriptive typology is presented. A late diagnosis (n = 22 or 44%) was one in which cancer was diagnosed between 2 and 4 weeks before death, rendering earlier hospice admission impossible. Late diagnoses were made because the cancer was missed, masked by comorbidities, or the person resisted seeing a health care provider. A known diagnosis (n = 25 or 50%) was one in which the diagnosis was made long before hospice admission; admission was delayed because the person elected ongoing curative treatment until the final days of life, or the family managed the care without hospice until a turning point (medical, functional, pragmatic, or emotional) occurred, making the care unmanageable. Implications: Hospice utilization is influenced by the interrelationship among patient–family–provider factors. Understanding the characteristics and needs of subgroups of terminally ill people is key to providing good care at life\\'s end. Purpose:\\u2002This demonstration evaluates the effects of integrating Alzheimer\\'s Association care consultation service with health care services offered by a large managed care system. The primary hypothesis is that Association care consultation will decrease service utilization, increase satisfaction with managed care, and decrease caregiver depression and care-related strain. Secondary modifying-effects hypotheses posit that the effects of the intervention will be intensified when patients have not received a firm dementia diagnosis, patients have more severe memory problems, caregivers use other Association services in tandem with care consultation, and caregivers are not patients\\' spouses.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The demonstration is a randomized trial that examines outcomes after a 12-month study period. Interview data from 157 primary family caregivers are combined with data abstracted from medical/administrative records.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Support for the primary hypothesis is found for selected, but not all, service utilization outcomes and for caregiver depression. Support for secondary modifying-effects hypotheses is found for satisfaction outcomes and care-related strain outcomes.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Care consultation delivered within a partnership between a managed care health system and an Alzheimer\\'s Association is a promising strategy for improving selected outcomes for patients with dementia and their caregivers. Purpose: This study described person–environment (P–E) fit and activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults, and it explored the relationship between P–E fit and ADL dependence, testing Lawton\\'s docility hypothesis at two points in time. Design and Methods: From a random sample of individuals aged 75–84 living in a Swedish municipality, 72 persons were available for baseline and follow-up interviews over a 6-year period. Interviews and observations were used for data collection at home visits. Results: P–E fit problems as well as ADL dependence increased from baseline to follow-up. Functional limitations and dependence on mobility devices increased; few changes were found concerning environmental barriers. At follow-up, ADL dependence and P–E fit correlated significantly in the frailest subsample. Implications: In advanced age, P–E fit problems in housing are related to ADL dependence. The increase of P–E fit problems mostly results from functional decline, although to some extent it is from environmental changes as well. The methodology used demonstrates the potential to increase our understanding of how the main components of Lawton\\'s model change and interact over time. Purpose:\\u2002This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Dyadic Relationship Scale (DRS), which measures negative and positive dyadic interactions from the perspective of both the patient and the family caregiver. An important aspect of evaluating the DRS was that it be statistically sound and meaningful for both members of the dyad.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study used a cross-sectional design. Survey packages were mailed to home health care patients and their family caregivers. The unit of analysis was the dyad, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. We examined the reliability, discriminant, and concurrent validities of the instrument.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The data supported a two-factor DRS that included negative dyadic strain (patient α =.84; caregiver α =.89) and positive dyadic interaction (patient α =.86; caregiver α =.85). The analysis supported the DRS\\'s construct, discriminant, and concurrent validity, as well as its reliability for both patients and family caregivers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Using the DRS to measure the impact of family care on positive and negative interactions inclusive of patients and caregivers can assist in identifying areas of difficulty and guide interventions to improve outcomes for both members of the dyad. Purpose: Pathological gambling is an increasing public health concern, but very little is known about this disorder in older adults. This study evaluated gambling and psychosocial problems across age groups in treatment-seeking gamblers. Design and Methods: At intake to gambling treatment programs, 343 pathological gamblers completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and gambling questionnaires. Participants were categorized by age into young adults (ages 18–35 years; n = 97), middle-aged adults (ages 36–55 years, n = 197), and older adults (aged older than 55 years, n = 49). Differences in demographics, gambling variables, and ASI composite scores were compared across the groups. Results: The middle- and older age gamblers were more likely to be female (45%–55%) than were the younger gamblers (23%), but the groups were similar with respect to most other demographic variables. When controlled for gender, older age was associated with increased employment problems, but fewer social, legal, and substance-abuse difficulties. Compared with middle-aged gamblers, older gamblers wagered on fewer days. Age × Gender effects emerged in onset of gambling problems and amount spent gambling. Older women did not begin gambling regularly until an average age of 55 years, whereas older male gamblers generally reported a lifelong history of gambling. The older female gamblers also wagered the greatest amounts in the month prior to treat-ment entry. Implications: These data suggest that older adults compose a minority of treatment-seeking gamblers, but differences in psychosocial problems across the age groups may suggest the need for interventions tailored to particular issues encountered by older pathological gamblers. Specifically, treatments focusing on later life development of problems may be indicated for older female gamblers. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to investigate pain management among 42 hospice and 65 non-hospice residents in two proprietary nursing homes. Design and Methods:In this prospective, anthropological, quantitative, and qualitative study, we used participant observation, event analysis, and chart review to obtain data. The Medication Quantification Scale was used in order to account for the prescription and administration of all analgesic medications. Results:Although 72% of residents experienced pain, we found no statistically significant differences in the proportion of hospice versus non-hospice residents (a) who had been prescribed opioids and co-analgesics, and (b) whose medication was administered around the clock or as needed. Limited physician availability, lack of pharmacologic knowledge, and limitations of nursing staff hindered pain management of both groups of residents. Implications:Although hospice care is of some benefit, pain management and high-quality end-of-life care is dependent upon the context in which it is provided. Given that between 1991 and 2001 Medicare expenditures for nursing home-based hospice care increased from $8.6 million to $21.8 million, the effectiveness of hospice-care programs in nursing homes warrants further study. Purpose: Using the life stress model of psychological well-being, in this study we examined risks and resources predicting the occurrence of both positive and negative affect among older Asian Indian immigrants who experienced stressful life events. Design and Methods: We collected data through a telephone survey of 226 respondents (aged 50 years and older) in the Southeastern United States. We used hierarchical, negative binomial regression analyses to examine correlates of positive and negative affect. Results: Different coping resources influenced positive and negative affect when stressful life events were controlled for. Being female was a common risk factor for poorer positive and increased negative affect. Satisfaction with friendships and a cultural or ethnic identity that is either bicultural or more American were predictive of greater positive affect. Greater religiosity and increased mastery were resources predicting less negative affect. Implications: Cognitive and structural interventions that increase opportunities for social integration, increasing mastery, and addressing spiritual concerns are discussed as ways of coping with stress to improve the well-being of individuals in this immigrant community. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article was to investigate the role of control beliefs in mediating the relationship between driving cessation and change in depressive symptoms in a population-based sample of older adults.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We report results from a prospective, community-based cohort study that included two waves of data collected in 1992 and 1994. Participants consisted of 700 men and women aged 70 and older, including 647 drivers and 53 participants who ceased driving between baseline (1992) and follow-up (1994). Participants took part in interviews that included assessments of driving status, sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, sensory function, depressive symptoms (through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale), and expectancy of control. Using multilevel general linear models, we examined the extent to which driving status, expectancy of control, and relevant covariates explained change in depressive-symptom scores between baseline and follow-up.&!ensp;Results:\\u2002Driving cessation was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up. The higher depressive-symptom scores of ceased drivers relative to those of individuals who remained drivers at both waves was partly explained by a corresponding decrease in the sense of control among ceased drivers, and increased control beliefs among drivers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Interventions aimed at promoting the maintenance of personal agency and associated control beliefs could be protective against the negative psychological concomitants of driving cessation. Purpose: We investigated whether community consultants could be trained to teach family caregivers a systematic behavioral approach for reducing mood and behavior problems in persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Design and Methods: This study consisted of a randomized controlled trial; we randomly assigned 95 family caregivers and care recipients with Alzheimer\\'s disease to STAR-caregivers (STAR-C) or control groups. Masked interviewers conducted assessments at baseline, after treatment, and after 6 months. Consultants were master\\'s-level health care professionals who were currently practicing in community settings serving older adults. We assessed the extent to which consultants were able to learn and adhere to the treatment protocol, and the relationship between adherence and measures of caregiver mood, burden, and care recipient mood and behavior. Results: Community consultants were able to learn and adhere to the behavioral treatment protocol. Caregivers receiving STAR-C training showed significant improvements in depression, burden, and reactivity to behavior problems in the care recipient. There were also significant reductions in the frequency and severity of care recipient behavior problems, and improved quality of life. Results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Implications: Community-based consultants successfully implemented a behavioral intervention with family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Consequently, STAR-C seems to be a practicable and reasonable evidenced-based approach to caregiver training in actual clinical settings. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the prevalence rating of depression in nursing homes as flagged on the Minimum Data Set (MDS) quality indicator report. Design and Methods: Research Staff measured depression symptoms and compared the results with the prevalence of disturbed mood symptoms documented by nursing home (NH) staff on the MDS in two samples of residents living in different NHs. The homes had been flagged on the nationally mandated MDS quality indicator report as having unusually low (Site 1) or high (Site 2) prevalence rates of depression. Results: The percentages of residents determined by research staff interview assessments to have probable depression in the two resident samples were not significantly different (49% vs. 55%, respectively) between homes. The staff in the home flagged on the MDS quality indicator report as having a high depression prevalence rate identified significantly more residents who also had scores indicative of probable depression on the resident interviews for follow-up mood assessments than did the home with a low quality indicator prevalence rate (78% vs. 25%, respectively). Implications: The prevalence of the depression quality indicator may be more reflective of measurement processes than of depression outcomes. Factors that may affect the difference in detection rates are discussed. This article provides a framework for understanding how long-term care (LTC) research contributes to policy, develops a typology of research contributions to policy with examples of each type, and suggests ways to ensure that contributions continue in the future. The article draws on in-depth interviews with LTC experts working at the interface between research and policy, as well as a small, informal Internet survey and the relevant political science and health policy literature. LTC research makes important contributions to policy, but its contributions easily go unrecognized because they are subtle and often depend on research investments made many years before policy is affected. Thus, it is important to consider what investments in LTC research initiatives and infrastructure are needed to ensure the future contributions of research to policy and to identify barriers to funding such investments. A number of steps that researchers can take to enhance the future contribution of research to LTC policy are proposed. The following abstracts were accepted for presentation at the 56th Annual Scientific Meeting of The Gerontological Society of America, November 21–25, 2003, in San Diego, California, and were omitted from The Gerontologist, Volume 43, Special Issues I and II, October 2003. Purpose: The goal of this project was to examine the factors related to the high level of voter turnout among older adults and how these factors have changed across the past 50 years. The study builds on previous research efforts by combining individual level analyses from three nationally representative surveys. Design and Methods: We examined voter turnout among older citizens using the American National Election Studies (ANES) 1952–1996, the Current Population Studies (CPS) 1972–1996, and the General Social Surveys (GSS) 1972–1996. Logit regression identified significant factors that contribute to or detract from voting in presidential elections. Results: Included in the extensive results, we found that being married, attending church, and contact by political operatives (since the 1980 election) contributed positively to older voters\\' turnout, whereas living in the South was a negative predictor. Implications: Triangulating data sources, we are able to utilize the strengths of each study—providing an overview of the determinants of voter turnout and understanding of the changes related to older Americans\\' turnout in presidential elections. Purpose: This study examines older patient preferences for psychological services, including the types of services they would be interested in and who should provide them. Design and Methods: We surveyed 183 primary care patients aged 55 and older on their current level of psychiatric distress and preferences for psychological services. Results: Seventy-nine percent of this sample said they would use any of the psychological services we presented to them. Seventy-two percent preferred to talk to their primary care provider, and 46% of the sample indicated that they would also speak with a mental health worker or nurse about their problems. Few older people said they would attend group psychotherapy, but 69% said they would attend psychoeducational classes. Implications: Our findings suggest that older adults would be amenable to psychosocial services, particularly individual services and psychoeducational programming. Policy makers interested in improving the quality of mental health treatment in primary care medicine should consider the inclusion of psychological services as a treatment option. Purpose:\\u2002Drawing from stress and coping models, we examined heterogeneity in the expression of familism (i.e., beliefs about the caregiving role) and its impact on psychological distress among African American women caregivers.\\u2003Design and Methods:We relied on data from the Black Rural and Urban Caregivers Mental Health and Functioning study, a cross-sectional study of 521 midwestern African American women family caregivers. First we used the ordinary least squares regression method to examine the factors predicting caregiving beliefs. Subsequently, using hierarchical linear regressions, we regressed caregivers\\' depressive symptoms and perceived stress on their familism beliefs while controlling separately for interpersonal, personal, and situational contextual factors. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Wife caregivers, caregivers with lower levels of education, and caregivers with lower levels of mastery held significantly more traditional caregiving beliefs. Also, having poor caregiving relationships; being younger; being unemployed; and having lower levels of education, self-rated health, and mastery were all associated with higher levels of depression and perceived stress in caregivers. Traditional caregiving beliefs were also significant predictors of higher levels of depression and perceived stress.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Although familism is culturally and socially popular, traditional beliefs in the caregiving role can lead to negative psychological consequences for African American women caregivers. Policies that support the realistic involvement of caregivers are needed to prevent negative consequences for caregivers. Purpose:\\u2002This study explored the quality and functioning of terminally ill elders\\' social relationships and their impact on elders\\' consideration to hasten death.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 96 terminally ill elders. Logistic regression was used to determine whether aspects of social relationships significantly predicted the consideration to hasten death. The qualitative data was content analyzed to identify main themes and patterns.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Logistic regression revealed that conflictual social support was a significant predictor of the consideration to hasten death. Qualitative data provided insight into findings that responsibilities to loved ones or direct verbal attempts did not deter elders\\' consideration to hasten death.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This research highlights the importance of quality social support in elders\\' consideration to hasten death and exhibits the need for practitioners to assess thoroughly the quality of elder–caregiver relations. Purpose: The goals of this review are to synthesize what is known about caregiving among diverse groups and to identify gaps in knowledge to guide future research on caregiving. The review focuses on conceptual and theoretical approaches, sampling strategies, measurement techniques, and similarities and differences found among groups and across studies. Design and Methods: A narrative approach was used to review 59 articles published between 1980 and 2000, with particular attention to race, ethnicity, and/or culture. Primary sources of relevant articles included electronic databases, other review articles, and reference lists. Results: Caregiving experiences and outcomes varied across racial and ethnic groups. However, the use of nontheoretical approaches, nonprobability samples, and inconsistent measures among studies has limited understanding of caregiving among diverse populations. Implications: It is important that conceptualization and theorizing broaden with increasing numbers of studies that include diverse groups. Future caregiving research needs to give more attention to such issues as acculturation, assimilation, and cultural values, beliefs, and norms, while also improving theoretical and methodological rigor. Purpose: We assess the effects of racial or ethnic concordance between caregivers and interventionists on caregiver attrition, change in depression, and change in burden in a multisite randomized clinical trial. Design and Methods: Family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease were randomized to intervention or control groups at six sites from 1996 to 2000. Interventionists provided psychosocial interventions aimed at decreasing caregiver depression and burden. This analysis included 694 caregivers who received face-to-face interventions from 36 interventionists at five sites. We modeled caregiver loss to follow-up at 12 months and changes in depression and burden from baseline by racial or ethnic concordance by using random effects logistic and linear regression models, controlling for caregiver age, gender, race or ethnicity, relation to care recipient, interventionist race or ethnicity, and care recipient activities of daily living. The loss to follow-up model also controlled for care recipient institutionalization and death. Results: Overall, there was no difference in caregiver loss to follow-up or change in depression or burden by racial or ethnic concordance. African-American caregivers with an interventionist of the same race or ethnicity had greater decreases in depression than did African-American caregivers with interventionists of a different race or ethnicity. However, this finding has to be interpreted cautiously because there were only two African-American interventionists. Implications: Although these initial findings do not provide conclusive evidence on whether racial or ethnic concordance is associated with intervention outcomes for caregivers of Alzheimer\\'s disease patients, these results, along with the paucity of research studies evaluating this issue, suggest that the effects of racial or ethnic concordance in research should be systematically examined in future studies. Purpose:\\u2002Retirees in traditional pension plans must generally choose between single life annuities, which provide regular payments until death, and joint and survivor annuities, which pay less each month but continue to make payments to the spouse after the death of the retired worker. This article examines the payout decision and measures the share of married retirees with pension annuities who forego survivor protection.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The analysis consists of a probit model of the pension payout decision, based on data from the 1992–2000 waves of the Health and Retirement Study.\\u2003Results:\\u2002More than one quarter (28%) of married men and two thirds of married women receiving employer-sponsored retirement annuities declined survivor protection. Men with small pensions and limited household wealth, men in better health than their spouses, and men whose spouses have pension coverage from their own employers are more likely than other men to reject survivor protection.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Most workers appear to make payout decisions by rationally balancing the costs and benefits of each type of annuity, suggesting that existing measures to encourage joint and survivor annuities are adequate. However, the growth in 401(k) plans, which are generally not covered by existing laws protecting spousal pension rights, may leave widows vulnerable. Purpose: We assess the effect of consumer-directed care on the emotional, physical, and financial well-being of the primary informal caregivers of the Medicaid beneficiaries who voluntarily joined Arkansas\\'s Cash and Counseling demonstration. Design and Methods: The demonstration randomly assigned beneficiaries to a program in which they could direct their own disability-related supportive services (the treatment group) or rely on traditional agency services (the control group). We constructed outcome measures from telephone interviews with 1,433 caregivers who provided beneficiaries with the most unpaid assistance at baseline, and we used multivariate regression models to estimate program effects. Interviews occurred between February 2000 and April 2002, 10 months after beneficiaries\\' random assignment. Results: At follow-up, treatment group caregivers provided fewer hours of assistance than did their control group counterparts, on average, and they reported better emotional, physical, and financial well-being. Implications: Permitting interested Medicaid beneficiaries to direct their own in-home supportive services reduces burden on informal caregivers, which may help reduce beneficiaries\\' nursing home use. One third of older adults fall each year, placing them at risk for serious injury, functional decline, and health care utilization. Despite the availability of effective preventive approaches, policy and clinical efforts at preventing falls among older adults have been limited. In this article we present the burden of falls, review evidence concerning the effectiveness of fall-prevention services, describe barriers for clinicians and for payers in promoting these services, and suggest strategies to encourage greater use of these services. The challenges are substantial, but strategies for incremental change are available while more broad-based changes in health care financing and clinical practice evolve to better manage the multiple chronic health conditions, including falls, experienced by older Americans. This article presents a brief screening tool to help case managers identify clients in a home- and community-based services (HCBS) program who need more intensive social work case management (CM). Using existing data from a case management time study (N = 242) and a content analysis of 70 cases in a Medicaid waiver–funded HCBS program, this study highlights a number of issues, such as dementia-related behavior problems, noncompliance with treatment, poor informal caregiver health and mental health, and a conflicted or problematic relationship between client and caregiver, which are useful in predicting need for intensive case management. Kappas for interrater reliability and t tests for discriminant validity show these items to be reliable and valid. This tool will allow for better allocation of CM resources in terms of case manager time and type of expertise needed to address these issues. Purpose: Although several studies have examined the magnitude and prevalence of Medicaid estate planning (MEP), little is known about factors that influence individual behaviors in this area. Normative data regarding public perceptions of and motivations for MEP are nonexistent. This study explored views about MEP among community-dwelling older adults and family caregivers. Design and methods: Eighteen focus groups were completed (N = 155), with a stratified homogeneous sample to ensure representation from individuals of varying race/ethnicity, experience with nursing home and home care services, and socioeconomic status. Analyses of transcripts were completed with NUD*IST 4.0 software. Results: Disincentives for MEP included losing control of one\\'s assets, Medicaid stigma, and perceived immorality of MEP. Incentives for MEP included preservation of one\\'s estate and protection of a spouse. Finally, variability in accessibility to and awareness of MEP was described. Implications: This exploratory study identifies motivations for individual behaviors and describes evolving social norms regarding MEP; implications for policy and research are discussed. Purpose:\\u2002We describe an approach to identifying knowledge gaps, research questions, and methodological issues for assisted living (AL) research.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We undertook an inventory of AL literature and research in progress and commissioned background papers critiquing knowledge on selected subtopics. With an advisory committee, we identified a comprehensive list of researchable questions of potential utility to consumers, providers, and/or policy makers, which AL researchers then rated as to their importance. The preliminary work facilitated a structured working conference of AL researchers.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The top five priority topics identified as a result of the polling before the conference were consumer preferences, cost and financing, developing an information system for consumer decision making, developing quality measures, and resident outcomes. From conference discussion, conferees added other emphasis areas and refined the original ones. They flagged lack of standardized definitions and measures as barriers to building an empirically based AL literature. Conferees also identified distinctions between research on AL as a whole and research on interventions within AL.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002In an emerging area in which the literature cannot yet support rigorous comparisons, meta-analysis, or consensus conferences, the systematic approaches, including assembling researchers who use widely different methods, generated substantial agreement on a research agenda. Purpose:\\u2002Research concerned with the relationship between volunteer activity and psychological well-being has typically reported higher levels of well-being among older adult volunteers relative to nonvolunteers. However, few studies have examined nonlinear associations between frequency of volunteer activity and well-being. We examined nonlinear associations between hours spent volunteering and psychological well-being, controlling for employment status, partner status, physical health, and education. We also investigated associations between different domains of volunteer activity and well-being, along with the possible moderating effects of gender on these relationships.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used data from the PATH Through Life Project, a population-based study of Australian adults. Participants consisted of 2,136 older adults aged 64 to 68. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Nonlinear associations between hours spent volunteering and psychological well-being were evident, with these associations characterized by inverted U shapes, with nonvolunteers and those volunteering at high levels producing lower well-being scores relative to those volunteering at moderate levels. Few associations between specific domains of volunteer activity and well-being were evident, and no notable gender interactions emerged.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results point toward optimal frequency of engagement in volunteer activity for psychological well-being as being bounded by upper and lower levels, outside of which benefits to well-being diminish. Purpose. Our objectives are to present a conceptual model of the pain assessment process in persons with dementia and discuss methods for validating our model within this population. Design and Methods. This conceptual work is based on an integrative review and current pain theory, pain assessment research in demented and nondemented populations, and research on the science of self-report. Results. We present a multidimensional model of pain assessment that emphasizes the role of the external rater. Our model posits that a nociceptive stimulus leads to pain sensation, followed by pain perception, followed by the exhibition of external signs of pain by the patient, followed by an external rater\\'s observation and interpretation of those external signs. Further, the model specifies the effects of nociceptive stimulus factors on pain sensation; patient-specific factors on pain perception; method-specific factors on external sign observation; and rater-specific factors on external sign interpretation. Implications. Pain assessment in persons with dementia must go beyond a unidimensional model of pain assessment. This multidimensional model also directly addresses the challenges of using external ratings to assess pain in persons with dementia. Finally, we present clinical recommendations for applying the model to pain assessment endeavors and research recommendations for evaluating models of pain in this population. This article describes care for behavioral symptoms related to dementia (BSRD) and identifies their potential correlates among 347 residents with dementia living in 45 assisted living facilities and nursing homes from four states. The prevalence of BSRD was associated with staff training and resident cognition, mood, mobility, and psychotropic use. Attention to staff training and depression management might improve BSRD. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine if simply providing nursing facilities with comparative quality performance information and education about quality improvement would improve clinical practices and subsequently improve resident outcomes, or if a stronger inter-vention, expert clinical consultation with nursing facility staff, is needed. Design and Methods: Nursing facilities (n = 113) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: workshop and feedback reports only, workshop and feedback reports with clinical consultation, and control. Minimum Data Set (MDS) Quality Indicator (QI) feedback reports were prepared and sent quarterly to each facility in intervention groups for a year. Clinical consultation by a gerontological clinical nurse specialist (GCNS) was offered to those in the second group. Results: With the exception of MDS QI 27 (little or no activity), no significant differences in resident assessment measures were detected between the groups of facilities. However, outcomes of residents in nursing homes that actually took advantage of the clinical consultation of the GCNS demonstrated trends in improvements in QIs measuring falls, behavioral symptoms, little or no activity, and pressure ulcers (overall and for low-risk residents). Implications: Simply providing comparative performance feedback is not enough to improve resident outcomes. It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly. Purpose:\\u2002This study concerns one component of the ability to provide person-centered care: the cognitive skill of perceiving others in relatively complex terms. This study tested the effectiveness of a social motivation for increasing the number of psychological constructs used to describe an unfamiliar senior citizen.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Forty-four certified nurse aide students participated. Students were mostly 30-year-old (M = 31) females (86%) with a high school education (72%). A quasi-experimental design was used. Early in training, participants completed the Role Category Questionnaire (RCQ), which measured their interpersonal cognitive complexity. On the basis of their RCQ scores, participants were matched and assigned to the experimental or control condition. Five weeks later, participants viewed a 15-min videotaped biography of an unfamiliar senior citizen—Mitch. Participants in both conditions were told they would be asked to describe Mitch as a person after watching the video. Only participants in the experimental condition were additionally asked to imagine that they would be having a personal conversation with him afterward.\\u2003Results:\\u2002As hypothesized, participants in the experimental condition (M = 14.6) used more constructs to describe Mitch than did participants in the control condition (M = 11.8): F(1, 41) = 4.03, p <.05. Participants\\' RCQ scores were significantly correlated with the complexity of their descriptions of Mitch.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings suggest that new training materials should be created that include experienced certified nurse aides\\' modeling how biographical and personal information can be used in caregiving tasks to gain residents\\' cooperation. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and results of ascertaining Medicare enrollees\\' priorities for insured medical benefits. Design and Methods: Structured group exercises were conducted with Medicare enrollees from clinical and community settings in central North Carolina. By participating in a decision exercise, CHAT: Choosing Healthplans All Together, individuals and groups chose medical benefits within the constraints of a monthly Medicare + Choice premium. The acceptability of the exercise and the resulting benefit package were assessed. Results: Ten groups (121 individuals) made trade-offs that involved the selection of more tightly managed care in order to add pharmacy, dental, and long-term care benefits. All were willing to forgo experimental therapy; 7 groups gave priority to insuring the uninsured. Participants found the exercise overwhelmingly acceptable and were willing to abide by their groups\\' choices. Implications: Medicare enrollees are able to come to consensus about financially constrained benefit packages that may be useful in reform of the Medicare program. Purpose:We conducted this study to determine whether neuropsychiatric symptoms and environmental characteristics are associated with quality of life in assisted living residents with dementia.Design and Methods:We used a cross-sectional study of 134 residents from 22 facilities and employed the Alzheimer\\'s Disease-Related Quality of Life Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. A scale was developed to capture the homelike climate of each facility. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the relationship of neuropsychiatric symptoms and homelike climate with quality of life, controlling for sociodemographics, cognition, functional dependence, and physical health. Exploratory analyses and graphical techniques were employed to test for environmental-level moderating effects.Results:Agitation, depression, apathy, and irritability were significant predictors of quality of life, explaining 29% of the variance. Neither facility size nor homelike environment was significantly associated with quality of life in univariate analyses. Size of facility moderated the relationship between agitation and quality of life.Implications:Neuropsychiatric symptoms impair quality of life in residents with dementia. Further research should investigate the role of other environmental aspects. Purpose: Barriers to family involvement in the nursing home with the potential for change through intervention are examined, including transportation, caregiver health, relationships with staff, and resident characteristics. Design and Methods: Data were collected for 93 family caregiver–resident pairs by means of telephone interviews and chart review. Regression modeling was used to identify relationships between involvement (caregiver visit frequency) and the changeable barriers after the known variables of distance, kinship, payment source, length of stay, and cognitive function were taken into account. Results: Lower visit frequency was found for caregivers reporting problems with transportation, poor relationships with staff, and a smaller network of supportive family and friends. Higher caregiver anxiety was related to higher visit frequency. Implications: Several barriers to family involvement are shown to be as or more influential than ones identified in previous research, thus providing empirical support for interventions currently used as well as suggesting new areas for intervention. Purpose: This study examined the association between turnover of caregivers and turnover of nursing home top management. The top managers examined were administrators and directors of nursing, and the caregivers examined were registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nurse aides. Design and Methods: The data came from a survey of 419 nursing facilities and the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting system. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between turnover of nursing home top management and turnover of caregivers. Results: A 10% increase in top management turnover is associated (p <.05) with a 21% increase in the odds that a facility will have a high turnover rate of nurse aides and is associated (p <.05) with an 8% decrease in the odds that a facility will have a low turnover rate of nurse aides. A 10% increase in top management turnover is associated (p <.1) with a 30% increase in the odds that a facility will have a high turnover rate for registered and licensed practical nurses. Implications: This study provides preliminary evidence that the turnover of top managers may have an important influence on caregiver turnover in nursing homes. Purpose: To examine demographic characteristics and work conditions of home care aides, nursing home aides, and hospital aides in the late 1980s and late 1990s. Design and Methods: This study replicated a previous study which examined the Current Population Survey (CPS) March supplement from 1987 to 1989. The present study examined CPS data from 1997 to 1999 both to obtain a profile of aides in the late 1990s and to compare 1990\\'s work conditions and demographic characteristics with those of aides in the late 1980s. Results: Whereas demographic characteristics and work conditions of hospital and nursing home aides show little change over the decade, home care aides today are generally younger, more educated, more likely to hold full-time positions, and more likely to have health benefits than their counterparts 10 years ago. Yet work conditions are still poorer for home care aides than for the other types of aides. Implications: Work conditions need further improvement, particularly for home care aides. More accurate data to describe paraprofessional care workers are also necessary to address the serious worker shortage problems. Purpose:\\u2002The primary goal of the Care-Receiver Efficacy Intervention (CREI) was to increase the capacity of cognitively able elderly care receivers to effectively manage their own care and optimize relationships with caregivers. To accomplish this, two forms of the CREI were created: an individual and a small-group form. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of these two CREI forms when compared to a case management approach.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, between January 2002 and August 2004 we collected data from 177 elders at three time points: pretest, 2 months following the last session, and 12 months following the last session. The Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale and the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale–Revised were the outcome measures.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We found significant effects favoring the CREI for relationship with caregivers, self-care strategies, loneliness, and quality of life. Effects were strongest for the small-group form of the CREI. Overall, the care receivers in both forms of the CREI showed improved self-performance, with small-group CREI participants showing remarkable improvement related to quality of life.\\u2003Implications: The results of this research suggest that care receiver intervention can be effective in improving the care process. Purpose: We propose national standards previously recommended for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program by an Institute of Medicine program evaluation committee, and introduce a tool to measure the compliance of local ombudsman programs to those standards: the Huber Badrak Borders Scales. Methods: The best practices for ombudsman programs detailed in the committee\\'s report were adapted to 43 Likert-type scales that were then averaged into 10 infrastructure component scales: (a) program structure, (b) qualifications of local ombudsmen, (c) legal authority, (d) financial resources, (e) management information systems, (f) legal resources, (g) human resources, (h) resident advocacy services, (i) systemic advocacy, and (j) educational services. The scales were pilot-tested in 1996 and 1999 with Kentucky ombudsmen. Results: The means of 9 of these 10 scales were higher in 1999 than in 1996, suggesting that local ombudsman programs were more in compliance with the proposed standards in 1999 than three years earlier. Implications: The development process consisted of 10 adopt-test-revise-retest steps that can be replicated by other types of programs to develop program compliance tools. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare adults with and without dementia on capacities to consent to treatment as assessed by three instruments. Design and Methods: Eighty-eight older adults with mild to moderate dementia were compared with 88 matched controls on four indices of legal competency to consent to medical treatment as assessed with three capacity instruments. Results:Mean performance of adults with dementia on a legal standard of understanding treatment information was impaired relative to controls on all instruments, and it was also impaired for an appreciation standard on one instrument and a reasoning standard on two instruments. However, in categorical ratings, most adults with dementia were within the normal range on all decisional capacities. Legal standards were operationalized differently across the three instruments for the capacities of appreciation and reasoning. Implications: Most adults with mild dementia can participate in medical decision making as defined by legal standards, although memory impairments may limit demonstration of understanding of diagnostic and treatment information. In dementia, assessments of reasoning about treatment options should focus on whether a person can describe salient reasons for a specific choice, whereas assessments of appreciation of the meaning of diagnostic and treatment information should focus on whether a person can describe the implications of various choices for future states. More research is needed to establish the reliability and validity of assessment tools and of capacity constructs. Purpose of the Study: Researchers have posited a depletion syndrome among older adults that resembles \"depression without sadness.\" Disengagement-related theories such as socio-emotional selectivity and gerotranscendence also describe an adaptive narrowing of the older person\\'s social world and decreasing investment in activities and social relationships. This study has dual goals of confirming the existence of a \"Withdrawal/Apathy/[Lack of] Vigor\" (WAV) dimension of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and exploring its properties for evidence that it may be descriptive of either depletion or disengagement-related change in older adults. Design and Methods: Data were obtained through a mailed survey of members 65 and older at a health maintenance organization. Respondents returned 327 completed surveys and 163 \"decline\" postcards. Principal-components analysis obtained a 6-item WAV factor for further analyses. Results and Implications: High endorsement rates for the items in WAV and its bivariate correlations with age and health problems suggest WAV may be congruent with disengagement or depletion and may lead to over-identification of depression in older adults. Interpretation of the GDS and similar measures may be improved by use of subscale scores and consideration of age and health status of the respondent. The purpose of this article is to stimulate discussion and research about patient suffering and caregiver compassion. It is our view that these constructs are central to understanding phenomena such as family caregiving, and that recognizing their unique role in the caregiving experience provides new directions for intervention research, clinical practices, and social policy. We first define and characterize these constructs, review empirical evidence supporting the distinct role of suffering and compassion in the context of caregiving, and then present a conceptual model linking patient suffering with caregiver compassion. We conclude with a discussion of implications and future directions for clinical intervention, research, and policy. Purpose:The Family Care Conference (FCC) is an elder-focused, family-centered, community-based intervention for the prevention and mitigation of elder abuse. It is based on a family conference intervention developed by the Maori people of New Zealand, who determined that Western European ways of working with child welfare issues were undermining such family values as the definition and meaning of family, the importance of spirituality, the use of ritual, and the value of noninterference. The FCC provides the opportunity for family members to come together to discuss and develop a plan for the well-being of their elders.Design and Methods:Using a community-based participatory research approach, investigators piloted and implemented the FCC in one northwestern Native American community. The delivery of the FCC intervention has grown from having been introduced and facilitated by the researchers, to training community members to facilitate the family meetings, to becoming incorporated into a Tribal agency, which will oversee the implementation of the FCC.Results:To date, families have accepted and appreciated the FCC intervention. The constructive approach of the FCC process helps to bring focus to families\\' concerns and aligns their efforts toward positive action.Implications:The strength-based FCC provides a culturally anchored and individualized means of identifying frail Native American elders\\' needs and finding solutions from family and available community resources. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined federal and state civil money penalties and fines collected from nursing homes and how states used the collected funds.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a telephone survey of state officials, Freedom of Information Act requests, state Web site searches, and stakeholder interviews to describe the funds collected, the availability and the use of funds, public information about penalties and fines, and the state allocation process and policies.\\u2003Results:\\u2002In 2004, 43 states collected a total of $21 million from more than 3,000 federal and state penalties and fines. Forty-two states had $60.5 million in fund accounts from penalties and fines available in 2005, and 32 states spent $28 million on a wide range of projects. Fifteen states spent $17.9 million on survey and certification activities, 19 states spent $5.6 million on provider projects, 6 states spent $1.3 million on advocacy projects, and 12 states spent $2.7 million for other projects. Most states did not provide information to the public about issuing penalties and fines, have formal procedures to inform stakeholders and allocate funds, or involve stakeholder groups in the decision-making process.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Funds from federal and state penalties and fines vary widely across states. These funds are a resource for improving the quality of nursing home care that needs more attention from policy makers and stakeholder groups. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined issues related to using older workers in frontline jobs in long-term care from employers\\' and prospective employees\\' perspectives.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Telephone surveys were conducted with employers representing 615 nursing homes and 410 home health agencies, and 1,091 low-income participants aged 40+ in Operation ABLE employment and training organizations. A total of 696 of these participants were 55 years or older.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Low-income older workers were interested in paraprofessional careers in long-term care. More were interested in home health care jobs than working in nursing homes. Job titles that most interested these workers were infrequent in nursing homes. Many workers perceived their health status as sufficient for frontline work. The majority was interested in career advancement opportunities and went to senior centers and places of worship to seek employment. Industry employers had many positive perceptions of older direct care workers, but there were real and perceived deterrents to hiring older workers. The most prominent deterrents were employers\\' perceptions that older workers have higher health care costs and are less willing to use technology.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Policy makers should target Title V funds toward training low-income older workers for long-term care jobs, particularly in using mechanical devices and long-term care technologies. Employment and training organizations should add coursework in long-term care technologies, learn about legal issues in targeting advertising to low-income older workers, and educate employers about ways to reach these prospective employees. Older workers can use information about employers\\' perceptions when seeking employment. Purpose: This article reviews the problems associated with recruiting older minorities into mental health research studies and proposes a consumer-centered model of research methodology that addresses the barriers to recruitment and retention in this population.\\u2003Design and Methods: The authors discuss and compare the results of recruitment and retention interventions for two geriatric mental health studies, one that used traditional methods of recruitment and retention and another that used consumer-centered methods.\\u2003Results: Although the consumer-centered methods result in better recruitment of older minorities in general (χ2 = 54.90, p <.001), it was not superior to the traditional method in recruiting older minorities (χ2 = 0.82, ns). However, the consumer-centered approach yielded better retention of older minorities (χ2 = 6.20, p <.05) than did the traditional method. Within both methods, recruitment through provider referral and face-to-face contact were the superior recruitment methods (χ2 = 6.78, p <.05). Having an experienced recruiter or a community recruiter resulted in greater agreement to participate than simply having an ethnically matched recruiter (χ2 = 36.00, p <.001).\\u2003Implications: Although these data are observational, and rigorous research on the best methods for recruiting and retaining older minorities is still necessary, the results suggest that a consumer-centered model of research yields greater overall recruitment and retention rates than do traditional research methods. Purpose:\\u2003We provide an overview of theoretical models of cognitive aging and present empirical research that uses these models to explain older patients\\' medical behaviors and to develop interventions for improving the delivery of health information and services to older adults.\\u2003Design and Methods: Theoretical accounts of age and cognition are summarized and are related to key research findings, including age differences in comprehension of medical information, adherence, and use of medical technologies. The implications of cognitive aging theories for designing optimal medical environments and enhancing adherence are discussed.\\u2003Results: Age declines in basic cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity limit older adults\\' ability to comprehend and recall several types of novel medical information. In contrast, automatic processes and environmental cues can benefit older adults, as shown by age increases in compliance for practiced or mentally imaged health behaviors, but can also be dangerous, as shown by older adults\\' greater belief in false but familiar health statements. Last, cognitive aging is shown to be a useful model for investigating cognitive disorders.\\u2003Implications: Cognitive aging theories are important for understanding older patient behaviors and suggest age-related declines as well as gains in performance in medical domains. In addition, models of cognitive aging are useful in guiding the development of interventions that improve health care in older patients and in furthering our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in populations other than older adults. Purpose:\\u2002To inform states with nursing home transition programs, we determine what risk factors are associated with participants\\' long-term readmission to nursing homes within 1 year after discharge.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We obtained administrative data for all 1,354 nursing home residents who were discharged, and we interviewed 628 transitioning through New Jersey\\'s nursing home transition program in 2000. We used the Andersen behavioral model to select predictors of long-term nursing home readmission, and we used Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine the relative risk of experiencing such readmissions. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, 72.6% of the 1,354 individuals remained in the community, with 8.6% readmitted to a nursing home for long stays (>90 days) and 18.8% dying during the study year. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that being male, single, and dissatisfied with one\\'s living situation; living with others; and falling within 8 to 10 weeks after discharge were significant predictors of long-term nursing home readmission during the first year after discharge.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Most of the factors predicting long-term readmission were predisposing, not need, factors. This fact points to the limits of formulaic approaches to assessing candidates for discharge and the importance of working with clients to understand and address their particular vulnerabilities. Consumers, state policy makers, nursing home transition staff, discharge planners, and caregivers can use these findings to understand and help clients understand their particular risks and options, and to identify those individuals needing the greatest attention during the transition period as well as risk-specific services such as fall-prevention programs that should be made available to them. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to estimate the effect of obesity on both the length of life and length of nondisabled life for older Americans. Design and Methods: Using data from the first 3 waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) survey, this article develops estimates of total, active, and disabled life expectancy for obese and nonobese older men and women. We used the Interpolation of Markov Chains (IMaCh) method to estimate the average number of years obese and nonobese older persons can expect to live with and without activity of daily living (ADL) disability. Results: Our findings indicate that obesity has little effect on life expectancy in adults aged 70 years and older. However, the obese are more likely to become disabled. This means that obese older adults live both more years and a higher proportion of their remaining lives disabled. Implications: The lack of significant differences in life expectancy by obesity status among the old suggests that obesity-related death is less of a concern than disability in this age range. Given steady increases in obesity among Americans at all ages, future disability rates may be higher than anticipated among older U.S. adults. In order to reduce disability among future cohorts of older adults, more research is needed on the causes and treatment of obesity and evaluations done on interventions to accomplish and maintain weight loss. Purpose: This study identifies the relative importance of reasons for institutionalization endorsed by caregivers of patients with dementia; examines the relationship between caregivers\\' reasons for institutionalization and indicators of caregiver and patient physical and emotional functioning measured in the prior year; and compares, on these indicators, caregivers who institutionalized their care recipients with caregivers who did not. Design and Methods: Participants were 2,200 caregivers from the National Longitudinal Caregiver Study, including 580 who institutionalized their care recipient during the 3-year interval. Caregivers\\' reason(s) for institutionalization were examined and correlated with indicators of caregiver and patient physical and emotional functioning. These indicators were used in a proportional hazards model to determine independent predictors. Results: Caregivers\\' reasons for placement included (a) the need for more skilled care (65%); (b) the caregivers\\' health (49%); (c) the patients\\' dementia-related behaviors (46%); and (d) the need for more assistance (23%). Each of these reasons was significantly associated with indicators in the prior year\\'s survey. This study uniquely demonstrates that caregiving task demand and a single-item measure of caregiver life satisfaction significantly predict placement. Implications: These findings emphasize that caregivers\\' reasons have valid underpinnings and that institutionalization of dementia patients results from caregiver and patient factors evident in the year prior to placement. In routine office visits, caregivers should be systematically screened; accounts of low life satisfaction, dementia problem behaviors, or high task demand should cue clinicians that discussions of nursing home placement would be timely and appropriate. Purpose: This study assessed self-reported pain in the oldest old and examined its changes over time and in relation to other measures of health and functioning. Design and Methods: A population-based sample of the oldest old (86–92 years of age) residing in Sweden who were participating in a multiwave longitudinal investigation were interviewed about their experience of pain, as well as other dimensions of health and functioning. Results: Prevalence of pain at baseline was 34% and rose to 40% at follow-up. Incidence of new pain cases during that period was 16 percent. Pain was significantly related to sleep difficulties, medication usage, global subjective health, depressive symptoms, and mobility, though the magnitude of the associations was relatively small. Implications: Our results extend previous cross-sectional findings by demonstrating there is both an increase in the proportion of people reporting pain over time after the age of 85 as well as the possibility of recovery. The modest strength of associations of pain with other areas of functioning suggests adaptation and selectivity among survivors in very late life. Purpose:\\u2002We examined the efficacy of an intervention tailored to the individual\\'s stage of change for exercise adoption on exercise stage of change, physical activity, and physical function in community-dwelling older adults.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We randomized participants to a print and telephone intervention or a contact comparison group. Through the use of longitudinal analyses we examined the intervention\\'s effectiveness in promoting stage progression, altering decisional balance and the processes of change, increasing self-efficacy and physical activity, and improving physical function among older adults who completed the 24-month study (N = 966). We conducted similar analyses that excluded individuals who were in maintenance at baseline and 24 months.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002At the end of the study, there were no differences in stage progression, self-efficacy, decisional balance, the processes of change, physical activity, or physical function by intervention assignment. When the analyses excluded those participants (n = 358) who were in the maintenance stage for exercise throughout the intervention, we found that, compared with the comparison group, a greater proportion of individuals who received the exercise intervention progressed in stage by 24 months. Conversely, more individuals in the comparison group remained stable or regressed in stage compared with the intervention group.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Results indicate that a tailored intervention is effective in increasing motivational readiness for exercise in individuals who were in stages of change other than maintenance. Purpose: This brief report takes a look at the preliminary estimates of the number and proportion of migrants over the age of 60 who moved to and from states between 1995 and 2000 and compares these estimates with those who made the same kind of move one decade earlier.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The 2000 census 1-in-100 public-use microdata sample, released in the summer of 2003, and the 1-in-20 sample from the 1990 census, were compared in this analysis. Point estimates of 100% were created for the inflows and outflows for the top 10 states in these two census decades. Net migration was also considered.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The total estimated number of older interstate migrants increased to over 2 million during the 1995–2000 migration period. Florida declined slightly in its position as the dominant destination for a second decade, indicating a downward trend for the first time. Arizona became the second largest receiving state, next to Florida, and California approached New York\\'s dominance as a migration origin, or sending, state. Nevada entered the top ranking retirement states for the first time.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Long-term migration dynamics of the older population may reflect perceived shifts in quality of life in destination states. Nonetheless, the next two decades will see a substantial rise in the number of older migrants. Purpose: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the determinants of death differ as a function of type of analysis in a representative sample of older African American and White people with comparable mortality rates. Design and Methods: Participants included all African American (n = 2,261) and White (n = 1,875) people at the Duke site of the Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly. Baseline information used to predict mortality 12 years later included demographic, health, and functional characteristics. Mortality (55% for African American people and 54% for White people) was determined through the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards models, logistic regression, and tree-based classification analysis were used (separately for African American and White people) to identify risk factors for mortality. Results: Risk factors for mortality were comparable, but the constellation of characteristics indicating higher risk for death differed between African American and White people. Implications: Proportional hazards and logistic regression identified risk factors in general; tree-based classification models identified the characteristics of groups at risk. The analysis used may influence the type and manner of intervention. Purpose:\\u2002We review what we currently know about older driver safety and mobility, and we highlight important research needs in a number of key areas that hold promise for achieving the safety and mobility goals for the aging baby boomers and future generations of older drivers.\\u2003Design and Methods:Through the use of a framework for transportation and safe mobility, we describe key areas of screening and assessment, remediation and rehabilitation, vehicle design and modification, technological advancements, roadway design, transitioning to nondriving, and alternative transportation to meet the goals of crash prevention and mobility maintenance for older adults. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Four cross-cutting themes emerged from this review: safe transportation for older adults is important; older adults have a variety of needs, abilities, and resources; research to help meet the transportation needs of older adults may be of benefit to persons with disabilities; and transportation issues concerning older adults are multifaceted.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Safe mobility is essential to continued engagement in civic, social, and community life, and to the human interactions necessary for health, well-being, and quality of life. When safe driving is no longer possible for older adults, safe and practicable alternative transportation must be available. Furthermore, older adults are individuals; they have specific needs, abilities, and resources. Not all older adults will have difficulty meeting their transportation needs and no single transportation solution will work for all people. Research and countermeasures intended to help meet the transportation needs of older adults will likely also benefit younger users of the transportation system, particularly those with disabilities. The issues surrounding the maintenance of safe transportation for older adults will require an interdisciplinary research approach if we are to make significant progress in the next decade as the baby boomers begin to reach age 70. Purpose:\\u2002To assess changes in various functional and satisfaction measures between older persons enrolled in Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO), a managed care program for older persons eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used two sets of matched controls for MSHO enrollees and their families and matched controls living in the community and in nursing homes: Persons in the same county who were eligible to enroll but did not enroll in MSHO and persons in other metropolitan areas where MSHO is not available. For the community sample, we used questionnaires to measure functional status (activities of daily living), pain, unmet care needs, satisfaction, and caregiver burden. Approximately 2 years after the first survey, we resurveyed respondents who lived in the community at the time of the first survey. For the nursing home residents, we used annual assessments to calculate case mix to compare changes in functional levels over time.\\u2003Results:\\u2002There were few significant differences in change over time between the MSHO sample and the two control groups. Out-of-area controls showed greater increases in pain but in-area controls showed less interference from pain. Compared with out-of-area controls, MSHO clients showed greater increase in homemaker use, meals on wheels, and outpatient rehabilitation. Compared with in-area controls, they showed more use of meals on wheels and less help from family with household tasks. There were few differences in satisfaction, but the MSHO families showed significantly lower burden than controls on five items.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The analyses show only modest evidence of benefit from MSHO compared with the two control groups. The model represented by MSHO does not appear to generate substantial differences in outcomes across function, satisfaction, and caregiver burden. Purpose: In response to concerns among policymakers and others that increases in the availability of publicly funded formal services will lead to reductions in self- and informal care, this study examines the relationship between the extent of formal in-home care received and levels of self- and informal care. Design and Methods: Two-stage least squares regression analyses were conducted, using data drawn from interviews conducted with a sample of 661 older users and nonusers of publicly subsidized home care services. Results: No evidence was found to indicate that more extensive use of formal services is associated with less extensive self- or informal care. This is true among those receiving publicly subsidized services as well as those required to pay part or all of the cost of the in-home services they receive. Implications: The findings provide little support for the substitution hypothesis that an increase in the use of formal in-home services will tend to erode levels of informal or self-care. Purpose:\\u2002Although the concept of successful aging is used widely in the field of gerontology, there is no agreed-on standard or common underlying definition for measuring success in aging. Our recent survey of an elderly male population asked respondents to define “successful aging.” This paper describes the themes that evolved from those definitions, explores interrelationships between the themes, and examines the association between characteristics of respondents and the themes provided in their definition. Design and Methods:\\u2002The Manitoba Follow-up Study has followed a cohort of 3,983 World War II Royal Canadian Air Force male aircrew recruits since July 1, 1948. At a mean age of 78 years in 1996, the survivors were surveyed and asked, “What is your definition of successful aging?” and “Would you say you have aged successfully?” A content analysis identified themes emerging from their definitions. Results:\\u2002The most frequent of the 20 component themes from the definitions of successful aging as provided by 30% of the 1,771 respondents related to “health and disease”; “physical,” “mental,” and “social activity” were more likely to be found in a definition including “interest,” “having goals,” “family,” or “diet,” and they were less likely to be mentioned with themes of “independence” or “health.” Many of the themes reflect an individual\\'s attitudes toward life and the aging process. Current life satisfaction, self-rated health, and limitation in activities of daily living were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of reporting specific themes in definitions.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002As health care professionals adapt to the changing demographic composition of society, it should be of interest to understand what successful aging might mean to the elderly males to whom they are attending. Purpose:\\u2002This study was designed to test the effectiveness and acceptance of multimedia home safety programming by community-dwelling seniors.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A prototype CD-ROM was produced that required no reading or computer skills because the program included an audio narration of content and directions for operating the program on a touchscreen computer monitor. Volunteers (N = 126) from a senior center aged 55 and older were randomly assigned to (1) a multimedia group that used the interactive program to learn about home safety, (2) a traditional learning group that read well-established booklets on home safety, and (3) a control group that received no instruction on safety between the pre- and posttests. Results:\\u2002Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance showed that the multimedia group was the only group to improve in knowledge. The group was also very satisfied with the approach.\\u2003Implications: Multimedia formats can effectively and economically provide information to older clients. Nursing home quality indicators have been developed over the past 10 years to quantify nursing home quality and to draw systematic comparisons between facilities. Although these indicators have been applied widely for nursing home regulation, quality improvement, and public reporting, researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about their accuracy and usefulness. We critically evaluate nursing home quality indicators from the standpoint of theory, measurement, and application, and we recommend strategies to make the indicators more valuable as quality assessment tools. We recommend that (a) more comprehensive quality indicators should be developed in conjunction with the new Minimum Data Set 3.0; (b) the validity and reliability of the indicators should be evaluated thoroughly with respect to both measurement and application; (c) statistical criteria should be incorporated explicitly into quality indicator scoring and outlier targeting; (d) the dimensionality and theoretical structure of the quality indicators should be carefully examined; (e) risk adjustment methods should be refined and broadened; and (f) quality indicator reporting systems should be strengthened and tailored to stakeholders\\' needs. Purpose: There is debate about the relative merits and costs of private versus shared bedrooms in nursing homes, particularly in light of the current efforts at creating both cost-efficient and person-centered care facilities. The purpose of this project was to explore the extent to which there is evidence-based information that supports the merits of three different bedroom configurations: traditional shared, enhanced shared, and private. Design and Methods: We developed a framework of four broad domains that were related to the different bedroom configurations: psychosocial, clinical, operational, and construction or building factors. Within each dimension, we identified individual factors through the literature, interviews, and focus groups, with the goal of determining the breadth, depth, and quality of evidence supporting the benefits of one configuration over another. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The vast majority of factors identified in this study, regardless of whether there was solid empirical data, information from the focus groups, or other anecdotal evidence, indicated better outcomes associated with private rooms over shared rooms in nursing homes. Cost estimates suggest that construction cost (plus debt service) differences range from roughly $20,506 per bed for a traditional shared room to $36,515 for a private one, and that such differences are recouped in less than 2 years if beds are occupied, and in less than 3 months if a shared bed remains unoccupied at average private-pay room costs. Implications: Despite limited empirical evidence in some areas, this project provides the foundation for an evidence-based life-cycle costing perspective regarding the relative merits of different bedroom configurations. Purpose: This study examined whether providing outcomes information to 120 nursing homes facilitated improvements in quality over a 12-month period, as compared with 1,171 facilities not receiving this information. The outcomes information provided consisted of a report mailed to administrators that examined six measures of care quality. These were the rates of physical restraint use, urethral catheterization, contractures, pressure ulcers, psychotropic medication use, and certification survey quality of care deficiencies. Design and Methods: Data used in this investigation came from the 1998 and 1999 On-line Survey, Certification and Recording (OSCAR) system. With the use of generalized least squares regression and each of the six quality indicators as dependent variables, risk-adjustment models were developed by using aggregate resident variables as independent variables. These risk-adjustment models were used to compare the outcome measures for the intervention facilities with the same outcome measures in other facilities in the same states (Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York, Texas, and South Dakota). The difference between 1998 predicted scores less actual scores was calculated, and the difference between 1999 predicted scores less actual scores for each facility was calculated. Subtracting these 1998 difference scores from the 1999 difference scores gives some indication of the change in outcomes controlling for resident mix. Results: Physical restraint use and psychotropic medication use were significantly lower after 12 months in the intervention facilities, suggesting that quality had improved. Implications: This study may provide evidence that some of the outcomes initiatives currently being pursued in the long-term care arena will positively affect quality of care. Purpose:The authors examine differences in reports of residual disability and unmet need by type of long-term care arrangement (assistive technology or personal care).Design and Methods:This study compares three specific dimensions of residual difficulty (pain, fatigue, and time intensity) and reports of unmet need across care arrangements. Samples from the U. S. 1994–1995 National Health Interview Survey Phase 2 Disability Supplements include adults with limitations in bathing, transferring, walking, and getting outside.Results:Even when differences in underlying disability are accounted for, assistive technology (AT) confers no additional benefit in the three dimensions of residual difficulty analyzed here. AT users equally or more often report that tasks are tiring, time consuming, or painful, even when they use assistance. Though this would appear to indicate unmet needs for care, fewer AT users report a desire for hands-on personal care.Implications:Though disability alleviation by technology is no better on specific dimensions of difficulty, technology users report less unmet need for personal care. Designing appropriate and cost-effective home care for adults with disabilities requires a better understanding of the ways in which technology users may differ from others and the circumstances under which technology can be most effective. Purpose: Several studies have previously documented the existence of a perception gap—the extent to which quality-of-life ratings provided by nursing home residents and caregivers diverge. In this study we use Helson\\'s adaptation-level theory to investigate three types of antecedents: (a) focal factors, (b) background factors, and (c) residual factors. Design and Methods: We calculated the perception gap for 11 quality-of-life domains. Caregivers rated both job satisfaction and their perception of quality of life of residents in the unit where they provided service. Concurrently, residents from these units completed quality-of-life interviews. We computed the perception gap by subtracting the residents\\' ratings from the caregivers\\' ratings for each quality-of-life domain. We conducted a hierarchical linear model using 3,850 observations to predict the perception gap. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Caregivers perceive quality of life to be lower than residents do across all domains fairly consistently. Caregiver demographics do not directly predict the perception gap. However, satisfaction with work, pay, and promotion were significant predictors (p <.05), and satisfaction with supervisor was a marginally significant predictor (p <.10), of the perception gap. As satisfaction with these job dimensions increased, the perception gap decreased. Additional models show that several caregiver demographics directly influence job-satisfaction dimensions, though they did not influence the perception gap. Implications: Job-satisfaction dimensions, rather than caregiver characteristics, are the appropriate predictors of the perception gap. However, caregiver demographics exert their influence indirectly by means of job satisfaction. A key finding is that higher job satisfaction leads to a smaller perception gap. Helson\\'s adaptation-level theory appears to be a useful approach for understanding the antecedents of the perception gap. Purpose: This study determined overall risk and predictors of long-term nursing home admission within the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). Design and Methods: DataPACE records for 4,646 participants aged 55 years or older who were enrolled in 12 Medicare- and Medicaid-capitated PACE programs during the period from June 1, 1990, to June 30, 1998, were obtained. Participants were enrolled for at least 30 days and had baseline evaluations within 30 days of enrollment. Cox proportional hazard models predicting an outcome of nursing home admission of 30 days or longer were estimated. Results: The cumulative risk of admission to nursing homes for 30 days or longer was 14.9% within 3 years. Individuals enrolled from a nursing home were at very high risk for future admission, with a relative risk of 5.20 when compared with those living alone. Among individuals enrolled in PACE from the community, age, instrumental activity of daily living dependence, and bowel incontinence were predictive of subsequent nursing home admission. Asians and Blacks had a lower risk of institutionalization than Whites. However, other characteristics were not independently predictive of institutionalization, namely poor cognitive status, number of chronic conditions, activity of daily living deficits, urinary incontinence, several behavioral disturbances, and duration of program operation. Before adjusting for other variables, there was substantial site variability in risk of nursing home admission; this decreased considerably after other characteristics were adjusted for. Implications: Despite the fact that 100% of the PACE participants were nursing home certifiable, the risk of being admitted to a nursing home long term following enrollment from the community is low. The presence of some reversible risk factors may have implications for early intervention to reduce risk further, although the effect of these interventions is likely to be modest. Individuals who received long-term care in a nursing home prior to enrollment in PACE remain at high risk of readmission, despite the availability of comprehensive services. Purpose:Washington State\\'s initiatives to increase the availability and quality of community residential care presented an opportunity to describe clients entering adult family homes, adult residential care, and assisted living and to identify outcomes of care. Design and Methods:We enrolled 349 residents, 243 informal caregivers, and 299 providers in 219 settings. We conducted interviews at enrollment and 12 months later, and we collected data from state databases.Results:The average resident was a 78yearold woman reporting dependence in two of six activities of daily living. Residents in adult family homes demonstrated significantly more disability. Seventy-eight percent of residents survived at the 12-month follow-up. In analyses that controlled for differences at enrollment, residents in the three types of settings were very similar in health outcomes at follow-up.Implications:State policies should reflect the wide range of needs of residents seeking care in these settings. Choices among type of setting can be based on the match of needs to individual preferences. Derived from Buddhism, mindfulness is a unique approach for understanding human suffering and happiness that has attracted rapidly growing interest among health care professionals. In this article I describe current thinking about the concept of mindfulness and elaborate on why and how mindfulness-based interventions have potential within the context of geriatric medicine and gerontology. Upon reviewing definitions and models of the concept, I give attention to the unique role that the body plays in cultivating mindfulness and the advantages that this focus has for older adults because they have aging biological systems and may experience chronic disease, pain, and disability. In the final section I discuss why mindfulness may be particularly useful in promoting physical activity among older adults and how physical activity may be used as a vehicle to promote mindfulness. Purpose: The aim of this article was to identify major research needs related to quality of life at the end of life and quality of the dying process for vulnerable older people at home, in assisted living facilities, in skilled nursing facilities, and in prisons. Design and Methods: Review and analysis of the literature was used. Results: The science is generally weak in relationship to what is known about quality of life at the end of life and quality of dying for vulnerable older adults in different settings. Few studies address actively dying patients and the reasons for transfers between home and other settings. Existing studies are primarily anecdotal, descriptive, have small samples, and involve a single setting. Participant decisional capacity is a barrier to conducting research in these settings. Implications: Research recommendations for each setting and across settings are provided. The National Institutes of Health should clarify criteria for enrollment of persons with diminished, fluctuating, and absent decisional capacity in research. Purpose: This paper describes one program that has developed a screening procedure for assessing elder mistreatment, with a special focus on elder neglect. The aim is to understand how expert neglect assessment teams process and diagnose complex geriatric cases referred for suspected elder neglect. What are the key themes that must be understood in order to determine if neglect should be suspected and confirmed? Design and Methods: Transcripts of audiorecordings of neglect assessment team meetings were analyzed by using grounded theory analysis. Results: Four major themes emerged from the analysis of the transcripts. These themes were understanding the underlying health status of the elder and caregiver, understanding the socioeconomic and life circumstances of the dyad, credibility of data collected by others, and the consequences of the assessment outcome. Implications: These findings offer insight into the development of future clinical screening and assessment procedures used to make diagnoses about elder neglect, as well as the guidelines that govern neglect assessment. Understanding not only the high-risk signs and symptoms but also the context and consequences of neglect is critical. Future screening and assessment procedures should be developed with these data in mind. Purpose:\\u2002We develop a conceptual model and associated assessment template that is usable across state jurisdictions for evaluating the independent-living capacity of older adults in guardianship proceedings.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used an iterative process in which legal provisions for guardianship and prevailing clinical practices for capacity assessment were integrated, through expert group consensus and external review by legal and health care professionals, to form a conceptual model and template.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The model and template provide a structure for conducting and documenting a capacity evaluation in guardianship by using six assessment domains of interest to the courts: (a) medical condition, (b) cognition, (c) functional abilities, (d) values, (e) risk of harm and level of supervision needed, and (f) means to enhance capacity. The template also addresses the participation of the person in the guardianship hearing, confidentiality and privilege issues, and certification by the examiner. An online version of the template can be adapted to address specific jurisdictional requirements.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A conceptual model and evaluation template provide a useful cross-jurisdictional format for conducting and documenting capacity assessments of older adults in guardianship proceedings. The template may be particularly useful to clinicians for providing courts with information to support limited guardianship orders. Purpose:\\u2002The goal of this literature review was to determine the validity and policy relevance of recent estimates from many countries of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) costs.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We searched Medline and other databases for English-language peer-reviewed journals on total, direct, indirect, and per case cost of AD that used 1985–2000 data. We adjusted costs of U.S. studies for inflation. We adjusted non-U.S. studies by that country\\'s medical cost inflation rate and purchasing power parity (PPP). Results:\\u2002Of 71 studies identified, 21 met all criteria for inclusion. Annual inflation adjusted U.S. total costs of AD varied from $5.6 billion to $88.3 billion. AD total per case (direct and indirect) costs varied from $1,500 to $91,000; indirect/family costs varied from $3,700 to $21,000. Among non-U.S. studies, AD annual adjusted per case costs varied from PPP $2,300 to PPP $30,000. Cost variation was due to diverse study methods, data sources, services included, and lack of clear differentiation between cost of AD and cost of caring for people with AD.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The cost of AD is high, although reliable estimates are not available. Costs are likely to rise given expected demographic shifts in all countries. The widely variable cost estimates call into question the real costs of Alzheimer\\'s disease and their applicability to policy initiatives. Purpose: The association between certified nurse aide, licensed practical nurse, and registered nurse turnover and the organizational characteristics of nursing homes are examined. Design and Methods: Hypotheses for eight organizational characteristics are examined (staffing levels, top management turnover, resident case mix, facility quality, ownership, chain membership, size, and Medicaid census), using Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (known as OSCAR) data. Turnover information came from primary data collected from 854 facilities in six states (Missouri, Texas, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey). Results: The 1-year turnover rates were 56.4%, 39.7%, and 35.8% for certified nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, and registered nurses, respectively. The results consistently show that, for all caregivers, lower staffing levels, lower quality, for-profit ownership, and higher bed size are associated with higher turnover. Some differences also are found for different levels of turnover, but there are few differences among types of nursing staff. Implications: Given that turnover rates are problematic, this study gives us a better understanding of the phenomenon and at the same time helps us further understand the wide variation that is known to exist between nursing homes, based on their organizational characteristics. Purpose:\\u2002Effective pain management remains a serious problem in the nursing home setting. Barriers to achieving optimal pain practices include staff knowledge deficits, biases, and attitudes that influence assessment and management of the residents\\' pain.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Twelve nursing homes participated in this intervention study: six treatment homes and six control homes, divided evenly between urban and rural locations. Three hundred licensed and unlicensed nursing home staff members completed written knowledge and attitude surveys at baseline, and 378 staff members completed the surveys after intervention implementation.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Baseline results revealed notable knowledge deficits in the areas of pharmacology, drug addiction and dependence, side effect management, and nonpharmacologic management-strategy effectiveness. Significant differences were noted by job title (registered nurse/licensed practical nurse/certified nursing assistant). Case studies displayed a knowledge application problem, with nurses often filtering resident pain reports through observed resident behaviors. The intervention led to significant improvement in knowledge scores in some, but not all, the treatment homes. Perceived barriers to effective pain management showed a significant decline across all study nursing homes.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Knowledge deficits related to pain management persist in nursing homes. An interactive multifaceted educational program was only partially successful in improving knowledge across settings and job categories. Attitudes and beliefs appear more difficult to change, whereas environmental and contextual factors appeared to be reducing perceived barriers to effective pain management across all participating nursing homes. Purpose:\\u2002The present study hypothesized that simple, everyday physical activity (EPA) would decline with advancing age; that women would have a more favorable EPA profile than would men; and that EPA would have a survival benefit.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Community-dwelling participants (aged 80–98 years, n = 198) wore mechanical actigraphs in order for EPA to be assessed. Individuals were classified as active, inactive, and sedentary based on their level of EPA exhibited over a substantial part of the day. Survival status was available at approximately 2 years.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Mean EPA scores decreased with advancing age and, in contrast to men, women in their early eighties appeared to be protected from declining EPA. This partially supported the hypothesis that women would have a more favorable EPA profile. What is most important is that mean EPA scores predicted mortality. Moreover, when compared with their less sedentary counterparts, sedentary adults were more than three times as likely to be deceased 2 years later.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Researchers need to conduct new trials to determine whether or how physical activity is associated with mortality. Purpose: The study of patterns of residential mobility among individuals around the age of retirement has led to the recognition that for many reasons—climate and cost of living being the most frequently cited—settlement patterns of comparatively affluent retirees will often differ from those of the working-age population. Increasingly, localities may often seek this type of relocation, on the theory that the newcomers will provide a boost to the local economy through expenditures and tax payments. In addition, there is often the perception that such a strategy will not cost the community much in the way of locally provided public services. The past several years have witnessed a substantial increase in efforts to provide some quantitative estimates on the magnitude of these hypothetical effects. Design and Methods: This article aims at providing a summary assessment of such analyses, incorporating research projects in both the United States and Canada. Results: Practically all such studies may be characterized as being exclusively short term in nature; that is, they focus more or less exclusively on the near-term implications of retiree inmigration, which do tend to be overwhelmingly positive from an economic or fiscal perspective. Implications: In general, this area of inquiry may be characterized by a paucity of knowledge regarding the longer term effects of such population movement. There has been no effort to analyze the aging in place of the erstwhile newcomers or the failure of the retirement migration process to generate other than a plethora of opportunities for comparatively low-skill, low-wage service employment. Policies intended to foster amenity migration as an economic development tool would greatly benefit from longer term analyses of the economic implications of the process. Purpose: This descriptive study explored attitudes toward community-based long-term care services and factors influencing service utilization among Japanese American families. Design and Methods: Using grounded theory methodology, the Japanese American sample included 26 family caregivers, 4 persons receiving care, and 14 professional providers (n = 44). Results: Attitudes toward services were identified along six dimensions: ability to meet care needs, autonomy in daily life, quality of care and staff, cost, emotional connotations, and social and physical environment. Participants used formal services in a dynamic manner, meeting both episodic and chronic needs. Families played an active role in sustaining and augmenting the caregiving situation, regardless of living arrangement. Implications: This research highlights the range of criteria included in attitude formation about services and the dynamic nature of the interplay between families and formal services. Research in family caregiving recently has become more challenging because of the strict protection of privacy mandated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.<--?1-->We ask when should Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) follow HIPAA rules to the letter and when might they use the waiver option? What is the appropriate balance between the goals of protecting the privacy of patients\\' personal health information and facilitating family-caregiver research that may benefit them and others? More particularly, should patients be gatekeepers for caregiver participation in minimal-risk research? We describe one approach that successfully met HIPAA criteria and also allowed high-quality research. In developing protocols and applying for IRB approval, researchers must be as familiar with HIPAA regulations as they are with IRB standards. Finally, we recommend changes in the review process that may facilitate research efforts with family caregivers while protecting important privacy interests. Purpose:\\u2002Our purpose in this project was to conceptualize and implement evidence-based fall-prevention programming into senior centers. We present challenges to this process and strategies to overcome them.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We carried out a dissemination project in nine diverse senior centers in Connecticut. Participants included investigators from the Connecticut Collaboration for Fall Prevention (CCFP), senior center administrators, and trained staff interventionists implementing a program of fall prevention based on the Yale Frailty and Injury Cooperative Studies of Intervention Trials (known as the Yale FICSIT). Using CCFP materials that were based on the stages of change, senior center staff developed methods to integrate fall-prevention programming into their centers. We extracted implementation challenges, and the strategies that senior center staff developed to overcome them, from the minutes of monthly work-group meetings. Monthly counts of individual assessments were also a source of data.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Challenges included staffing and the delineation of authority, structural issues, engaging senior center membership, cultural issues, and the modification of existing practices. Each senior center devised site-specific methods to overcome these challenges when CCFP investigators convened work-group meetings. We developed creative strategies to inform senior center membership about fall prevention, and in the first 18 months, 4% of members scheduled individual assessments.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The challenges of integrating evidence-based fall-prevention programming into existing senior center services can be negotiated by collaboration among senior center administrators, health providers, the center membership, and researchers. This experience suggests that senior centers may be important venues to reach older adults with fall-prevention programming. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports on a randomized, controlled intervention study designed to reduce employee turnover by creating a retention specialist position in nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We collected data three times over a 1-year period in 30 nursing homes, sampled in stratified random manner from facilities in New York State and Connecticut and randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Staff outcomes were measured through certified nursing assistant interviews, and turnover rates were measured over the course of the year. In the intervention condition, a staff member was selected to be the facility retention specialist, who would advocate for and implement programs to improve staff retention and commitment throughout the facility. Retention specialists received an intensive 3-day training in retention leadership and in a number of evidence-based retention programs. Ongoing support was provided throughout the project.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Treatment facilities experienced significant declines in turnover rates compared to control facilities. As predicted, we found positive effects on certified nursing assistant assessments of the quality of retention efforts and of care provided in the facility; we did not find effects for job satisfaction or stress.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The study provides evidence for the effectiveness of the retention specialist model. Findings from a detailed process evaluation suggest modifications of the program that may increase program effects. Purpose:\\u2002This article describes the demographic characteristics of participants in a randomized trial (the AAMEN Project) designed to recruit older (aged 55+ years) African American men to a cancer screening trial.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The AAMEN Project is a recruitment trial developed for African American men aged 55+ years living in southeastern Michigan.\\u2003Results: Of the 34,376 African American men in the study, 37.6% had low incomes and 62.4% had moderate-to-high incomes. The average age of the men was 63.3 years (SD = 5.9 years). Among men who were eligible and interested in participating, the proportion of men with low incomes was significantly greater than the proportion of men with moderate-to-high incomes (p <.001).\\u2002Implications:\\u2002The AAMEN Project demonstrated success in recruiting a substantial proportion of men with low incomes as well as men with moderate-to-high incomes. These findings may facilitate the development of future recruitment efforts involving older African American men. Purpose:The purpose of this article is to describe an innovative online system to support long-term-care decision making.Design and Methods:The Long-Term Care Choices tool is a web-based system that uses expert opinion and structures decision making. Results:\\u2002The system has been well accepted, and most users find it easy to use.Implications:Other states could adopt similar systems to help people navigate the long-term-care system. Purpose: We designed this study to examine the reliability of the nursing home survey process in the state of Kansas using regular and simultaneous survey teams. In particular, the study examined how two survey teams exposed to the same information at the same time differed in their interpretations. Design and Methods: The protocol for simultaneous surveys consists of having one in-region and one out-of-region team survey a facility together. Results: The regular and simultaneous survey teams generally agreed about the number of deficiencies. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87 for total deficiencies and 0.76 for deficiencies with scores of G or higher. But in a substantial number of instances the teams did not agree about the scope and severity of the deficiency or about what regulation the nursing home had breached. Implications: The survey process is reliable when assessing aggregate results, but it is only moderately reliable when examining individual citations. Stakeholders (i.e., consumers, policy makers, nursing home administrators) should be aware of the limitations of the survey process. It needs to be modified to reduce variability. Purpose: This study sought to determine whether nursing homes comply with residents\\' do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders prohibiting inpatient hospitalization. Design and Methods: With the use of data from the nationally representative 1996 Nursing Home Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a multivariate logistic regression model was developed. Results: Three percent of residents had DNH orders. These residents were half as likely to be hospitalized. Residents in not-for-profit or public facilities were less likely to be hospitalized than those in for-profit homes. Hospitalization was more likely among men, racial or ethnic minorities, those with more diagnosed health conditions, and those in facilities in the South compared with those in the Midwest. Hospitalized residents with DNH orders had no limitations of activities of daily living, were not located in hospital-based nursing homes, were less likely to be in a for-profit facility, and were sicker than nonhospitalized residents with DNH orders. Implications: Improved education regarding advance directives, particularly DNH orders, is necessary for health care practitioners and patients. More consistent and rigorous policies should be implemented in nursing facilities. Purpose of the Study: In this article, I examine the association between turnover of nursing home administrators and five important quality of care outcomes. Design and Methods: The data came from a survey of 420 nursing facilities and the 1999 On-line Survey, Certification, and Reporting System. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, I looked at the effects of turnover of administrators in nursing homes belonging to chain organi-zations and in nursing homes not belonging to chain organizations. Results: I found the average annual turnover rate of administrators to be 43%. The multivariate logistic regression analyses show that in nursing homes belonging to chains, administrator turnover is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs and with a higher than average number of quality-of-care deficiencies. In nursing homes not belonging to chains I found that turnover of administrators is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were restrained, were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs. Implications: There is a need to improve understanding of how and why better outcomes are achieved in some nursing homes. This investigation serves to focus attention on nursing home administrators. I believe this study provides preliminary evidence that the turnover of administrators may have an important association with quality of care in nursing homes. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of family members\\' responses to open-ended interview questions about an intervention to improve incontinence and mobility care for their relative in a nursing home.\\u2003Design and Methods: The study was a randomized, controlled intervention trial with incontinent nursing home residents (N = 145), wherein research staff provided toileting and walking assistance of sufficient intensity to significantly improve continence and mobility outcomes in the treatment group. Interviewers posed open-ended interview questions to family members after 8 weeks of intervention to assess if they noticed a difference in care.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Family responses to open-ended questions showed that, compared to the control group, the intervention group noticed significant overall improvement in incontinence and mobility care and in residents\\' outcomes in mobility.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Families\\' responses to open-ended questions were sensitive to improvements in incontinence and mobility care and may provide evidence for important care quality differences that would be missed if only direct satisfaction and discrepancy-based closed-ended questions were asked. Purpose: We examined the feasibility of creating a generic training curriculum for volunteers in health promotion programs for older adults by identifying common core content topics across 10 national programs. We also considered additional material that could augment common core content topics.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed in detail program manuals and associated materials from 10 national evidence-based or best practice health promotion programs for older adults that use volunteers. In Phase I, we created a spreadsheet matrix to track and tabulate the frequency of inclusion of elements across all 10 programs. We arrayed elements under appropriate topics, and program administrators reviewed and verified the information. In Phase II, we reviewed the matrix for comprehensiveness and added elements to augment the identified core topics. Program administrators again reviewed the matrix to ensure accuracy.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We found 67 elements of core content across 50% or more of the reviewed health promotion programs. We added 17 elements to enhance curriculum comprehensiveness; these included elements that were (a) in less than 50% of the reviewed programs but recommended by research staff, (b) introduced by research staff, or (c) recommended by program administrators.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Although there are many steps, questions, and issues yet to consider, our findings identify a significant body of general core content that supports the feasibility of creating a generic training curriculum for volunteers as an approach to enhance capacity in evidence-based or best practice health promotion programs. Purpose: The increasing demand for geriatric home-based care makes it timely to examine how the existing system can become most effective and efficient in promoting the functional outcomes of older patients. Design and Methods: A multidisciplinary work group identified home care agency policies, misconceptions of older adults and their caregivers, and practice patterns of nurses, therapists, and home health aides that can impede patients\\' progress toward functional independence. This article describes the process that one home care agency used to remove these obstacles. Results and Implications: The work group developed and implemented a restorative model of care that integrates the medical treatments for acute disease processes and the personal care and rehabilitative interventions directed toward chronic disabilities, to improve the functional outcomes of older adults receiving home care. Purpose:\\u2002The subjective psychological experience of people with moderate to severe dementia living in residential care is insufficiently understood. In the present study we aimed to explore the subjective experience of life with dementia in residential care from the perspective of the person with dementia, and to understand the psychological impact of being in this situation.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This was an exploratory qualitative study. Eighty individuals with dementia who were living in residential care homes engaged in unstructured conversations with a researcher. We subjected the transcripts of the resultant 304 conversations to interpretative phenomenological analysis in order to develop a thematic account.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The experience of living with dementia in residential care was fundamentally one of experiencing difficult and distressing emotions relating to loss, isolation, uncertainty, fear, and a sense of worthlessness. Participants generally tried to cope by accepting and making the best of things and affirming their past sense of self and identity, but some also expressed frustration and anger.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Participants were able to describe aspects of their situation and their emotional response to it, grounded in a strong retained sense of self and identity. The participants\\' experience emphasizes the importance of improving the living situation of elders with dementia in residential care settings. Purpose: This report examines health care rates, charges, and patterns of consumption from a comprehensive California hospitalization data set covering 1986–1995. An improved understanding of current trends in health care consumption would facilitate the development of future resource allocation models. Design and Methods: We obtained discharge and charge data from all licensed nonfederal hospitals in California between 1986 and 1995 relating to inpatient discharges of individuals aged 55 years and older. We used the direct method of standardization to adjust discharge statistics for differing age and gender case mixes, and we adjusted all charges to 1990 dollars for cost comparisons. Results: Standardized to the 1990 population, annual discharge rates declined between 1986 and 1992, then leveled off to about 227 per 1,000 between 1993 and 1995. Rates of both discharges and charges for men consistently exceeded those for women, there being about a 5-year lag between female and male rates of discharge. The insurance payer mix shifted between 1986 and 1995, with dramatic declines in private insurance mirrored by increases in managed care. Implications: Hospital care consumption among the elderly people in California demonstrates a trend of increasing adjusted total charges despite declining hospitalization rates. Overall, individuals aged 55 years and older comprise 18% of the California population and incur 52% of discounted total charges. Private insurance has virtually disappeared, replaced by HMO/PHP/PPO organizations; still, charges to governmental sources (primarily Medicare and Medi-Cal) account for about 78% of total billings. Absolute numbers of Californians aged 55 and older are projected to increase 54% by 2010 and 226% by 2025 compared with 1995, engendering a dramatic increase in the financial burden of health care to this segment of the population. Purpose: Relationships are examined between age and out-of-pocket costs for different health goods and services among the older population. Design and Methods: Age patterns in health service use and out-of-pocket costs are examined by use of the 1990 Elderly Health Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 1,031, age 66+). Multivariate regression is used to examine how age effects are mediated by health, insurance, and socioeconomic variables. Results: Although long-term care expenditures increased with age, out-of-pocket costs for most other services did not. Total out-of-pocket costs increased with age only when nursing home costs were included. Increases with age in hospital and prescription costs were explained by declining health. Patterns of service use suggested reduced access to discretionary care among the oldest old. Implications: Although expenditures did not increase with age for most services, the high personal cost for nursing home care among the oldest old underlines the need for increased efforts to support them in the community. Greater spending by those in poor health highlights the importance of preventing age-related health conditions and their complications. Improved access to discretionary care among the oldest old may help to reduce the need for care in higher cost settings. The high prevalence of out-of-pocket prescription spending across the age range provides impetus for current efforts to reduce these costs. Purpose: The published literature on dementia care mapping (DCM) in improving quality of life and quality of care through practice development and research dates back to 1993. The purpose of this review of the research literature is to answer some key questions about the nature of the tool and its efficacy, to inform the ongoing revision of the tool, and to set an agenda for future research. Design and Methods: The DCM bibliographic database at the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom contains all publications known on DCM (http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/health/dcm). This formed the basis of the review. Texts that specifically examined the efficacy of DCM or in which DCM was used as a main measure in the evaluation or research were reviewed. Results: Thirty-four papers were categorized into five main types: (a) cross-sectional surveys, (b) evaluations of interventions, (c) practice development evaluations, (d) multimethod evaluations, and (e) papers investigating the psychometric properties of DCM. Implications: These publications provide some evidence regarding the efficacy of DCM, issues of validity and reliability, and its use in practice and research. The need for further development and research in a number of key areas is highlighted. Purpose: This study describes the preliminary experiences of 10 states in providing support services to family or informal caregivers of elderly adults and adults with disabilities; it focuses on the newly created National Family Caregiver Support Program, state general funds, Medicaid-waiver programs, and other state-funding streams. Design and Methods: Case studies were conducted, between March and July 2002, through in-person interviews with state officials and stakeholders in Alabama, California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. Results: States were in the start-up phase of implementing the National Family Caregiver Support Program and varied greatly in program design and integration of caregiver support into their home- and community-based care system. Viewing family caregivers as a client population was a paradigm shift for many state officials. Implications: Heavy reliance is currently placed on family and informal caregivers in home- and community-based care, without adequate support services. Family support should be an explicit goal of long-term-care system reform. Purpose: This study examines the role of organizational culture, job satisfaction, and sociodemographic characteristics as predictors of organizational commitment among staff in assisted living. It is particularly important to examine organizational commitment, because of its close links to staff turnover. Design and Methods: Data were collected from 317 staff members in 61 facilities, using self-administered questionnaires. The facilities were selected from licensed assisted living programs and were stratified into small, traditional, and new-model homes. Staff questionnaires were distributed by a researcher during 1-day visits to each facility. Organizational commitment was measured by the extent of staff identification, involvement, and loyalty to the organization. Results: Organizational culture, job satisfaction, and education were strong predictors of commitment, together explaining 58% of the total variance in the dependent variable. Higher levels of organizational commitment were associated with more favorable staff perceptions of organizational culture and greater job satisfaction. In addition, more educated staff members tended to report higher levels of organizational commitment. Other than education, sociodemographic characteristics failed to account for a significant amount of variance in organizational commitment. Implications: Because job satisfaction and organizational culture were strong predictors of commitment, interventions aimed at increasing job satisfaction and creating an organizational culture that values and respects staff members could be most effective in producing higher levels of organizational commitment. Purpose: The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a community-based program providing primary, acute, and long-term care to frail elderly individuals. A central component of the PACE model is the interdisciplinary care team, which includes both professionals and non-professionals. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the team\\'s overall performance and the risk-adjusted health outcomes of program enrollees. Design and Methods: The study included interdisciplinary teams in 26 PACE programs and 3,401 individuals enrolled in them. We combined information about individuals\\' health, functional, and mental status from DataPACE with an overall measure of team performance. We used multivariate regression techniques to test the hypothesis that better team performance is associated with better risk-adjusted health outcomes: survival and short-term (within 3 months of enrollment) and long-term (within 12 months of enrollment) improvements in functional status and in urinary incontinence. Results: Team performance was significantly associated with better functional outcomes (both short and long term) and with better long-term urinary incontinence outcomes. There was no significant association with survival. Implications: This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between team performance and patient outcomes in long-term care. It suggests that PACE programs can improve patient outcomes by improving the functioning of care teams. Purpose: Support of older adults\\' capacity to age in place is a core concept of the assisted living philosophy. This research examined implementation of the aging-in-place philosophy in 1 midwestern state (Kansas). Design and Methods: This study was part of a larger state agency and university collaborative project to examine admission and discharge policies in these settings. Data analysis was conducted with descriptive statistics. Kansas findings were compared to national findings. Results: Residents\\' capacity to age in place was limited by facility admission and discharge policies that were more restrictive than state regulations in the areas of behavioral problems, incontinence, and cognition. In general, assisted living facility policies in Kansas were more restrictive than admission and discharge policies found nationally. Implications: More inclusive assisted living admission and discharge criteria, and concomitant staffing and funding, are necessary if the aging-in-place philosophy is to be more fully implemented. Purpose:\\u2002The aim of this study was to measure the impact of professionally conducted community-based cultural programs on the physical health, mental health, and social activities of individuals aged 65 and older.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants in the study were 166 healthy, ambulatory older adults from the Washington, DC, area. We assigned them to either an intervention (chorale) or comparison (usual activity) group and assessed them at baseline and after 12 months.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results obtained from utilizing established assessment questionnaires and self-reported measures, controlling for any baseline differences, revealed positive findings for the effectiveness of the intervention such that the intervention group reported a higher overall rating of physical health, fewer doctor visits, less medication use, fewer instances of falls, and fewer other health problems than the comparison group. The intervention group also evidenced better morale and less loneliness than the comparison group. In terms of activity level, the comparison group evidenced a significant decline in total number of activities, whereas the intervention group reported a trend toward increased activity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The positive impact of participatory art programs for older adults in this study on overall health, doctor visits, medication use, falls, loneliness, morale, and activities reflects important health promotion and prevention effects and a reduction of risk factors driving the need for long-term care. Purpose:\\u2002We explored Bandura\\'s self-efficacy theory as applied to older adult (aged 63–92) participation in physical and social activity in a cross-cultural study. Design and Methods: Older adults in Spain (n = 53) and the United States (n = 55) completed questions regarding self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and participation in physical and social activities.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Self-efficacy significantly predicted both physical and social activity in both Spain and the United States. Outcome expectancy did not significantly predict either activity, nor did education, gender, or overall health. Modified and new self-efficacy measures proved reliable in both samples.Implications: This study enhances understanding of how self-efficacy motivates participation in physical activity, as noted in previous studies, as well as provides a new understanding of what motivates participation in social activities. The high reliability of the new measures used in this study provides evidence for further use of these measures in other contexts. It is important to note that this study further supports the use of Bandura\\'s theory of self-efficacy for cross-cultural applications. Purpose: This study tests the effectiveness of the theoretically driven BACE (i.e., Balancing Arousal Controls Excesses) intervention in decreasing agitation in residents of long-term care with moderate or severe dementia. Design and Methods: A pretest–posttest double-blinded experimental design with random assignment was used with a sample of 78 participants. The BACE intervention controls the daily activity schedule so that there is a balance between a person\\'s high-arousal and low-arousal states. The outcome measure was observed agitation. Results: When time spent in arousal imbalance at pretest was controlled for, a repeated measures analysis of covariance revealed a statistically significant Group × Time interaction, F(1, 69) = 4.26, p =.043, with a partial η2 =.06. The average change in agitation for the treatment group was a decrease of 8.43 points (SD = 12.01) from pretest to posttest, an effect size of.7. Implications: The results of this study support the theory that balancing arousal states by using an individualized approach is effective in decreasing agitation levels of people with dementia. We describe the prevalence, assessment, and treatment of, as well as characteristics associated with, depression in residential care/assisted living and nursing home residents with dementia. Overall, 25% of the participants were depressed. Depression was related to severe cognitive impairment, behavioral symptoms, pain, and for-profit nursing home residence. Purpose: The aim of this research was to derive network types among an elderly population and to examine the relationship of network type to morale. Design and Methods: Secondary analysis of data compiled by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (n = 2,079) was employed, and network types were derived through K-means cluster analysis. Respondents\\' morale scores were regressed on network types, controlling for background and health variables. Results: Five network types were derived. Respondents in diverse or friends networks reported the highest morale; those in exclusively family or restricted networks had the lowest. Multivariate regression analysis underscored that certain network types were second among the study variables in predicting respondents\\' morale, preceded only by disability level (Adjusted R2 = .41). Implications: Classification of network types allows consideration of the interpersonal environments of older people in relation to outcomes of interest. The relative effects on morale of elective versus obligated social ties, evident in the current analysis, is a case in point. Conducting research in the home setting with homebound older adults presents distinct ethical and practical challenges that require special consideration. This article describes the methodological issues that make studying homebound older adults especially vulnerable to therapeutic misconception and researcher role conflict and offers practical strategies for researchers to deal with these problems when studying this population. In writing this article, we draw on more than a decade of descriptive and intervention research focusing exclusively on the homebound older population in which the authors have collaborated. Therapeutic misconception and researcher role conflict may occur because of methodological issues related to the recruitment of participants, the “homebound” status of participants, and the home setting as the interview site. Particular care is required on the part of the researcher to address these ethical issues. This may be accomplished especially through clear communication during the informed consent process with participants and in scientific communication with colleagues. Purpose:\\u2002The potential effects of implementing three different minimum benefits in Social Security, which have accompanied proposals to privatize the program and reform family benefits, are examined in relation to the adequacy of benefits for women reaching age 62 between 2020 and 2030.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The 1992 Health and Retirement Study is used to conduct a simplified microsimulation.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The minimum benefit proposal accompanying privatization proposals, which requires 40 earnings years for a poverty level benefit, fails to cover significant numbers of vulnerable women. The elimination of spousal benefits, criticized for being outdated and regressive, helps offset the costs of more generous minimum benefits, such as those that require residency or 10 earnings years for eligibility.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Noncontributory benefits distributed based on marital status are not as effective at protecting poorer women, as well as a new generation of women that is less likely to be married, than are minimum benefits where eligibility is tied to U.S. residency or simply Social Security eligibility. Purpose: This study examined how the amount of informal care received by disabled elders changes when they are receiving publicly paid home care, and whether formal service use, disability, caregiving arrangements, and demographic characteristics of older adults predict changes in the amount of informal care. Design and Methods: Hierarchical linear models were estimated, using 3-year data (12 repeated observations) collected from elderly participants (N = 888) in Michigan\\'s Home- and Community-Based Medicaid Waiver Program. Results: The amount of informal care declined in the beginning period when publicly paid home care was received, and then it stabilized. Changes in activities and instrumental activities of daily living and caregiver residence predicted changes in the amount. The living arrangement and age of elders predicted different patterns of change over time. Neither formal service amount nor its change significantly predicted the amount of informal care. Implications: Informal caregivers do not relinquish caregiving when publicly paid home care is available. Expanding community-based long-term care is a means of fostering partnerships between formal and informal caregivers. Purpose:\\u2002This article estimates the effects of alcohol consumption on self-reported overall health status, injuries, heart problems, emergency room use, and hospitalizations among persons older than the age of 65.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed data from the first wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative study. We used multivariate regression and instrumental variables methods to study the associations between alcohol consumption (current drinking, binge drinking, and average number of drinks consumed) and several indicators of health status and health care utilization.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002Alcohol consumption by women was associated with better self-perceived health status, improved cardiovascular health, and lower rates of hospitalizations. We detected no significant negative or positive associations for older men.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings suggest that light to moderate alcohol use by older women may have beneficial health effects. Experimental trials, however, are needed to more rigorously assess the potential benefits of alcohol use by elders due to the inherent biases of observational studies. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if older adults are capable and willing to interact with a computerized exercise promotion interface and to determine to what extent they accept computer-generated exercise recommendations. Design and Methods: Time and requests for assistance were recorded while 34 college-educated volunteers, equal numbers of men and women, ranging in age from 60 to 87, interfaced with a health promotion tool. The computerized exercise promotion tool\\'s ease of use and the acceptability of the exercise recommendations made were rated by the participants. Results:On average, completion of the items on the computer took 33 min and each participant made 3 requests for assistance, of which only 22% were mouse related. The system\\'s ease of use and the exercise prescription acceptability ratings were high and independent of prior experience with computers. Implications: User friendliness of computerized health promotion tools will determine if, and how, health providers integrate these new technologies into daily practice. The participants in the study were able to complete the computerized items within a reasonable amount of time and with minimal assistance from the provider. These data support the potential of interactive technology in health promotion among the expanding older population. Purpose: This article reports on a within-family study to identify factors that lead mothers to expect that a particular child will serve in the role of primary caregiver. Design and Methods: Data for this study were collected by in-person interviews with a representative sample of 566 mothers between the ages of 65 and 75 years residing in the greater Boston area, who provided detailed information regarding all of their adult children. Both multivariate and qualitative data analyses were conducted. Results: Emotional closeness and similarity of gender and attitudes were strongly associated with which children mothers identified as probable caregivers. Findings regarding exchange were mixed. Mothers were more likely to name adult children who had provided them with support; however, mothers\\' past provision of assistance to children was unrelated to expectations regarding care. No aspects of children\\'s availability besides proximity and employment of adult children affected mothers\\' expectations. In selecting a primary caregiver, mothers emphasized expressive characteristics of intergenerational relationships, rather than instrumental and contextual factors associated with children\\'s availability. Implications: The findings indicated a discrepancy between maternal preference for care and actual patterns of support from adult children. Practitioners who work with older adults and their families should incorporate parents\\' views of the “likely” caregiver into family counseling protocols. Family counseling in both the precaregiving and actual care provision stages may be useful to clarify expected roles for children. Purpose: This study compared the response time, response rate, and cost of two types of survey administration techniques: e-mail/web-based versus conventional postal mail. The main aim of the survey was to collect descriptive information on the existence of Acute Care for Elders units and their characteristics by surveying geriatric division chiefs. Design and Methods: Two randomized cohorts of geriatric division chiefs were formed to receive a survey either by electronic mail (n = 57) or by conventional postal mail (n = 57). If there was no response to the initial mailing, two follow-up mailings were sent to both groups using the original modality; a third follow-up was performed using the alternative modality. For each group, response rate and response time were calculated. The average total cost was computed and compared across two groups. Results: The aggregate response rate was 58% (n = 31) for the e-mail group versus 77% (n = 44) for the postal mail group. The overall average response time was shorter in the e-mail group, 18 days compared with 33 days for the conventional postal mailing group. The cost comparison showed that average cost was $7.70 for the e-mail group, compared to $10.50 per response for the conventional mail group. Implications: It appears that although the web-based technology is gaining popularity and leads to lower cost per response, the conventional postal method of surveying continues to deliver a better response rate among the geriatric medicine division chiefs. The web-based approach holds promise given its lower costs and acceptable response rate combined with the shorter response time. Purpose: This paper describes a model process to increase the exposure of middle and high school students to information on aging so they better understand the implications of an aging population and the stereotypes of older adults. Design and Methods: A college Gerontology Institute, a social studies teacher education faculty member, and middle/high school social studies teachers collaborated on a program to develop and implement lesson plans that incorporate information on aging into existing courses. Institute staff provided expertise on gerontology and student teachers assisted in writing lesson plan objectives. Results: Teachers developed about a dozen lessons covering from one class to two weeks in subjects such as global history, participation in government, Western civilizations, economics, and government. This experience suggests a number of issues that should be addressed when developing a gerontology infusion initiative with school teachers. Implications: Information on aging can be successfully incorporated into existing school curricula within the constraints of mandated learning objectives. Purpose:\\u2002The initial diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\\'s disease is highly dependent on caregiver reports of patient performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). However, these reports may not always be reliable. We investigated the cognitive skills of caregivers, specifically their executive functioning (EF), as a potential explanatory variable of discrepancies between caregiver report of and patient performance on ADLs.\\u2003Design and Methods:Forty spousal dyads consisting of one cognitively unimpaired spouse and one spouse with either mild cognitive impairment (n = 20) or mild to moderate Alzheimer\\'s disease (n = 20) were included in the study. Caregivers completed eight measures of EF and reported on their spouses\\' ADL performance, which was then directly assessed. Caregiver education and a composite EF score were then used to predict the difference in ADL ratings. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Regression analyses revealed that caregiver EF composite score (β =.33; p =.04) and level of education (β = −.11; p <.05) were significant predictors of the discrepancies between caregiver ADL reports and directly assessed patient performance on ADLs (R2 =.11; p =.04).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings of this study suggest that the executive skills of spousal caregivers may influence the accuracy of subjectively reported ADL measures. Physicians should be aware of such potential biases when evaluating patients for memory disorders and should consider using objective measures for assessing functional impairment within their patient population. Future studies should investigate whether cognitive training and educational programs for caregivers increase the accuracy of their ADL reports. Purpose:\\u2002The majority of dependent older adults receive care at home from a family member. Caregiving places enormous demands on these caregivers and the negative consequences associated with caregiving are well documented. In this study we compared the effectiveness of two active interventions to a waiting-list control condition to improve emotional well-being in family caregivers.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We randomized distressed caregivers (N = 91) of physically impaired older adults to one of three conditions: traditional weekly sessions, minimal-therapist-contact sessions, or a waiting-list control group. These manual-guided interventions took place over a 2-month period.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Caregivers in the traditional weekly sessions experienced the highest reduction in depressive and anxious symptoms. Compared with control participants, caregivers in the traditional weekly sessions had lower posttreatment levels of depression and anxiety. They had also lower levels of depression than did caregivers in the minimal-therapist-contact intervention.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These data suggest that traditional weekly sessions may be effective in reducing caregiver anxiety and depression. They further suggest that traditional weekly sessions are better than no intervention, and they are also better than a minimal-therapist-contact intervention. Purpose: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a multimedia support program delivered over the Internet to employed family caregivers of persons with dementia. Design and Methods: The evaluation of this program involved 299 employed family caregivers participating in a pretest–posttest randomized clinical trial with a 30-day follow-up and a waitlist control condition. Validated instruments include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale, the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Caregiver Strain scale from Benjamin Rose, and Positive Aspects of Caregiving used in the nationwide REACH study. Results: Those who viewed Caregiver\\'s Friend: Dealing with Dementia 30 days postexposure demonstrated significant improvements in depression, anxiety, level and frequency of stress, caregiver strain, self-efficacy, and intention to seek help, as well as perceptions of positive aspects of caregiving. Implications: Interactive multimedia interventions delivered over the Internet appear to be uniquely suited to provide low-cost, effective, convenient, individually tailored programs that present educational information, cognitive and behavioral skills, and affective learning opportunities. This makes Web-based multimedia a promising avenue for work–life balance programs, employee-assistance providers, and organizations interested in improving family caregiver health and well-being. Purpose: This article describes the organization, operation, and evaluation of the Oklahoma Aging Advocacy Leadership Academy (OAALA). Design and Methods: The Academy was designed to assure the continuation of future cohorts of advocates and volunteers for aging programs and services. It is a statewide training program consisting of 10 weekend sessions. The curriculum incorporates age-related content and advocacy/leadership/voluntary skills training. Evaluation consisted of: (a) a pre–post assessment of perceived familiarity with advocacy and volunteer leadership issues; (b) post-Academy participant assessments of the quality of various aspects of the Academy; (c) post-Academy written statements about areas that were valuable and in need of change; and (d) a compilation of student volunteer and advocacy activities. Results: Evaluation results indicate that the OAALA led to significant increases in perceived familiarity with issues and very positive participant assessments of quality. In addition, many participants spontaneously initiated advocacy and volunteer activities while enrolled in the Academy. Implications: Our experience with the Academy suggests that it is a feasible means of preparing individuals to become successful old-age advocates and volunteer leaders. Purpose: This article investigates the extent to which government-subsidized affordable rental units available to low-income older persons are unequally and unfairly distributed throughout Florida\\'s counties. Design and Methods: Primary data sources from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census were analyzed using two location inequality statistical measures: quintile analysis and the Dissimilarity Index. Three comparison standards measuring the county locations of the community-wide low-income elderly and nonelderly populations were used to judge whether these patterns are geographically unfair. Results: Compared with the overall locations of Florida\\'s low-income older population, elder-occupied government-subsidized rental housing units are concentrated in fewer counties. On the basis of several standards, these affordable housing units are judged to be unfairly located, resulting in most of the state\\'s low-income elderly population living in counties that are underserved by these accommodations. Implications: The findings offer other states and local areas guideposts to assess and compare the extent of geographic inequality and unfairness in the availability of their affordable senior housing opportunities. Why these inequalities exist and their implications for older persons are researchable questions. The aging of the baby boom generation, together with research that links volunteerism and positive health outcomes in later life, has contributed to a burgeoning of interest in initiatives and programs promoting civic engagement among older adults. Although useful in potentially expanding role options in later life, this growing attention also underscores the importance of stepping back to critically examine frequently overlooked questions concerning the framing and potential consequences of the new emphasis on civic engagement. Following a brief review of semantics and definitional issues in this area, we use a critical gerontology framework, emphasizing both political economy analysis and perspectives from the humanities, to explore underlying questions such as these: What roles are older adults being encouraged to play in civic life? What meanings are implied by these roles? What political and economic forces underlie these roles? What types of civic engagement are left out of the conversation? Our goal is to encourage a broadening of the dialogue to include potentially problematic normative and political economic dimensions of civic engagement, particularly volunteerism, as they pertain to older adults. Purpose: Psychological well-being, an important indicator of successful aging, may be conceptualized quite differently across cultures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we developed a measure of psychological well-being based on the indigenous expertise of Thai elders. Design and Methods: Data were collected from older people in Thailand in four stages with staggered qualitative and quantitative methods: individual and focus group interviews (n = 67); a preliminary survey (n = 477); cognitive interviews (n = 30); and a second survey (n = 460). We analyzed the resulting psychological well-being items to identify their underlying factor structure and psychometric properties. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that psychological well-being has two components: intrapersonal and interpersonal. The subscales for this measure have adequate reliability and validity. Implications: This research provides evidence for cultural variability in the nature of psychological well-being and highlights the importance of developing measures that are culturally relevant. Purpose:\\u2002This study evaluated whether the satisfaction levels of long-term-care residents and their family members concerning incontinence and mobility care were sensitive to an improvement intervention. Design and Methods: A randomized, controlled intervention trial with incontinent long-term-care residents was conducted wherein research staff provided toileting and walking assistance. The frequency of assistance was of sufficient intensity to significantly improve continence and mobility outcomes in the treatment group as a whole. Interviews were conducted with residents and family members at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention to assess their satisfaction with and preferences for incontinence and mobility care, using two question types: (a) direct satisfaction and (b) a discrepancy index of “met needs” reflecting the difference between perceived and preferred care frequencies. Results: Both residents and family members reported high rates of satisfaction to direct satisfaction questions. Residents\\' reports were sensitive to care improvements based only on the discrepancy index measure. Few family members were able to answer specific questions about incontinence and mobility care frequencies, and their reports were insensitive to care improvements. Implications: The majority of incontinent long-term-care residents were able to reliably answer questions about their perceived and preferred care frequencies related to incontinence and mobility care. A discrepancy index based on these questions was sensitive to care frequency improvements. Family members\\' reports were not sensitive to improvements, and direct satisfaction questions were misleading for both residents and family members. Purpose:\\u2002Longitudinal research in dementia has acknowledged the importance of transitions during the course of family caregiving. However, long-term adaptation to institutionalization has received little attention. This study attempts to describe caregivers\\' adaptation (changes in stress, well-being, and psychosocial resources) to placement up to 4 years following institutionalization.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using data from the Caregiver Stress and Coping Study, this analysis constructed four longitudinal panels, each consisting of a preplacement assessment and either two (n = 146), three (n = 109), four (n = 75), or five (n = 38) waves after placement. We used growth curve models to examine longitudinal trajectories of adaptation in various measures of stress, global well-being, and psychosocial resources.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The findings suggested sharper decreases in stressors (e.g., role overload) and indicators of negative mental health in the shorter term panels. However, more significant intraindividual variation existed in caregivers\\' adaptation to placement in the longer term panels (four and five waves of postplacement).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002There is relative stability in caregiver long-term adaptation to institutionalization. However, the variability in adaptation emphasizes the need to target postplacement clinical interventions to families most at risk for negative outcomes during the transition to institutional care. The medical malpractice crisis that is currently spreading across the United States bears many similarities to earlier crises. One novel aspect of the current crisis is the explicit inclusion of litigation against nursing homes as a target of reform. Encouraged by the nursing home industry, policymakers are considering the extension of conventional medical malpractice tort reforms to the nursing home sector. In this article, we caution against such an approach. Nursing home litigation has a number of distinctive features that raise serious questions about the wisdom of implementing reforms generically across the care continuum. Drawing on findings from our previous study of nursing home litigation, we outline these features and argue for careful attention to them as policymakers evaluate options for reform. Purpose:\\u2002Using a health services utilization conceptual framework, the purpose of this analysis was to examine race differences in factors predictive of the behavioral intention of older persons to participate in a clinical treatment trial should they have a diagnosis of cancer. In addition, the analysis sought to determine if older African Americans were less likely than Whites to express willingness to participate, given knowledge of the Tuskegee syphilis study and greater fatalistic cancer beliefs.Design and Methods: Data were drawn from a community-based telephone survey of 216 African Americans and 222 Whites, 50 years of age and older.Results:\\u2002Findings show that willingness to participate was significantly higher among males, persons of younger age, higher incomes, and with nonfatalistic cancer beliefs. Race differences were only apparent for the two significant interactions of race with age and high income. Neither knowledge of the Tuskegee study nor fatalistic cancer beliefs were more important for African Americans than for Whites.Implications:\\u2002Study findings suggest that recruitment strategies need to be tailored to racial differences in factors affecting willingness to participate, particularly those related to age and income level. Purpose of the Study: This study sought to increase knowledge about the impact of rater role on the assessment of in-home supportive care. The authors compared the perspectives of care recipients and professionals on one aspect of the broad concept of quality of care in home care—the sufficiency of the amount of care provided by informal and formal caregivers. Design and Method: Sufficiency of home care was assessed through concurrent elderly persons\\' self-report through telephone interview and nurse clinical report based on in-home interviews with the elder. Care was assessed in terms of the sufficiency of the amount of informal and formal assistance received to meet functional dependency needs. Statistical analyses compared the ratings of elder and professional. Results: Professional ratings of the sufficiency of care were significantly lower than those of the elderly care recipients. From the perspective of both care recipients and professionals, sufficiency of care was significantly related to coresidence of elder and caregiver, and to caregiver health. Implications: Consistent with previous literature, rater role was found to influence the assessment of the sufficiency of in-home care. Researchers and providers should recognize that care recipient and professional ratings are not interchangeable. Purpose: The objective of this research is to investigate whether home accommodations influence the amount of human help provided to a nationally representative sample of adults who use wheelchairs. Design and Methods: We analyzed data from the Adult Disability Follow-back Survey (DFS), Phase II, of the Disability Supplement to the 1994–1995 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS-D). The analytic sample consisted of 899 adults aged 18 and older who reported using wheelchairs in the previous 2 weeks. We conducted logistic regression and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses to test the influence of home accommodations on the receipt of any human help, and among respondents who received help, on the hours of help received, respectively. We analyzed paid and unpaid help separately. Results: Home accommodations were related to the receipt of unpaid, but not paid, help. Relative to having no home accommodations, the presence of each additional accommodation decreased the odds of having unpaid help by 14% (OR =.86; 95% CI =.76,.97). Additionally, we observed an inverse relationship between the number of accommodations in the home and hours of unpaid help (p <.01). For wheelchair users who live alone, specific types of home accommodations were also inversely related to hours of unpaid help. Implications: Policies that reimburse for home accommodations may be an efficient response to the growing demand for home-care support while enabling greater autonomy and independence for people who use wheelchairs. Purpose: This longitudinal study examined whether the use of adult day care services delayed time to nursing home placement in persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Design and Methods: Two hundred and eighteen adult day care clients with Alzheimer\\'s disease were recruited from 16 adult day programs in a large metropolitan area. Two hundred and ninety eight persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease but not using adult day care were recruited from a federally funded Alzheimer\\'s diagnostic center and frequency matched to adult day care users on age, gender, race, and level of cognitive impairment. Participants were followed at 3-month intervals for up to 48 months. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the effects of adult day care and other fixed and time-varying factors on risk of nursing home placement. Results: Risk of nursing home placement increased significantly with the number of days of adult day care attendance, with this effect being substantially greater for men (hazard ratio or HR = 1.33; confidence interval or CI = 1.18–1.49) than for women (HR = 1.09; CI = 1.00–1.18). Participant disability and hospitalizations and caregiver age and burden were independent predictors, but their inclusion in the model did not alter the risk associated with adult day care. Implications: More severe disease and greater caregiver burden did not explain the increased risk of nursing home placement among adult day care users with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Rather, it appears that other unmeasured factors, such as a proclivity to institutionalize, may account for the association of adult day care to nursing home risk. Purpose:\\u2002This article explores the experiences of family carers of older people in using support services in six European countries: Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK.\\u2003Design and Methods:Following a common protocol, data were collected from national samples of approximately 1,000 family carers per country and clustered into comparable subgroups to facilitate cross-national analysis.Results:\\u2002Carers\\' use of available support services is limited across Europe but is considerably higher in Germany, Sweden, and the UK than in Poland, Greece, and Italy. Service use is more prevalent among wives and carers with stronger support networks and less frequent among working daughters with high levels of burden, suggesting the need for a reconsideration of eligibility criteria and better targeting of service responses. Access to and use of services is characterized by a divide between carers in northwestern Europe, who experience few difficulties other than the older person\\'s refusal to accept the support offered, and carers in southeastern Europe, where service affordability and poor transportation present remarkable barriers. Concerns regarding the timeliness and quality of support are common to all countries.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002European Union-wide efforts to improve carer support need to focus on improving the care system\\'s ability to provide timely, high-quality care delivered by staff who treat the older person with dignity and respect, and to enhance cooperation between health professionals (in all countries), informal networks (especially in southeastern Europe), social services (particularly in Sweden and the UK), and voluntary organizations (in Germany and the UK). Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to describe the projected use for long-term-care services through 2012.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We constructed a static-component projection model using age, function, and other covariates. We obtained enrollee projections from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and combined these with nursing home and community long-term-care service use rates from the 1999 National Long-Term Care Survey and the 2000 National Health Interview Survey.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Over the next decade, the number of oldest veterans (aged 85+) will double, and VHA-enrolled veterans aged 85 and older will increase sevenfold. This will result in a 20–25% increase in use for both nursing home and home- and community-based services. VHA currently concentrates 90% of its long-term-care resources on nursing home care. However, among those who receive long-term care from all formal sources, 56% receive care in the community. Age and marital status are significant predictors of use of either type of formal long-term-care service for any given level of disability. VHA\\'s experience with the mandatory nursing home benefit suggests that even when the cost to the veteran is near zero, only 60–65% of eligibles will choose VHA-provided care. Assisted living represents nearly 15% of care provided during the past decade to individuals in nursing homes, and approximately 19% of veterans using nursing homes have disability levels comparable to those of men supported in assisted living.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002As most of the increased projected use for long-term care will be for home- and community-based services, VHA will need to expand those resources. Use of VHA resources to leverage community services may offer new opportunities to enhance community-based long-term care. Purpose: Bringing state-subsidized assisted living services (ALS) into congregate housing (CH) is a strategy for reducing rates of nursing home placement. This article discusses CH residents\\' reactions as a new ALS program was introduced in their housing, and it provides recommendations for others who are considering the implementation of similar programs. Design and Methods: Focus groups and face-to-face interviews with residents in a CH facility explored their experiences over time with the new ALS program. Residents were interviewed before the program was initiated and 6 months later as a way to better understand their knowledge of and feelings about the program. Results: A qualitative analysis of the interview data revealed several patterns of complex attitudes and emotions linked to the program. Although the overwhelming majority of residents endorsed the program as a way to avoid nursing home placement, few understood the features of the program (e.g., cost and eligibility requirements). ALS participants\\' accounts of services suggested the presence of a highly “medicalized” approach. Implications: When new community-based models are implemented for elders, policy makers need to evaluate how these programs affect quality of life. Further, program guidelines for bringing ALS into existing housing have to address how the program complements the home-like nature of the housing. Purpose: The volume of research on end-of-life care, death, and dying has exploded during the past decade. This article reviews the conceptual and methodological adequacy of end-of-life research to date, focusing on limitations of research to date and ways of improving future research. Design and Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify the base of end-of-life research. Approximately 400 empirical articles were identified and are the basis of this review. Results: Although much has been learned from research to date, limitations in the knowledge base are substantial. The most fundamental problems identified are conceptual and include failure to define dying; neglect of the distinctions among quality of life, quality of death, and quality of end-of-life care. Methodologically, the single greatest problem is the lack of longitudinal studies that cover more than the time period immediately before death. Implications:Gaps in the research base include insufficient attention to psychological and spiritual issues, the prevalence of psychiatric disorder and the effectiveness of the treatment of such disorders among dying persons, provider and health system variables, social and cultural diversity, and the effects of comorbidity on trajectories of dying. Purpose:\\u2002The purposes of this study were (a) to identify cognitive abilities and other factors related to successful completion of training for computer-based tasks that simulated real jobs and (b) to create a brief assessment battery useful in assessing older adults for these kinds of jobs.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants from three age groups (young, middle-aged, and older) completed a battery of cognitive measures. They then trained on one of three computer-based tasks that simulated actual jobs and were asked to perform the tasks for 3 days. We recorded whether they completed training and whether and how well they did the tasks. In a series of logistic regressions, we evaluated the ability of a subset of cognitive measures drawn from a larger battery to predict participants\\' ability to successfully complete training and go on to task performance.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results confirmed theory-based expectations that measures of domain knowledge, crystallized intelligence, memory, and psychomotor speed would predict success in computer-based activities. A brief battery was able to predict older adults\\' successful completion of training for one task but was less useful for another.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A brief battery of cognitive measures may be useful in evaluating individuals for job selection. Different measures are related to job-related criteria depending on task and group evaluated, although it was not possible to identify a reduced battery for one task. The specific cognitive abilities related to participants\\' success have implications for task and interface design for the elderly population. Purpose: To develop an instrument that can be used to answer three questions: What is the prevalence of ageism in various societies? Which types of ageism are more prevalent? Which subgroups of older people report more ageism? Methods: A survey instrument was developed listing 20 types of ageism. This instrument was tested on a convenience sample of 84 persons older than age 60. Results: The instrument appears to have satisfactory reliability and validity. The survey found that the experience of ageism was widespread and frequent among these respondents. The majority reported several incidents of ageism and over half of the incidents were reported to have occurred \"more than once.\" The most frequent types were persons showing disrespect for older people, followed by persons showing assumptions about ailments or frailty caused by age. Implications: Researchers now have a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the prevalence of ageism in various societies and of various types of ageism experienced by various groups of older persons. This may aid in reducing the prevalence of ageism in our society. Purpose:\\u2002In this prospective study, we examine the reasons for benzodiazepine use among Russian-speaking elderly people in Israel, and we discuss issues related to immigrants. We provide information that can be applied to the improvement of age-related health and social services.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002During a 6-month period, we interviewed late-life Russian-speaking immigrants in Israeli independent living facilities to determine benzodiazepine use among such individuals.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Among individuals interviewed, 69% reported use; 45% of those who used the substance did so daily. Respondents aged 80 and older were more likely than those aged younger than 80 to use benzodiazepines. More men (78%) than women (67%) reported use, but we found no significant difference in a comparison of gender status and pattern of drug use.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Although other studies of drug use show that patterns of use differ significantly among older men and women, this research indicates that gender status does not appear to influence the pattern of, and reasons for, benzodiazepine use. Additional studies are needed in order for researchers to further understand the nature and extent of benzodiazepine use. Such information should be applied to the development of policies and services that will address the quality-of-life needs of individuals who use or misuse this drug and others like it. Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the relationship between aspects of objective and perceived housing and aspects of healthy aging, defined as independence in daily activities and subjective well-being. Furthermore, this research examined the comparability of relationships between housing and healthy aging in the five European countries. Design and Methods: Data were drawn from the ENABLE–AGE Project, from home interviews with a sample of 1,918 very old people aged 75 to 89 years living alone in their own homes in Swedish, German, British, Hungarian and Latvian urban areas. Results: Participants living in better accessible homes, who perceive their home as meaningful and useful, and who think that external influences are not responsible for their housing situation are more independent in daily activities and have a better sense of well-being. Moreover, these results apply to all five national samples. Implications: The findings can widen the perspective when striving for barrier-free building standards, to encompass a holistic approach that takes both objective and perceived aspects of housing into account. Home modification and relocation should not be prescribed, but need to be negotiated with older adults to take into account their personal preferences. Purpose:This article examines various technical challenges inherent in the design, implementation, and dissemination of health care quality performance measures.Design and Methods:Using national and state-specific Minimum Data Set data from 1999, we examined sample size, measure stability, creation of ordinal ranks, and risk adjustment as applied to aggregated facility quality indicators.Results:Nursing home Quality Indicators now in use are multidimensional and quarterly estimates of incidence-based measures can be relatively unstable, suggesting the need for some averaging of measures over time. Implications:Current public reports benchmarking nursing homes\\' performances may require additional technical modifications to avoid compromising the fairness of comparisons. Purpose: Parkinson\\'s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurological disorder that frequently results in nearly total disability. This study examined changes over 3 years in patients\\' experiences living with PD, and explored how participants\\' health perceptions and predicted mortality at baseline related to their actual death by Year 3. Design and Methods: Data were obtained from a local sample of 109 participants by in-home interviews. Results: The collected results (1) suggested a disconnection between the participants\\' responses to open-ended questions about the disorder, compared with their responses to questions structured by the investigators; (2) demonstrated changes in responses to structured and open-ended questions; and (3) demonstrated that respondents who declined to predict whether they would be living in 10 years were three times more likely to die by Year 3 than those who answered the question. Implications: Results demonstrate the importance of identifying the most important issues for the individual with PD and suggest that these issues may change over time. Results also raise issues surrounding how patients\\' perceptions influence the course of their disease. Purpose: \\u2002This study reported a qualitative analysis of health-seeking behaviors of community-dwelling elderly Chinese Americans on the influences of family network, cultural values, and immigrant experience in their use of health resources. Barriers to health care, pathway of health care, and adaptation of health care by use of self-treatment and Eastern and Western medicines were also examined. Design and Methods: The investigators used content analysis to obtain themes and key points of focus group interview data (N = 25) to explore the elderly participants\\' attitudes, values, and practices in their use of health resources. Survey questionnaires in Chinese were used to compile demographic data. Results: Findings suggested a shift from traditional expectations of filial piety to more dependence on neighbors and friends, and a genuine adaptability to combining Eastern and Western health care modalities. Immigration was not proposed by these Chinese elders as an explanation of shifts in expectations for family support or values. Implications: This study has implications for research, service delivery, and policy making for health care of ethnic elderly persons, particularly in addressing structural and cultural issues in access and compliance. Purpose: This study identified modifiable risks associated with incident functional dependence, compared their effects, and estimated the percent risk attributable to each factor, by ethnicity. Design and Methods: The prospective study cohort comprised 751 rural Hispanic and non-Hispanic White elders from southern Colorado who reported no dependence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs and IADLs) at baseline. Logistic regression modeled the effects of physical inactivity, nutritional risk, smoking, and falls on incident disability 22 months later, with and without adjustment for baseline ADL and IADL difficulty. Population attributable risk percentages assessed these modifiable risks by ethnicity. Results: Each risk factor multiplied the likelihood of incident dependence by 1.4 or more, adjusted for covariates. Attributable risk percentages ranged from 8% to 32% depending on risk factor, ethnicity, and baseline ADL and IADL difficulty status. Attributable risk was generally greater among Hispanic elders, the result of higher prevalence of most of the risk factors. Implications: Interventions targeted at inadequate nutrition, inactivity, smoking, and preventable falls offer opportunities to reduce incident functional disability, especially among Hispanic elders. Purpose:\\u2002We examined the relationship between the quality indicator for decline in activities of daily living (ADL) and the use of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for determining Medicaid skilled nursing facility reimbursement.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the 2004 National MDS Facility Quality Indicator reports as the dependent variable in a multilevel regression model. Our primary explanatory variable was a state-level binary variable distinguishing whether or not the state used an MDS-based Medicaid-reimbursement system in 2004. We obtained control variables through the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting System.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Skilled nursing facilities located in states that used the MDS for Medicaid reimbursement reported more ADL decline than did facilities in states that did not use the MDS for reimbursement.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The finding suggests that the ADL-decline quality indicator captures more than just quality, including state-level policy differences. Therefore, the ADL-decline quality indicator should be investigated and refined prior to being relied on for pay-for-performance initiatives. Purpose:\\u2002Recent data (2002) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that almost 11% of all cases of AIDS were diagnosed in people 50 and older. Despite the steady rise and future projections of increase, there is still a paucity of education and prevention programs targeting this population. This article reports on the development and piloting of an HIV/AIDS education prevention program. It describes an educational curriculum that provides older adults with accurate information about the relevance of HIV/AIDS to their lives.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A purposive sample (n = 249) of ethnically and economically diverse adults 50 years and older was selected from 14 organizations in rural and urban settings in California. They were surveyed to determine their interest in participating in HIV/AIDS education prevention programs.\\u2003Results:\\u2002A majority of participants reported interest in an HIV/AIDS prevention program for older people, with female respondents more likely to attend than male respondents. Participants who were moderately or very religious were also more likely to attend. Participants expressed preference for prevention education through presentations at centers serving older adults, and from physicians and other health care providers. On the basis of these findings, a specialized curriculum targeting older adults was developed, presented, and disseminated.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002People 50 years and older are sexually active, lack accurate information about HIV/AIDS, and are in need of HIV/AIDS education. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined the extent to which older adults identified in a statewide abuse hotline registry utilized behavioral health services. This is important as mental health issues have been identified as a high priority for filling gaps in services for victims of mistreatment. Design and Methods:\\u2002We compared Medicaid and Medicare claims data for two groups of older adults: those using health services and identified within a statewide abuse hotline information system and those claimants not identified within the hotline database. Results:\\u2002Behavioral health service use was greater among those identified in the abuse hotline database. The penetration rate (percentage of service users out of all enrollees) for Medicaid behavioral health service claims was more than twice that of other service users, with costs of services about 30% greater. Analyses of Medicare data revealed that the penetration rate for those in the hotline data was almost 6 times greater at approximately twice the cost compared to other service users. Implications:\\u2002The results provide evidence for previous assumptions that mistreated individuals experience a higher rate of behavioral health disorders. As mental health screening by adult protective services is rarely conducted, the results suggest the need to train investigators and other service providers to screen older adults for behavioral health and substance-abuse issues as well as physical signs of abuse. Further research on the relationship of abuse to behavioral health might focus on collection of additional data involving more specific victim-related characteristics and comparisons of cases of mistreatment versus self-neglect. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article was to review existing knowledge about assisted living (AL) use by traditionally underserved populations, including people of color, low-income people, and those living in rural communities.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed methodologies and findings of research on AL and residential care up to June 2004. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Some studies suggested that low-income people and people of color either are less likely to utilize AL or receive AL in settings with less space and amenities and/or lower scores in selected quality measures. Generalizations from national or multistate studies to the population have methodological limitations. Numerous topics remain unstudied, including the pricing of AL, the experience of choosing an AL facility, the presence of discriminatory admission and retention practices, and the role of resident preferences. Data on access to AL in rural areas are inconclusive.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We offer recommendations for national surveys to better classify supportive housing settings. Furthermore, we suggest quantitative and qualitative studies to illuminate the experience of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and rural populations in AL settings. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop a short and a screening version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) that would be suitable across diagnostic groups of cognitively impaired older adults, and that could be used for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies. Design and Methods: We used data from 413 caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults referred to a memory clinic. We collected information on caregiver burden with the 22-item ZBI, and information about dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and the frequency of problem behaviors among care recipients. We used factor analysis and item–total correlations to reduce the number of items while taking into consideration diagnosis and change scores. Results: We produced a 12-item version (short) and a 4-item version (screening) of the ZBI. Correlations between the short and the full version ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and from 0.83 to 0.93 for the screening version. Correlations between the three versions and ADL and problem behaviors were similar. We further investigated the behavior of the short version with a two-way analysis of variance and found that it produced identical results to the full version. Implications: The short and screening versions of the ZBI produced results comparable to those of the full version. Reducing the number of items did not affect the properties of the ZBI, and it may lead to easier administration of the instrument. Purpose: This study examined the prevalence, correlates, and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults. Design and Methods: The authors analyzed cross-sectional data from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey\\'s Supplement on Aging. Data were weighted to be representative of the noninstitutionalized population aged 70 years and older. Results: Overall, 20.7% of those needing help to perform 1 or more ADLs (an estimated 629,000 persons) reported receiving inadequate assistance; for individual ADLs, the prevalence of unmet need ranged from 10.2% (eating) to 20.1% (transferring). The likelihood of having 1 or more unmet needs was associated with lower household income, multiple ADL difficulties, and living alone. Nearly half of those with unmet needs reported experiencing a negative consequence (e.g., unable to eat when hungry) as a result of their unmet need. Implications: Greater, targeted efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence and consequences of unmet need for ADL assistance in elderly persons. Purpose:The goals of this study are to describe the current state of residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) care and residents in comparison with nursing home (NH) care and residents, identify different types of RC/AL care and residents, and consider how variation in RC/AL case-mix reflects differences in care provision and/or consumer preference.Design and Methods:Data were derived from the Collaborative Studies of Long-Term Care, a four-state study of 193 RC/AL facilities and 40 NHs. Multivariate analyses examined differences in ten process of care measures between RC/AL facilities with less than 16 beds; traditional RC/AL with 16 or more beds; new-model RC/AL; and NHs. Generalized estimating equation models determined differences in resident case-mix across RC/AL facilities using data for 2,078 residents.Results:NHs report provision of significantly more health services and have significantly more lenient admission policies than RC/AL facilities, but provide less privacy. They do not differ from larger RC/AL facilities in policy clarity or resident control. Differences within RC/AL types are evident, with smaller and for-profit facilities scoring lower than other facilities across multiple process measures, including those related to individual freedom and institutional order. Resident impairment is substantial in both NHs and RC/AL settings, but differs by RC/AL facility characteristics.Implications:Differences in process of care and resident characteristics by facility type highlight the importance of considering: (1) the adequacy of existing process measures for evaluating smaller facilities; (2) resident case-mix when comparing facility types and outcomes; and (3) the complexity of understanding the implication of the process of care, given the importance of person–environment fit. Work is continuing to clarify the role of RC/AL vis-à-vis NHs in our nation\\'s system of residential long-term care. Decades of conservative attempts to scale back Social Security and Medicare, by limiting the program\\'s universality through means testing and drastic benefit cuts, have failed. Thus, after numerous unsuccessful attempts at dismantling the U.S.\\'s universal old-age welfare state, or even meaningfully restraining its growth, conservative critics have developed a new approach. They are wrapping promarket “privatization” policy proposals in the popular universal framework of Social Security and Medicare. What is fundamentally different about privatization is that it embraces (or at least acquiesces to) key aspects of universalism, including broad-based eligibility and benefits that “maintain accustomed standards of living,” which leave universal programs with rock-hard public support. Proponents argue privatization will “save” these programs. What distinguishes this approach from past retrenchment efforts is that promarket privatization policies, while supporting key universal tenets, will retrench Social Security\\'s and Medicare\\'s redistributive facets. Instead of limiting the most popular features of universalism, privatization proposals limit the redistributive elements of our large social insurance programs. Purpose: We examined age-cohort differences in the interrelationships among marital processes and depressed affect. Design and Methods: We used data from individuals in first marriages that participated in the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The NSFH interviewed one adult per household of a nationally representative sample. Participants were categorized into young (n = 2,289), middle-aged (n = 1,145), and older adult (n = 691) age cohorts. Results: The three age cohorts did not differ on negative marital processes (NMP), but older adults scored significantly higher on marital satisfaction than young and middle-aged adults. Marital satisfaction mediated the link between NMP and depressed affect for young adults and older adults. NMP were more strongly related to depressed affect for young adults than middle-aged adults, whereas marital satisfaction was more strongly related to depressed affect for older adults than young adults. Implications: Our findings on age-cohort differences in the salience of marital processes to depressed affect are discussed in light of socioemotional selectivity theory. Research has shown over the years that the self-perceptions of older adults about their health and well-being may be at least as important as objective data for predicting the course of their health over time. I review a series of studies that span 30 years in which I and my colleagues have asked older adults in the community about their self-rated health and well-being across a spectrum of parameters, including self-rated health, social support, and mood (both negative and positive), and about whether their basic needs are being met. The social environment shapes perceptions of health and well-being, as does the body. Feelings, such as feelings about health and well-being, are therefore a key (but not the only) psychological–behavioral bridge between the body (genome and physiology) and society (environmental stressors and social context). Following a review of these studies, I attempt to place these perceptions of health and well-being in a social context, a context critical to understanding the consistency and strength of these studies (and others performed over many years) documenting the association between answers to the question “How do you feel about...?” and health outcomes over time. Purpose: This study describes the experiences of workers hired under consumer direction. Design and Methods: Medicaid beneficiaries who volunteered for the Cash and Counseling demonstration were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could participate in the consumer-directed program, or the control group, which was referred to agency care. Paid workers for both groups were surveyed about 10 months after demonstration enrollment. Results: Directly hired workers for the treatment group were nearly always the consumers\\' friends or relatives. The two groups received similar wages and both were highly satisfied with their working conditions and the supervision they received. Compared with agency workers, directly hired workers who lived with or were related to the consumer were more likely to report emotional strain and a desire for more respect from the consumer\\'s family; however, no such differences were observed for directly hired workers who were not relatives. Directly hired workers and agency workers providing comparable amounts of care reported similar levels of injury and physical strain, although directly hired workers received less formal training. Implications: The Cash and Counseling model does not appear to cause adverse consequences for the hired workers. Directly hired workers report high levels of job satisfaction and do not suffer physical or emotional hardship beyond what might be expected for individuals providing care to relatives. However, states might be able to reduce emotional strain and injuries by providing educational materials and referrals for consumers, their families, and workers, and by having counselors monitor workers\\' well-being. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to determine if differences in service use exist between dementia patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiaries seen at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center with a VA Outpatient Clinic File diagnosis of dementia in 1997. The primary dependent measure was amount of Houston VA health service use from study entry until the end of fiscal year 1999 or until death.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 864 dementia patients in the identified cohort, two thirds had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. Examination of 2-year health service use revealed that, after adjusting for demographic and medical comorbidity differences, dementia patients with psychiatric comorbidity had increased medical and psychiatric inpatient days of care and more psychiatric outpatient visits compared with patients without psychiatric comorbidity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Further understanding of the current health service use of dementia patients with psychiatric comorbidity may help to establish a framework for considering change in the current system of care. A coordinated system of care with interdisciplinary teamwork may provide both cost-effective and optimal treatment for dementia patients. Purpose:\\u2002There is little empirical translation of multimodal cognitive activity programs in “real-world” community-based settings. This study sought to demonstrate in a short-term pilot randomized trial that such an activity program improves components of cognition critical to independent function among sedentary older adults at greatest risk.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We randomized 149 older adults to Experience Corps® (EC) or a wait-list control arm. Participants randomized to EC trained in teams to help elementary school children with reading achievement, library support, and classroom behavior for 15 hr/week during an academic year. We compared baseline and follow-up assessments of memory, executive function (EF), and psychomotor speed at 4 to 8 months by intervention arm, adjusting for exposure duration. We observed a range of EF abilities at baseline and stratified analyses according to the presence of baseline impairment using established norms.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, EC participants tended to show improvements in EF and memory relative to matched controls (ps <.10). EC participants with impaired baseline EF showed the greatest improvements, between 44% and 51% in EF and memory at follow-up, compared to declines among impaired-EF controls (ps <.05).\\u2003Implications:Short-term participation in this community-based program designed to increase cognitive and physical activity in a social, real-world setting may train memory and, particularly, executive functions important to functional independence. This community-based program represents one potentially effective model to bring high doses of sustainable cognitive exercise to the greatest proportion of older adults, particularly those sedentary individuals at elevated risk for health disparities. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to examine the decision-making abilities of residents in assisted living regarding abuse and neglect.\\u2003Design and Methods: Twenty-seven residents in assisted living facilities were recruited for this descriptive study. Participants were administered an interview to assess baseline knowledge of support services, including ombudsman programs. They were next asked to watch videotaped scenarios of common types of elder abuse (physical, verbal, fiduciary, neglect) and asked to identify abusive situations. Finally, the participants were asked to develop a plan of action if they were to experience similar situations.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The results suggested poor awareness of available elder support services (M = 25%). Residents performed fairly well in the simple identification of the abusive situations (54%), but had difficulty generating acceptable strategies for handling abusive situations. Approximately 25% had no suggestion, 50% reported they would consult a family member, and 25% had nonspecific suggestions (e.g., talk to staff about problem).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results of this study suggest that residents of assisted living facilities are poorly informed about protective services and uncertain about options if care were not optimal. Further work with larger samples is needed to confirm these results. This article uses a retrospective approach to critique the research base underlying the nursing home culture-change movement—an effort to radically transform the nation\\'s nursing homes by delivering resident-directed care and empowering staff. The article traces the development of the movement from its inception 10 years ago to 2005, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented its own initiative to support the movement, thus giving it new momentum, to the present day. This historical overview provides context for a proposed research agenda aimed at strengthening the movement\\'s empirical base, thereby facilitating culture-change interventions as well as helping the movement navigate the next step in its evolution. Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine whether the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E is predictive of mortality in a community-based sample. Design and Methods: Of the stratified random household sample of 4,162 participants age 65 years and older enrolled in the Duke site of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, those included in the present study were the 1,998 who were genotyped for apolipoprotein E (alleles ε2, ε3, and ε4) six years after baseline, and for whom survival status eight years later was known by search of the National Death Index. Information on demographic characteristics, physical and mental health status, functional status, and health services use was determined by structured questionnaires administered in person in the home. Results: The ε4 allele did not predict mortality for the group as a whole, or for those who were cognitively impaired. It did predict mortality for those who reported having had a heart attack or stroke. Implications: The apolipoprotein ε4 allele—although a risk factor for Alzheimer\\'s disease, heart disease, and stroke—was only found to be a risk factor for mortality for those community residents who had had a heart attack or stroke. Otherwise, for this community-based sample, 71 years of age and older, it did not predict time to death and was not a risk factor for mortality. Purpose of the Study: The overall purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between widowed persons\\' baseline assessments of self-efficacy beliefs and their ratings of perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem obtained in an 18-month follow-up. Design and Method: At Time 1, a survey of sociodemographics, a multidimensional measure of global self-efficacy, and a domain-specific measure of self-efficacy, having eight subscales of self-efficacy (interpersonal, instrumental, emotional, social support, nutritional, physical, financial, and spiritual) were administered to a group of 231 widows and widowers to obtain baseline assessments of their self-efficacy beliefs. At Time 2, a follow-up of 211 widows and widowers was conducted to obtain their perceptions of health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and levels of self-esteem 24 months following spousal loss and to assess whether self-efficacy beliefs play a predictive role in widowed individuals\\' perceptions of their health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem. Results: A series of gender-specific multiple regression analyses models revealed that widows and widowers differ significantly with respect to the relationship between specific domains of self-efficacy and their perceived quality of life in the longer term following spousal loss. Implications: Implications of the findings are discussed for clinicians and health professionals working with bereaved spouses in terms of intervention programs for retraining of self-efficacy. Purpose:\\u2002The aim of this study was to identify the important factors influencing residents\\' satisfaction in residential aged care and to provide a better understanding of their interrelationships.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect the required information, including resident satisfaction, resident dependency levels, and staff satisfaction. A stratified random sampling approach was utilized to select facilities. All residents satisfying the selection criteria (i.e., understand English, be sufficient cognitive competence, have a sufficient energy level to participate in the survey, and live in the facility for more than 4 weeks) and all care staff were invited to participate. A total of 996 residents and 895 staff from 62 facilities (36 hostels and 26 nursing homes) provided the required data. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the interrelationships among three sets of contributing factors, related to the facility, staff and residents, and resident satisfaction components, separately for nursing home and hostel residents.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall fits of both nursing home and hostel models were satisfactory. This study has revealed that staff satisfaction plays a crucial and central role in determining resident satisfaction in nursing homes, whereas it has less impact in hostels. The provision of more care hours has only a small, yet positive, impact on resident satisfaction. Larger facility size has a negative impact on resident involvement. Older residents were found to be more satisfied with staff care.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results provide a comprehensive understanding of what influences resident satisfaction. By accounting for important factors identified by residents, a resident-focused care model can be developed and implemented, leading to better service for aged care residents. Purpose:\\u2002We sought to determine the prevalence of remediable health conditions from in-home geriatric assessments of referred adult protective service (APS) clients suffering elder mistreatment.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a retrospective cohort study of 211 APS clients (74% female; age, M = 77 years) in two central New Jersey counties.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Dementia was the most frequent diagnosis (62% prevalence) and was positively correlated with occurrences of financial exploitation (R =.199; p =.01) and caregiver neglect (R =.174; p =.03) among female APS clients. Depression (37% prevalence), hypertension (36%), involuntary weight loss (34%), pain (32%), and falling (26%) all appeared equally distributed, though urinary incontinence (23% prevalence) was strongly correlated with circumstances of caregiver neglect (R =.31; p =.003).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This new effort to link APS workers with geriatric clinicians conducting in-home health assessments proved effective for identifying a high prevalence of remediable health conditions among APS clients suffering various manifestations of elder mistreatment. Purpose:\\u2002The burden of prescription drug costs on Medicare beneficiaries has become a critical policy issue in improving the Medicare program, yet few studies have provided detailed and current information on that burden. The present study estimates total and out-of-pocket expenditures for prescription drugs and the burden of these costs in relation to income among the elderly population. We also compare spending and burden across major subgroups of the elderly population, as defined by socioeconomic and health characteristics, and we distinguish the impact of these factors by using multivariate models.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study uses nationally representative data on Medicare beneficiaries from the 1997 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Cost and Use files. The study estimates out-of-pocket prescription drug spending and burden through ordinary least square, median, and logistic regression models with corrections for the complex survey design.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Our results show that in 1997, nearly 8% of the older population, more than 2.3 million people, spent greater than 10% of their income on prescription drugs. Despite pharmacy coverage, out-of-pocket cost burden fell most heavily on women and those with chronic health conditions. Burden was also higher among those with self-purchased supplemental coverage.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The impact of Medicare reform proposals on these subgroups has to be carefully evaluated. Purpose: This study examined the formation of state government policies concerning persons with dementia. In particular, we identified variables associated with the passage of pertinent state laws by testing three theoretical models of policy formation: the iron triangle, the policy system, and an integrated model. Methods: We sampled 44 states and counted the number of laws concerning individuals with dementia that passed during the 1998 legislative sessions. We constructed nine independent variables to represent the three theoretical models of state policy formation. Then the number of legislative actions were regressed onto each model. Results: The integrated model that consisted of political actors, legislative features, and environmental inputs met goodness-of-fit criteria for a maximum likelihood regression analysis (χ2/df = 1.55). The advocacy effort of the Alzheimer\\'s Association, number of legislative champions, supply of special care beds for persons with dementia, and recent policy activity were related significantly with increased legislative activity concerning individuals with dementia. Implications: Policy responses concerning persons with dementia increasingly have been created within state governments, and we identified variables associated with the passage of pertinent state laws. This research also contributed to the advancement of comparative state policy research by contrasting the three theoretical models of policy formation. Purpose: We used measures created to assess the quality of life (QOL) of nursing home residents to distinguish among nursing facilities. Design and Methods: We statistically adjusted scores for 10 QOL domains derived from standardized interviews with nursing home residents for age, gender, activities of daily living functioning, cognitive functioning, and length of stay, and then we aggregated them to the facility level. We compared the patterns across a sample of 40 facilities. We correlated facility characteristics with QOL scores. Results: The pattern of QOL scores for each of the 10 domains was generally consistent within a given facility. Although resident characteristics played a major role in explaining variance, there were significant effects of facilities as well. Some modest relationships were found between facility characteristics such as ownership, percentage of private rooms, and rural–urban location and facility QOL scores. No effect of facility size was detected. Implications: This article shows that it is possible to differentiate among facilities on the basis of resident self-reported QOL. On the basis of our analysis, we find that a sample of 28 residents per facility is sufficient to generate a reliable QOL score for each of the domains studied. Purpose: This study reviews staffing standards from the 50 states and the District of Columbia to determine if these standards are related to nursing home staffing levels. Design and Methods: Rules and regulations for states\\' nursing home staffing standards were obtained for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Nurse staffing data were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting (known as OSCAR) database. The minimum hours per resident day (HPRD) staffing standards for each state were categorized according to the following: no state-specific HPRD standard (adheres only to federal staffing guidelines); low HPRD standard (≤ 2.5 HPRD); and high HPRD standard (> 2.5 HPRD). A series of hierarchical linear models examined the relationships between state staffing standards and actual facility staffing (total, licensed, and certified nurse aide HPRD), using a number of covariates. Results: The variance in facility staffing was much greater within than between states. Facilities in states with high staffing standards had somewhat higher staffing than states with no standards or low standards, whereas facility staffing in states with low standards was not significantly different from that in states with no standards. Other factors, such as resident acuity and average state Medicaid rate, also were related to staffing. Implications: State staffing standards may not be effective policy tools because they are only one of many factors that affect facility staffing levels. Setting a low minimum HPRD standard may fail to raise staffing, or it may even have a dampening effect on staffing rates in facilities. Purpose: The psychiatric home visit is an effective intervention for elderly patients who otherwise would not receive mental health services. Home visits also have potential to be useful for training. Here, the current practice of home visits in geropsychiatry fellowship programs is examined. Design and Methods: The directors of 55 current geropsychiatry fellowships in the United States were sent a 13-item questionnaire regarding the use of home visits for training. Results: Of the 51% of programs responding, 57% provide a formal home-visit experience for fellows. Respondents commented favorably regarding the educational value of home visits, but raised concerns about funding this time-intensive clinical activity. Implications:Training programs in geropsychiatry can benefit from the inclusion of home-visit programs. A description of a recently established home-visit program illustrates the feasibility of such an enterprise when developed as a collaboration between a teaching hospital and an appropriate community agency. This arrangement provides training for fellows and allows the agency to provide broad mental health services. Purpose:\\u2002This study analyzed the effect of consumer-directed versus agency-directed home care on satisfaction with paid personal assistance services among Medicaid beneficiaries in Washington State.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study analyzed a survey of 513 Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home- and community-based services. As part of a larger study, we developed an 8-item Satisfaction With Paid Personal Assistance Scale as the measure of satisfaction. In predicting satisfaction with personal assistance services, we estimated an ordinary least squares regression model that was right-censored to account for the large percentage of respondents who were highly satisfied with their care.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Among the older population, but not younger people with disabilities, beneficiaries receiving consumer-directed services were more satisfied than individuals receiving agency-directed care. There was no evidence that quality of care was less with consumer-directed services. In addition, overall satisfaction levels with paid home care were very high.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study supports the premise that consumer satisfaction, an important measure of quality, in consumer-directed home care is not inferior to that in agency-directed care. The positive effect of consumer direction for older people underlines the fact that this service option is relevant for this population. In addition, this research provides evidence that home- and community-based services are of high quality, at least on one dimension. Purpose:\\u2002This study examines the moderating effect of staff stability on the relationship between management practices used to empower nurse aides and resident outcomes in a multistate sample of nursing homes. An adaptation of Kanter\\'s theory of structural power in organizations guided the framework for the model used in this study. Design and Methods: Management practices and nurse aide staff stability measures were taken from a survey of directors of nursing (n = 156) and day-shift charge nurses (n = 430) in a stratified random sample of nursing facilities in Maine, Mississippi, New York, and Ohio (n = 156). Facility risk-adjusted pressure ulcer incidence rates and social engagement scores, taken from the Minimum Data Set, served as resident outcome measures. A hierarchical linear regression model was used to test the moderating effect of staff stability. Results: The situation in which higher numbers of rewards were given to nurse aide staff was associated with lower incidence of pressure ulcers, whereas the situation in which nurse aides had more influence in resident care decisions was associated with higher aggregate social engagement scores. The inclusion of nurse aide staff stability in the regression model provided additional explanatory information for the relationship between management practices and resident outcomes. Facilities experiencing low turnover and high retention were associated with lower pressure ulcer incidence, whereas facilities with high turnover and high retention were associated with higher social engagement scores. Implications: This study suggests that certain management practices used to empower nurse aides can influence resident outcomes. Further, effects of nurse aide staff stability vary with respect to the physical versus psychosocial nature of the outcome. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of the study was to empirically test items of a new measure designed to assess person-directed care (PDC) practices in long-term care.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002After reviewing the literature, we identified five areas related to PDC: personhood, comfort care, autonomy, knowing the person, and support for relationships. We also identified an additional component of environmental support. We developed items to reflect the constructs, and then a series of lay and professional experts in the field reviewed the items for face validity. We distributed the resulting 64-item PDC and Environmental Support for PDC measure to direct care workers and nursing, administrative, and other staff from a range of long-term settings across Oregon, culminating in a sample size of 430 participants from eight sites. We employed exploratory factor analyses to reveal the underlying structure of the measure.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After we dropped 14 items from the measure, it attained good simple structure, revealing five PDC constructs as previously theorized and three Environmental Support constructs: Support for Work With Residents; Person-Directed Environment for Residents, and Management/Structural Support. All constructs were conceptually distinct and internally consistent, and, as expected, all were positively correlated.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The PDC measurement tool developed through the Better Jobs Better Care demonstration program funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is an important step toward operationalizing the philosophies inherent in the concepts of PDC and is expected to be a useful tool in evaluating successes in meeting PDC goals and in prompting further research regarding PDC and its consequences for resident and client outcomes. Purpose: To describe death-related planning and preferences for place of death among well elders in a community characterized by a low rate of hospital deaths. Design and Methods: Cross-sectional prevalence survey of independent-living residents (n = 219) of a continuing-care retirement community (CCRC) in Central North Carolina characterized by a low rate of hospital deaths. Results: Death-related planning played a part in the decision of 40% of residents to move to the CCRC. A majority of residents reported a clear preference for place of death, and a majority of these preferred to die on the CCRC campus. Most residents wanted to discuss their preferences for place of death with their health care provider. Preferences for place of death appear consistent across age cohorts and are relevant to elders\\' long-term care decisions. Implications: Given the striking discrepancy between patients\\' preferences for nonhospital deaths and the high prevalence of hospital deaths in the United States, this often-neglected issue should be routinely addressed in end-of-life planning. The CCRC may be a practice model that is particularly compatible with personal preferences for place of death. Purpose:This study examined how rural hospitals altered their postacute and long-term care strategies after the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97). Design and Methods:A nationally representative sample of 540 rural hospital discharge planners were interviewed in 1997. In the year 2000, 513 of 540 discharge planners were reinterviewed. The study is a descriptive analysis of how rural hospitals formed new and altered existing organizational strategies during a time of turbulent changes in federal government reimbursement policy. We classify rural hospital strategic behavior in 1997 according to the Miles and Snow typology of Prospectors, Analyzers, Defenders, and Reactors, and then we examine how the various hospital types altered key strategies following BBA97. Results:Between 1997 and 2000, more than 26% of sampled rural hospitals that did not participate in the swing-bed program in 1997 (44/167) had chosen to do so in 2000, whereas only 3% of those using swing beds in 1997 had eliminated them (12/346). Other strategies such as divestiture of hospital-based nursing homes were related to concurrent swing-bed adoption. Rural hospitals also increased their reliance on formal linkages with external providers of long-term care. Implications:After the BBA97 reimbursement changes, rural hospitals increased their reliance on swing beds and formal linkages to external providers. We observed changes in overall strategy types, away from the Defender and toward the Prospector and Analyzer strategy types. Our findings illustrate the importance of swing beds as a critical buffer for rural hospitals challenged by the uncertainty of the post-BBA97 environment. Purpose of the Study: This study was initiated to forecast the number of older drivers and passengers who may be fatally injured in traffic crashes in future years. Design and Methods: The study was based on data from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System covering the period from 1975 to 1998. Projections were based on least squares regression models. Results: About 35,000 drivers and passengers died in traffic crashes each year from 1975 to 1998. Older adults (65 and older) accounted for 10% of all fatalities in 1975, 17% in 1998, and a projected 27% by 2015, the same proportion predicted for drivers and passengers aged younger than 30. On the basis of these projections, the number of fatally injured women and men aged 65 and older will increase respectively by 373% and 271% between 1975 and 2015. Implications: If current trends continue, the number of fatalities among older drivers and passengers and those aged younger than 30, may be equivalent early in this century. These projections call for further research into conditions that may lead to crashes involving older drivers and for the development and implementation of initiatives to curb traffic-related fatalities among older adults. Purpose: Getting dressed is an activity that is of particular difficulty for many persons with dementia, given the need for hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, and overall planning skills. Despite several studies concerning interventions to improve dressing behavior, very little is known about the dressing process as it is currently performed. The purpose of this study is to characterize the dressing activity of daily living (ADL) of nursing home residents suffering from dementia and thereby identify ways to improve the dressing process. Design and Methods: We analyzed videotapes of dressing of 20 special care unit residents to describe the dressing process and the interaction between residents and staff members. Results: Staff members completely dressed the residents in the majority of cases. Interaction between the staff members and the residents was considered insufficient in most sessions. Implications: The study identified possible intervention techniques, assistive devices, organizational routines, and environmental changes that may improve the dressing process. The results have implications that nursing homes may consider in their policies, care activities, staff training, and environment to facilitate safety, comfort, and satisfaction during the dressing process. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to consider how human rights concepts developed by the international human rights movement could contribute to advocacy efforts on behalf of the aging in an era of population aging. Design and Methods: This study evaluated changes in popular perceptions of aging, the concomitant need for a reformulation of aging advocacy, and the role that human rights concepts could play in protecting older persons. It then considered human rights concepts as they are related to the issues of work, retirement security, health care, and long-term care. Results: Human rights apply to all aspects of the life spectrum and can be a powerful force in defending and protecting older persons by operating as a baseline for establishing the underlying values for aging policies and by linking older persons\\' concerns with the other segments of society. Implications: The study\\'s conclusion suggests that seniors\\' groups should use human rights principles as a new foundation on which to develop new approaches to their public education and advocacy efforts. Purpose: This study explored similarities and differences in social support, home health service utilization, and health outcomes across four racial–ethnic groups of elders. Design and Methods: 1999 Outcomes Assessment Information Set records for 7,374 home care recipients who were 75 years of age or older and who were discharged to self-care were selected for bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Similar levels of skilled service utilization were observed across racial or ethnic groups. Disparities were found in supportive assistance and physical and mental health outcomes. At discharge to self-care, more Black elders had no supportive assistance compared with all other groups; fewer Hispanics and Asians had improved physical functioning compared with Black and White elders. More White elders reported anxiety and depressive symptoms than any other racial or ethnic group. Implications: The findings suggest that racial–ethnic minorities and White elders may have differential needs for mental health and supportive services at discharge from home health care. Purpose: In this study we examined psychosocial adaptation to vision loss and its relationship to depressive symptomatology in legally blind older adults with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Design and Methods: The 144 study participants were outpatients of a large regional vision clinic that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of ARMD in older adults. They were administered a battery of cognitive and psychological screening instruments including the Adaptation to Vision Loss Scale, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, and the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale. Results: A principal components analysis of the Adaptation to Vision Loss Scale identified three distinct adaptation factors, namely, acceptance of vision loss, negative impact on relationships, and attitudes toward compensation. Of these, acceptance of vision loss and attitudes toward compensation were positively associated with depressive affect. In addition, self-reported use of outpatient rehabilitative services was less frequent in those reporting greater depressive symptomatology. Implications: These findings support the contention that depressive symptomatology as measured by self-report in older adults with ARMD is mediated by one\\'s perceived sense of individual control as it relates to intrapersonal factors underlying adaptation to profound vision loss in old age caused by ARMD. Purpose: This study examined changes in leisure activities of older adults over an 8-year period, and associated sociodemographic and health characteristics. Design and Methods: Data were from a longitudinal study conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; 380 respondents were interviewed in-person in both 1985 and 1993. Changes in ten specific activities and the overall number of activities continued were examined. Results: Theater/movies/spectator sports and travel were the activities least likely to be continued over the 8-year period; watching television and reading were most likely to be continued. Characteristics significantly related to changes in activities were age, gender, education, and self-rated health in 1985 as well as changes in marital status, self-rated health, and functional ability between 1985 and 1993, although no consistent pattern emerged. Implications: Leisure education is discussed as a means of introducing modifications to enhance older adults\\' participation in desired activities. Directions for future research are highlighted. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to enhance adherence among older (aged 55 years and older) African American men enrolled in a cancer screening trial for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer. For this study, we defined adherence as completing the trial screenings.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a randomized trial design. Case managers contacted intervention group participants (n = 352) at least monthly by telephone and provided information and referral services. The control group included 351 participants. Results:\\u2002Among participants with low income, those in the intervention group had higher screening adherence rates than did participants in the control group for (a) prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer (74.3% vs 53.0%, p =.001), (b) digital rectal exam for prostate cancer (66.2% vs 46.1%, p =.011), and (c) chest x-ray for lung cancer (70.9% vs 51.3%, p =.012). We found no statistically significant differences in adherence rates for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening for colorectal cancer. In contrast, among participants with moderate-to-high income, we found no statistically significant differences in adherence rates between intervention and control group participants for any of the screening tests. Implications:\\u2002The case management intervention was effective in enhancing adherence among participants with the lowest income, who in many studies are the most difficult to retain. Purpose: The number of residents in assisted living has rapidly increased, although these facilities still primarily serve people who can pay out of pocket. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was authorized to provide this level of care for the first time in the Assisted Living Pilot Program (ALPP). We describe the residents and providers, comparing them across three facility types and other populations, to assess the characteristics and feasibility of this new approach.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We assessed ALPP residents and providers across seven Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We obtained information from medical records, assessment tools, and a provider survey.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We report here on 743 residents placed from 2002 to 2004. The Department of Veterans Affairs contracted with 58 adult family homes, 56 assisted living facilities, and 46 residential care facilities. The average ALPP resident was a 70-year-old unmarried White man referred from an inpatient hospital and living in a private residence prior to placement. Adult family homes enrolled residents requiring greater levels of assistance with activities of daily living than other facility types. Assisted living facilities were less likely than adult family homes to admit residents with functional disabilities and less likely than either adult family homes or adult residential care facilities to admit residents with certain care needs.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002ALPP placed residents with a wide range of characteristics in community facilities that varied widely in size and services. This information can help determine the role of this type of care in and outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of using a “wash-and-dry” toilet in the nursing home.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a controlled comparison baseline-versus-treatment design with 22 female nursing home residents aged 75 and older living in a 562-bed, not-for-profit nursing home facility in Maryland. The Luscence Luxury Lavage wash-and-dry toilet–bidet system was installed in the bathrooms of the experimental group. Measurements included staff and resident toilet experiences and toilet reaction questionnaires, utilization logs, Minimum Data Set information, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and urine cultures.\\u2003Results:\\u2002About half of the residents and staff members reported the toilet to have a positive effect on toileting. We saw a positive trend in resident affect for the experimental group that was not apparent for the comparison group. Nursing staff reported that the toilet functions did clean the residents, but that cleaning was not complete. Bacterial content of urine decreased in the experimental group and increased in the comparison group during the trial. Toilet installation was more complex than anticipated.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These results show that a wash-and-dry toilet shows promise for improved resident comfort in toileting and cleanliness, although further research is needed to verify the findings. Improved toilet design, design of nursing homes, and design of care activities would all improve the utility of these toilets in the nursing home population. Purpose:\\u2002As consensus emerges concerning the need to extend publicly funded home- and community-based services that support the independence of seniors, studies have reported the efficacy and cost effectiveness of assistive technology (AT). This article presents the latest available national AT expenditure and participation trends (1999–2002) for Medicaid 1915(c) waivers, the largest Medicaid home- and community-based service program.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We collected annually reported Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Form 372 data from state officials for each waiver providing AT for the period from 1999 to 2002. Descriptive statistics examined trends in national participation and expenditures, interstate variations in participation and expenditures, and differences in provision between elderly persons and persons with developmental disabilities. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Although we report a rise in the number of waivers providing AT, there has been much slower participant growth compared with the broader waiver program, and there is wide interstate variation in waiver AT provision. Not only do most waivers with AT serve persons with developmental disabilities, AT spending for that target group is almost twice that for aged or disabled waiver participants.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study highlights three policy concerns: first, the large interstate variations in AT provision in Medicaid waivers may signal access problems in some states; second, policy choices in some states may favor Medicaid spending on AT for the developmental disability population over that for the elderly population; and third, data limitations prevent a comparable state-by-state analysis of Medicare AT provision. Purpose: This study\\'s purpose was to better understand existing measures of quality of life in dementia residents of long-term care facilities. Design and Methods: We gathered data from 421 residents in 45 facilities. Analyses determined the psychometric properties of each measure, estimated the relationship between measures, and identified the extent to which resident characteristics predicted scores. Results: Most instruments had good to excellent dispersion and interrater reliability, and most scales had good to excellent internal consistency. Proxy measures tended to correlate best with each other, less well with observational measures, and least well with resident measures. Resident cognition and activities of daily living (ADLs) function were associated with most quality-of-life measures but predicted no more than a quarter of the observed variance in any measure. Implications: Various measures and sources of data provide different perspectives on quality of life. No “gold standard” exists; so a combination of methods and sources is likely to provide the most complete picture of quality of life. Purpose:\\u2002Our goal was to identify factors predictive of mammography rescreening within 18 months of baseline screening in multiethnic, low-income older women.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We interviewed a cross-sectional survey of staff of 102 randomly selected clinics that provided screening and diagnostic services. We also surveyed a random sample of 391 older women served by these clinics to retrospectively assess their experiences of the screening process.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We found that 59% of the sample returned for a repeat mammogram. Education level and the belief it is important to get an annual mammogram were significant patient-level predictors of rescreening. Offering pap smears and using hands-on demonstrations with breast models were significant clinic-level variables predictive of rescreening. Of note, among the variables that did not prove significant in the final model were those reflecting ethnicity and income.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Individual and health-care-delivery-system factors play important roles in the obtaining of regular mammograms by low-income women. These findings highlight the importance of both factors in improving rescreening rates among older women. Purpose: Our purpose in this study was to explore relationships between aspects of objective and perceived housing in five European samples of very old adults, as well as to investigate whether cross-national comparable patterns exist. Design and Methods: We utilized data from the first wave of the ENABLE–AGE Survey Study. The five national samples totalled 1,918 individuals aged 75 to 89 years. Objective assessments of the home environment covered the number of environmental barriers as well as the magnitude of accessibility problems (an aspect of person–environment fit). To assess perceptions of housing, we used instruments on usability, meaning of home, and housing satisfaction. We also assessed housing-related control. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, the results revealed that the magnitude of accessibility problems, rather than the number of physical environmental barriers, was associated with perceptions of activity-oriented aspects of housing. That is, very old people living in more accessible housing perceived their homes as more useful and meaningful in relation to their routines and everyday activities, and they were less dependent on external control in relation to their housing. The patterns of such relationships were similar in the five national samples. Implications: Objective and perceived aspects of housing have to be considered in order to understand the dynamics of aging in place, and the results can be used in practice contexts that target housing for senior citizens. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop a profile of sexual abuse cases among adults aged 60 and older receiving attention from Adult Protective Services units in Virginia over a 5-year period. Design and Methods: We used bivariate analysis to characterize older adults (n = 82) experiencing sexual abuse and the circumstances of the abuse. We used multiple correspondence analysis, a multivariate method, to explore relationships between characteristics of the older adults and the type of sexual abuse experienced. Results: Most victims of sexual abuse were women, between the ages of 70 and 89, residing in a nursing home. Typically, sexual abuse involved instances of sexualized kissing and fondling and unwelcome sexual interest in the person\\'s body. The majority of perpetrators were nursing home residents who were 60 years of age and older. In most situations, witnesses to the sexual abuse were facility residents. Implications: Orientation affects the invasiveness of the sexual abuse experienced by older adults. Our data reveal a small but persistent number of cases identifying individuals who are especially vulnerable to this form of abuse. These findings establish a baseline for future research and set the stage for further examination in both domestic and institutional settings as well as possible interventions and staff training. Purpose:\\u2002To compare disability rates resulting from several modes of survey administration in a single sample of frail elders.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using the same battery of six ADL questions we compared the resulting level of disability across several modes of administration: mail survey with telephone follow-up, in person interview, and evaluation by a registered nurse, further comparing self and proxy responses where both were available. We also created a crosswalk between these measures and clinical evaluations by rehabilitation therapists, allowing another point of comparison.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Disability rates varied substantially by mode of survey administration and all survey modes yielded lower rates of disability than those we derived from clinical assessments.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Relying on self-report in evaluating functional status may underestimate disability in clinical evaluations, level of care determinations and service planning. Researchers and policymakers should also take mode of administration effects into account when estimating or comparing disability rates. Purpose:\\u2002Our study identified factors common to a variety of populations and settings that may promote or inhibit uptake and adherence to falls-related interventions.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Semistructured interviews to assess perceived advantages and barriers to taking part in falls-related interventions were carried out in six European countries with 69 people aged 68 to 97 years. The sample was selected to include people with very different experiences of participation or nonparticipation in falls-related interventions, but all individuals were asked about interventions that included strength and balance training.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Attitudes were similar in all countries and contexts. People were motivated to participate in strength and balance training by a wide range of perceived benefits (interest and enjoyment, improved health, mood, and independence) and not just reduction of falling risk. Participation also was encouraged by a personal invitation from a health practitioner and social approval from family and friends. Barriers to participation included denial of falling risk, the belief that no additional falls-prevention measures were necessary, practical barriers to attendance at groups (e.g., transport, effort, and cost), and a dislike of group activities.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Because many older people reject the idea that they are at risk of falling, the uptake of strength and balance training programs may be promoted more effectively by maximizing and emphasizing their multiple positive benefits for health and well-being. A personal invitation from a health professional to participate is important, and it also may be helpful to provide home-based programs for those who dislike or find it difficult to attend groups. Purpose:\\u2002This study investigated direct and indirect effects of caregiver status on the physical health of Korean American caregivers in terms of caregiver coping styles and the quantity and the quality of informal social support.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using a sample of 87 caregivers and 87 matched noncaregivers, we analyzed a path model, employing both subjective (self-reported general health) and objective (blood pressure and cortisol levels) health indicators. For the intervening variables the path model employed coping styles and two aspects of social support (the quantity of informal social support and the quality of informal social support). \\u2003Results:\\u2002Our findings supported the association of caregiver status with poor health outcomes among Korean American caregivers. Of interest, the adverse effects of caregiver status on the physical health of caregivers were reported only with objective health markers (blood pressure and cortisol levels), not with subjective health indicators. The proposed indirect effects of caregiver status were supported only for cortisol levels, through the quality of informal social support.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The demonstration of the physical health effects of caregiving in one of the nation\\'s fastest growing ethnic groups, and the finding that these physiological effects occur without self-reported poor health, call attention to a potentially serious health problem in an understudied group providing family care to frail older family members. Purpose:\\u2002Sentence completion exercises require students to give open-ended responses to prompts. The first purpose of this article is to describe the method of sentence completion to assess middle-school children\\'s attitudes and beliefs about aging. The second purpose is to describe the patterns of characteristics that children associate with aging.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Two middle schools in San Antonio, TX agreed to have their students participate in the sentence completion exercises at the beginning of the 1998–1999 school year. Teachers asked students to write responses to the following prompts: “Old is …,” “You know you are old when …,” “You know your parents are old when …,” “When I am old, I …,” and “Old people ….” We coded the responses for their characteristics and whether they were positive, negative, or neutral. Results:\\u2002Of the 2,476 students, 1,874 (75.6%) wrote responses to at least one prompt. Overall, we collected 3,700 responses and coded 9,438 characteristics (2.6 characteristics per response). The most common characteristics of aging were having wrinkles (21.1%), having gray hair or being bald (20.0%), and being less active (17.5%). Students had a much more positive view of their future (55.4%) compared with their view of aging elicited by the other prompts (range of 4.9–25.7% positive responses). Students infrequently associated old age with specific conditions; only 4.6% mentioned diseases, 6.0% mentioned being ill or taking medications, and 5.7% mentioned sensory problems. Implications:\\u2002Middle-school students view their futures much more positively than the changes they observe in their parents and other elders. Students infrequently identified specific diseases or impairments as responsible for the changes they observe with aging. These observed responses provide a starting point for educators to develop and deliver gerontologically based materials that teach about healthful habits to maintain independence across a life span. Purpose: This 2-year, multisite, curriculum-development project aimed to increase the pool of professionals trained in geriatric and/or gerontological social work. Design and Methods: Our methods included (a) providing advanced training in aging, cultural competence, and interdisciplinary practice to social work professionals and masters degree students, (b) developing, implementing, and testing an innovative student curriculum based on standardized learning competencies identified by project participants, (c) revising the university curriculum to support such competencies, and (d) producing a practicum handbook. Results: The project achieved its out-comes. Implications: Project conceptualization, implementation, and evaluation are discussed together with approaches for its replication. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of childhood parental bonding on emotional distress experienced by primary caregiving sons for a parent with dementia. Design and Methods:Data from the 40 participants were obtained using the Parental Bonding Inventory (PBI), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and Caregiver Survey Questionnaire (CSQ). A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to investigate any main effects or interaction between the two PBI bonding variables (care and overprotection) and the two distress variables, the BSI\\'s Global Severity Index and the CSQ\\'s distress percentage. Results:Caregiving sons who identified more care in the childhood bond with their parent attributed less distress to their primary caregiver role. Sons reporting less care attributed more distress to the primary caregiver role. Implications: Results suggest that the parental bond developed during childhood may play a role in predicting the extent to which caregiving sons will attribute distress to their caregiving role. Purpose: This study examined response, participation, time, and costs for a telephone-administered survey to obtain comprehensive information on general health, eating habits, living environment, and functional status from a sample of older persons in a rural North Carolina county. Design and Methods: A probability sample of persons aged 60 years and older from the most recent electoral rolls were mailed a personalized letter, which was followed by telephone contact to recruit them into a contemporaneous survey that used a modified version of the Nutrition Screening Initiative\\'s Level I and II screens. Time requirements and costs associated with the completion of surveys were calculated. Results: Seventy-six percent of the persons contacted by telephone (residents of 96% of county precincts) completed the survey. Because minority elders were more likely to lack a working telephone, they were underrepresented in the sample. With 555 calling attempts (58% of surveys completed on first attempt), we estimated a cost of $10.65 per completed survey. Implications:Telephone-administered surveying of older adults may be considered as an appropriate component of an overall community-based service strategy. The estimation of the constituents of nutritional risk, by geographic area, economic status, or ethnicity, may aid in providing estimates of service needs and procuring and allocating resources. Additional methods of data collection are necessary in order to target older persons without telephone service. Purpose: Grief is an overlooked but important element of the caregiver experience. This study defines a model of caregiver grief to aid in clinical intervention and to support further research. Design and Methods: This study addressed the grief responses of 87 spouse and adult-child caregivers of patients with progressive dementia representing mild, moderate, severe, and postdeath. Questionnaire data and qualitative findings from 16 semistructured focus group interviews provide the basis for a descriptive model of anticipatory grief in dementia caregiving. Results: Significant differences emerged between spouse and adult-child caregiver groups as a whole and as a function of Clinical Dementia Rating impairment level. Caregiver grief was found to fluctuate between intellectual, affective, and existential poles depending upon current care demands and expectations. Implications: These findings suggest that anticipatory grief in dementia caregiving is \"real\" grief, equivalent in intensity and breadth to death-related grief. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports on a study to identify “building blocks” for quality report cards for geriatric care. Its aim is to present (a) the results of the study and (b) the innovative step-by-step approach that was developed to arrive at these results.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used Concept Mapping/Structured Conceptualization to define the building blocks. Applied to this study, we carried out Concept Mapping using several data collection methods: (a) a Web search, (b) semistructured interviews, (c) document analysis, (d) questionnaires, and (e) focus groups.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The findings showed that, although home care and institutional care for elderly adults share many quality themes, experts need to develop separate quality report cards for the two types of geriatric care. Home care consumers attach more value to the availability, continuity, and reliability of care, whereas consumers of institutional care value privacy, respect, and autonomy most. This study also showed, unlike many other quality report card studies, that consumers want information on structure, process and outcome indicators, and rating outcome indicators such as effectiveness and safety of care both for home care and for institutional care. Concept Mapping proved to be a valuable method for developing quality report cards in health care.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Building blocks were delivered for two quality report cards for geriatric care and will be used when quality report cards are built in The Netherlands. For the U.S. context, this study shows that current national report cards for geriatric care should be supplemented with quality-of-life data. Purpose:\\u2002The study describes Oregon state policy and supply developments for licensed long-term-care settings, particularly apartment-style assisted living facilities and more traditional residential care facilities.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data came from a variety of sources, including state agency administrative records, other secondary data sources, and key informant interviews. Descriptive statistics examined public financing, Medicaid reimbursement, and licensed bed supply trends from 1986 to 2004, as well as Medicaid resident use between 1990 and 2004.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Residential care expansion, combined with nursing facility contraction, has transformed Oregon\\'s supply of licensed long-term-care settings in favor of less institutional options. State financing, reimbursement, and licensing policies varied across provider type, with greater public resources supporting growth of assisted living facilities. By 2004, such settings were more likely to be Medicaid providers than residential care facilities and had a higher proportion of Medicaid residents relative to available bed supply.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002State financing and reimbursement policies may play a role in stimulating the supply of apartment-style assisted living available to low-income and/or rural service users. Less favorable policy conditions may have unintended consequences for the supply and use of other residential care settings. Purpose:\\u2002It is widely believed that physical restraint use causes mental and physical health decline in nursing home residents. Yet few studies exist showing an association between restraint initiation and health decline. In this research, we examined whether physical restraint initiation is associated with subsequent lower physical or mental health.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used all nursing homes (N = 740) in Pennsylvania in 2001, with 12,820 residents. We used the Minimum Data Set data; Online Survey, Certification and Reporting data; and the Area Resource File as data sources. We restricted our sample to newly admitted nursing home residents who were not restrained in the first two quarters of their residency. We examined which facility and individual characteristics during those first two quarters were associated with restraint initiation during the third quarter. We then examined the association of third-quarter restraint initiation with fourth-quarter health outcomes, using regressions that controlled for first- and second-quarter health status as well as other resident, facility, and market characteristics. The physical health outcomes examined consisted of falls, walking dependence, activities of daily living (ADLs), pressure ulcers, and contractures. Mental health outcomes examined consisted of cognitive performance, depression, and behavior problems. Results:\\u2002The initiation of restraint use was associated with a previous fall (p <.01), psychoactive medication use (p <.05), low cognition (p <.01), ADL scores (p <.01), and the absence of pressure ulcers (p <.10), as well as a variety of facility characteristics. Subsequent to restraint initiation, we found an association with lower cognitive performance (p <.01), lower ADL performance (p <.01), and higher walking dependence (p <.01).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We found that an association between restraint initiation and subsequent adverse health consequences exists and is substantial. Moreover, these results would appear to have practical as well as statistical significance. The use of interventions claiming to prevent, retard, or reverse aging is proliferating. Some of these interventions can seriously harm older persons and aging baby boomers who consume them. Others that are merely ineffective may divert patients from participating in beneficial regimens and also cause them economic harm. “Free market regulation” does not seem to weed out risky, ineffective, and fraudulent anti-aging treatments and products. Public health messages, apparently, are having little effect. What more can be done to achieve better protection for older consumers? An analysis of the potential for federal and state action reveals many barriers to effective governmental regulation of anti-aging interventions. In view of dim prospects for stronger public regulation, physicians and other professionals—especially geriatricians and gerontologists—will need to be more aggressive in protecting older consumers. In particular, The Gerontological Society of America and the American Geriatrics Society should undertake a sustained program of specific educational efforts, directed at health professionals and the general public, in which they sort out as best they can the helpful, the harmful, the fraudulent, and the harmless anti-aging practices and products. Scholars have debated the legitimacy of gerontology as a discipline since Metchnikoff coined the term more than 100 years ago. Recent developments such as the emergence of interdisciplinary aging theories and consensus on longitudinal research methods suggest that gerontology is materializing as a unique discipline, rather than a subset of another more established disciplinary tradition. In this article we review substantive evidence from gerontological theory and scholarship to suggest orienting principles for the emerging discipline of gerontology. We offer a conceptual framework of gerontology as a discipline that integrates contributions of biopsychosocial perspectives with well-established concepts of age, aging, and aged and multiple contextual elements. We conclude with a discussion of how our model relates to gerontology\\'s progress, including examples of successful interdisciplinary research, and offer questions for gerontologists to consider for further advancement of the field. Purpose:\\u2002Early identification of elder abuse requires a valid, easily administered screening instrument. This study examined the reliability and validity of the Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale (VASS), a 12-item self-report measure with four factors (Vulnerability, Dependence, Dejection, and Coercion).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The sample consisted of 10,421 nationally representative Women\\'s Health Australia study participants, aged 73–78, who completed the Time 2 postal survey in 1999. We tested validity of the VASS factor structure and whether baseline risk status independently predicted Time 2 attrition. Results:\\u2002Findings confirmed the VASS factor structure and construct validity. Four factors explained 51% of variance, and these factors were internally consistent. The Vulnerability and Coercion factors held the strongest face and construct validity for physical and psychological abuse. The Dependence and Dejection factors were valid and reliable and significantly predicted 3-year attrition after controlling for confounders.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Further work is needed to determine sensitivity and specificity of VASS as a screening instrument for elder abuse. Qualitative research could examine specific experiences and contexts of vulnerable women. Purpose: The goal of our study was to identify a representative sample of direct care aides to generate an accurate profile of the long-term-care workforce, with a special focus on home care workers. Design and Methods: Data were taken from the 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 2000 Census. Results: Variable coding in the 2000 Census data allowed for a more detailed identification of long-term-care workers than was available in previous studies. On the basis of this new sample, the estimated size of the home care workforce is much larger than that in previous estimates, and it is more heterogeneous. In addition, our analyses revealed more self-employed workers, higher salaries than previously reported, and greater ethnic diversity, with Hispanics or Latinos comprising a significant proportion of the home care workforce. Implications: Numerous state and federal programs are currently underway to increase the capacity of the long-term-care workforce. A more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of the long-term-care workforce will facilitate more effective development of programs designed to enhance recruitment and retention of these workers to meet the increasing demands of future years. Purpose: The relationship between job satisfaction of nurse aides and intent to leave and actual turnover after 1 year is examined. Design and Methods: Data came from a random sample of 72 nursing homes from 5 states (Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New York, and Oregon). From these nursing homes, we collected 1,779 surveys from nurse aides (a response rate of 62%). We used a job satisfaction instrument specifically developed for use with nurse aides, as well as previously validated measures of intent to leave and turnover. We used ordered logistic regression and logistic regression to examine the data. \\u2003Results:\\u2002High overall job satisfaction was associated with low scores on thinking about leaving, thinking about a job search, searching for a job, and turnover. In examining the association between the job satisfaction subscales and intent to leave and turnover, we found that high Work Schedule subscale scores, high Training subscale scores, and high Rewards subscale scores were associated with low scores on thinking about leaving, thinking about a job search, searching for a job, and turnover. High scores on the Quality of Care subscale were associated with low turnover after 1 year. Implications: These results are important in clearly showing the relationship between job satisfaction and intent to leave and turnover of nurse aides. Training, rewards, and workload are particularly important aspects of nurse aides\\' jobs. Purpose:\\u2002The identification of nursing home residents who can continue to participate in advance care planning about end-of-life care is a critical clinical and bioethical issue. This study uses high quality observational research to identify correlates of advance care planning in nursing homes, including objective measurement of capacity.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The authors used cross-sectional, cohort study between 1997 and 1999. Seventy-eight residents (M age = 83.97, SD = 8.2) and their proxies (M age = 59.23, SD = 11.77) were included across five nursing homes. The authors obtained data via chart review, proxy interviews, resident assessments, survey completion by certified nursing assistants, and direct observation of residents\\' daily behaviors.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Capacity assessments revealed that most residents could state a simple treatment preference (82.4%), but a sizable number did not retain capacity to understand treatment alternatives or appreciate the consequences of their choice. Global cognitive ability (Mini-Mental State Examination score) was related to understanding and appreciation. When the authors removed the effects of global cognitive ability, understanding and appreciation were related to time spent by residents in verbal interaction with others. Residents were more likely to possess advance directives when proxies possessed advance directives, proxies were less religious, and residents were socially engaged.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Assessment of proxy beliefs and direct determination of residents\\' decisional capacity and social engagement may help nursing home staff identify families who may participate in advance planning for end-of-life medical care. Measures of global cognitive ability offer limited information about resident capacity for decision making. Decisional capacity assessments should enhance the verbal ability of individuals with dementia by reducing reliance on memory in the assessment process. Interventions to engage residents and families in structured discussions for end-of-life planning are needed. Purpose:Few international comparisons of health services are performed using microlevel data. Using such data, this paper compares the need for and receipt of assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) in comparable samples in the United States and Sweden, a country with a universal system of community-based services.Design and Methods: Data from national surveys of community residents completed at approximately the same time in each nation are used to create comparable measures of need and assistance. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses compare need and assistance patterns across the nations and identify individual factors that explain receipt of assistance and unmet needs.Results:Our results indicate that a simple story of greater use of paid formal services in Sweden and more unpaid informal use in the United States masks a more complex relationship. Assistance with ADLs seems to be more targeted in Sweden; narrow differences in assistance widen considerably when the analysis is limited to those reporting need. Implications:Although these two different health systems result in similar levels of overall ADL assistance, a detailed microlevel comparison reveals key distinctions. Further microlevel comparisons of access, cost, and quality in cross-national data can further aid our understanding of the consequences of health policy. Purpose: We investigated whether health status (i.e., need characteristics) and financial resources (i.e., enabling characteristics) were important predictors of two types of functional adaptations among elderly adults: home modifications such as putting nonslip tape on rugs or installing more telephones and use of equipment for mobility or activities of daily living (ADLs) such as canes or walkers. Design and Methods: Participants were identified from the National Survey of Self-Care and Aging (n = 3,485), a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged 65 and older. Need and enabling characteristics were used to predict home modifications and equipment use in multinomial logistic analysis, controlling for predisposing characteristics. Results: Although several health-status (need) variables had significant, direct effects on functional adaptations, the effects of ADL limitations were diminished at higher levels of impairment. Among the financial (enabling) variables, subjective income measures and supplemental insurance had significant, direct effects on functional adaptations. Implications: Promotion of functional adaptations among elderly people may benefit from both a proactive approach that targets elders with few limitations and a consideration of financial factors in addition to health status. Purpose: A community and faith-based intervention with elderly persons and their adult children involving religious, medical, and academic communities is described. Design and Methods: Lifestyle changes and individual and corporate forms of spirituality were affirmed using an expanded Rowe and Kahn model of successful aging. Faculty from academic, medical, state, and religious institutions presented a variety of workshops at a multichurch-sponsored conference that hosted over 500 seniors. Results: Postconference surveys suggested extremely favorable satisfaction rates across all groups represented. The African American religious community provided critical leadership in achieving an excellent African American participation rate. Implications: The model described has the capacity to generate collaborations across denominational, racial, and class barriers, and has the potential of helping to unify the religious community around the important task of promoting successful aging. Purpose: This article reports the findings of a study, undertaken in 2000, whose purpose was to gather information about the experiences and realities of gay and lesbian seniors and their families from across Canada in accessing a broad range of health and social services in the community, and to examine the role of health care and social service organizations in shaping access and service delivery.Design and Methods: This study used a qualitative exploratory design based on focus group interviews. Perspectives of older gay men and lesbians and their families involved in organizations addressing these issues, as well as professionals from both gay and lesbian health organizations and mainstream elder care organizations were sought.Results: Specific reference was made to the impact of discrimination on the health and access to health services of these populations. Issues relating to invisibility, historic and current barriers to care, and the nature of service options are identified.Implications: Recommendations for change are highlighted, including those related to best practice programs and policies in the long-term care sector. Purpose: This study traces the implementation of the second-generation Social HMO demonstration program within the Health Plan of Nevada among more than 35,000 Las Vegas members. Design and Methods: This case study uses health plan reports, claims data, and administrator and clinician interviews covering the years 1999–2001. Results: Care coordination, geriatric services, communications, and support infrastructure development has been extensive. Implementation has occurred at different rates among staff model and network practice physicians. Hospital days and discharges were fewer among clinic than network participants; physician and emergency room visits were more frequent, as were day care, respite care, and home help. Implications: Integrating medical and social care is difficult. Despite great efforts, it took several years before key benefits could be adequately developed and linkages created. Evaluations that target start-up rather than steady-state operation may not capture these accomplishments. Further, federal government efforts to encourage experimentation and innovation in care for aged and disabled individuals may require programs other than time-limited demonstrations. Purpose: The goal of this study was to evaluate the practice-oriented model of service use ( Yeatts, Crow, & Folts, 1992) relative to the more widely used behavioral model ( Andersen, 1968) in its ability to explain the use of respite services by caregivers of Alzheimer\\'s patients. Unlike the behavioral model, which focuses primarily on characteristics of the service user, the practice-oriented model focuses primarily on characteristics of the service.Design and Methods:Interview data from 1,158 caregivers participating in the Alzheimer\\'s Disease Demonstration Grants to States program ( Montgomery, Kosloski, Karner, & Schaefer, 2002) were analyzed. Separate regression models were estimated for adult day care and in-home respite, using the full information maximum likelihood procedure described by Arbuckle (1996), and ordinary least squares regression with listwise deletion of missing data.Results:The findings indicate that the factors related to respite use tapped by the practice-oriented model add significantly to explanatory models of service use over models that use only the factors typically represented by the behavioral model. Additional analyses, including a set of interactions with ethnicity, indicated that this improvement occurs primarily for White and Hispanic caregivers, and less so for African Americans.Implications:The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for enhancing the timely use of respite services and directions for future research. Purpose:\\u2002We test the efficacy of an intervention based on the transtheoretical model to increase the intake of fruits and vegetables and to describe differences in psychosocial variables based on the achievement of the 5 A Day Program target.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-month fruit and vegetable intervention to a control condition with a 12-month follow-up. Participants included 1,277 community-residing persons who were 60 years of age or older; 834 provided dietary data at all three time points and are included in our outcome analyses.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The intervention group increased intake by 0.5 to 1.0 serving more than the control group over 24 months as measured by the NCI Fruit and Vegetable Screener and the 5 A Day Program screener. The majority of the participants (58%) perceived that they maintained 5 or more servings per day for 24 months. These maintainers had a higher intake at each time point for all dietary measures and differed from those who failed to progress (11%) for most transtheoretical model variables.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The intervention was effective in increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables in older adults. Those who maintained their level of perceived intake as 5 or more servings per day consumed 2–4 servings per day more than those who failed to progress. Purpose: Previous research in specific locales indicates that individuals admitted to rural nursing homes have lower care needs than individuals admitted to nursing homes in urban areas, and that rural nursing homes differ in their mix of short-stay and chronic-care residents. This research investigates whether differences in acuity are a function of differences in resident payer status and occur for both individuals admitted for short stays, with Medicare as payer, and those needing chronic care. Design and Methods: We used a representative 10% sample of national resident assessments (Minimum Data Set) for calendar year 2000 (N = 197,589). We conducted statistical analyses (means, percentages, and logistic regression) to investigate differences in Medicare and non-Medicare admissions to facilities in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Results: Non-Medicare residents admitted to rural nursing facilities have lower acuity scores than non-Medicare residents admitted to metropolitan nursing homes. However, individuals admitted under Medicare were similar in rural and urban areas. Implications: Differences in resident acuity at admission among facilities in different locales were largely a function of lower acuity levels for individuals admitted to rural nursing homes for long-term or chronic care, although differences in Medicare census also played some role in facility-level differences in acuity. Other factors must be explored to determine why this lower acuity occurs and whether higher use of rural nursing homes by less impaired older persons meets their needs and preferences and represents good public policy. Purpose:\\u2002Informal family caregivers are increasingly recognized as critical for meeting the needs of individuals with chronic diseases associated with aging. This study examined race and gender differences in perceived informal caregiver availability for participants aged 45 and older in a large national epidemiological study.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Cross-sectional data were collected in structured telephone interviews from 32,999 participants from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Participants were asked if they believed that someone was available to provide care for them in the event of a serious illness or disability and, if so, to describe that person.\\u2003Results:\\u2002More than 80% of the participants reported having an available caregiver. Variables associated with lower perceived caregiver availability from a multivariable logistic regression analysis included being female, White, or unmarried; living alone; being older than 85; and having worse self-rated health. Spouses were the most likely caregivers for all racial and gender groups except for African American women, who identified daughters as the most likely caregivers. African American women also showed the smallest differential in perceived caregiver availability between married and unmarried (82.8% vs 75.7%), whereas White men showed the largest differential (90.9% vs 60.4%).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Most individuals believe they have an informal caregiver available to them, but certain factors increase the risk of reporting no available caregiver. Increased efforts are needed to anticipate future caregiving needs, particularly for individuals who perceive a lack of available informal caregivers and may require more formal care services. Purpose:\\u2002Since the 1980s, Ohio counties have pursued a somewhat unique strategy for funding services for the 60-and-older population. Using local property-tax levies, Ohio counties bring in more than $100 million yearly to support a range of services for older people. In this article we report on information from the 2005 Ohio Senior Service Levy Survey, including information for states or counties that may be interested in implementing senior-service levies of their own.\\u2003Design and Methods:A survey was completed by 56 of 59 Ohio counties that operated senior-service levies in 2004. We pilot tested the survey instrument with input from three counties (urban, rural, and a mix of both).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, the survey responses provided information on a range of components, including size of levy, types of services provided, number of older citizens served, quality and evaluation efforts, and advice on initiating successful levy campaigns.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Ohio is one of only five states raising money for senior services through countywide, property-tax levies. Although there is some debate about the appropriateness of property-tax levies as a means of funding senior services, these levies are being met very favorably at the polls in Ohio. Because funding from the Older Americans Act has not kept pace with inflation or with the increasing number of older people, other states may look at Ohio\\'s experience with senior-service levies with increasing interest. Purpose: Enabling valuable research findings to be used by the field requires a strategic approach to dissemination and utilization rather than simply making constituencies aware of the information. This article describes a conceptual framework for the dissemination and utilization of information, along with examples of its use by the Boston University Roybal Center for Enhancement of Late Life Function. Design and Methods:\\u2002The framework identifies dissemination/utilization goals of exposure, experience, expertise, and embedding (“4 E”) and relates each goal to strategies targeted for specific users. Results and Implications:\\u2002The Boston University center exposed the field to information through presentations, print- and Web-based information, provided consumers and family members with new findings through motivational videotapes, developed expertise-level training programs, and embedded the new findings within organizations and systems. The 4 E framework can translate critical research outcomes into useful information to assist the field to better care and support available for individuals in late life. Purpose:\\u2002The disproportionately high burden of morbidity and mortality among older African Americans is due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the factors contributing to these outcomes. In order to more fully understand the factors that contribute to African American morbidity and mortality, researchers must identify strategies for increasing the inclusion of older African Americans in research on social and health phenomena.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This article is a process evaluation describing the successes and challenges associated with recruitment of older African Americans into research. It considers an effort to nurture collaboration between university and community institutions to both facilitate research endeavors and offer meaningful and culturally-appropriate contributions to the community.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The primary challenges discovered in this observational process evaluation of a church-based recruitment strategy include the effective coordination of a community research advisory board, ensuring participant autonomy, and reducing concerns of exploitation among potential participants.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A strategy of coordinating a community research advisory board to incorporate the views of community members and to drive a church-based recruitment procedure provides a starting point for tapping into an immensely important segment of society historically ignored by the research community. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to evaluate WIN A STEP UP, a workforce development program for nursing assistants (NAs) in nursing homes (NHs) involving continuing education by onsite trainers, compensation for education modules, supervisory skills training of frontline supervisors, and short-term retention contracts for bonuses and/or wage increases upon completion.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We collected longitudinal semistructured interview and survey data from NAs, supervisors, and managers at 8 program NHs and 10 comparison NHs. To control for selection bias, we matched 77 NA program participants to 81 participating site and 135 comparison site controls using propensity scores in a quasi-experimental design supplemented by qualitative assessments. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Managers at seven of eight participating NHs wanted to repeat the program. At 3 months after baseline, participants differed from controls by having (a) more improved nursing care and supportive leadership scores, (b) greater improvement in team care, and (c) stronger ratings of career and financial rewards. Nurse supervisors participating in supervisory skills training reported positive changes in management practices for themselves and peers. Modest 3-month turnover reductions occurred in six settings where the program was fully implemented without incident.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Managers\\', supervisors\\', and participating NAs\\' consistent perceptions of improved quality of care and job quality, along with a promise of increased retention, suggest that interventions like WIN A STEP UP are beneficial. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of baseline network type and 7-year mortality risk in later life. Design and Methods: We executed secondary analysis of all-cause mortality in Israel using data from a 1997 national survey of adults aged 60 and older (N = 5,055) that was linked to records from the National Death Registry up to 2004. We considered six network types—diverse, friend focused, neighbor focused, family focused, community–clan, and restricted—in the analysis, controlling for population group, sociodemographic background, and health factors. We carried out Cox proportional hazards regressions for the entire sample and separately by age group at baseline: 60–69, 70–79, and 80 and older. \\u2002Results:\\u2002Network types were associated with mortality in the 70–79 and 80 and older age groups. Respondents located in diverse and friend-focused network types, and to a lesser degree those located in community–clan network types, had a lower risk of mortality compared to individuals belonging to restricted networks. Implications: Gerontological practitioners should address older adults\\' social networks in their assessments of clients. The parameters used to derive network types in this study can serve toward the development of practical network type inventories. Moreover, practitioners should tailor the interventions they implement to the different network types in which their elderly clients are embedded. Purpose:\\u2002We explored cross-cultural similarities and differences in minority family caregivers\\' perceptions of the onset and diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease in their relatives, with specific attention to clinical encounters. Design and Methods: We performed a meta-synthesis of three qualitative studies conducted in Massachusetts with 22 African American, Latino, and Chinese caregivers. Results: All participants conveyed striking similarities of thought about normalization of cognitive symptoms until one critical event, usually relocation, precipitated family awareness that an elder\\'s behavior was not the result of “normal aging.” A lack of knowledge about Alzheimer\\'s disease, rather than culturally influenced beliefs, was the major deterrent to having an elder\\'s memory assessed. Community physicians\\' failure to recognize Alzheimer\\'s disease or refer to specialists was more problematic than language or ethnic differences. Physicians\\' disrespect for caregivers\\' concerns about memory loss was particularly noted by African Americans, stigmatization of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease was noted by Chinese, and fears that acculturation would end family home care was noted by Latinos. Implications: Amid ethnocultural differences, there are many similarities in needs that offer providers the possibility to unify quality improvements in Alzheimer\\'s disease outreach, education, and physicians\\' services. Suggestions include providing the public with more confidential access to Alzheimer\\'s disease information, increasing dementia awareness among community physicians, motivating clinicians to adopt culturally sensitive communication patterns, and providing community education to reduce normalization by families and stigmatization of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Purpose:\\u2002This study addresses the question of how the relation between self-rated health (SRH) and mortality differs between genders. In addition to the general question, four specific concepts of SRH are distinguished: SRH in comparison with age peers, SRH in comparison with one\\'s own health 10 years ago, and current and future health perceptions. For these concepts, the gender-specific risks of mortality were evaluated for a short and a longer follow-up period.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Baseline and mortality data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (N = 1917, initial ages 55–85 years) were used. Mortality risks were evaluated in Cox regression models at 3 and 7.5 years of follow-up, both adjusted for age and for sociodemographic characteristics, indicators of functional and mental health, lifestyle, and social involvement. All SRH measures were scaled from 1 (positive) to 5 (negative). Results:\\u2002Baseline correlations between SRH concepts were similar for men and women. After 3 years, 12% of the men and 7% of the women had died; after 7.5 years, these percentages were 27 and 15, respectively. In fully adjusted models, current health perceptions predicted 3-year mortality in men (risk ratio of 1.33). At 7.5 years, mortality in men was predicted by current health perceptions and by SRH compared with age peers (risk ratios of 1.25 and 1.23, respectively). In women, no SRH concept predicted either 3-year or 7.5-year mortality.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002SRH was a predictor of mortality only in men, not in women. The gender difference showed most clearly at longer follow-up, in the SRH concept “comparison with age peers.” The Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock is addressing one of the most pressing policy issues facing the United States: how to care for the burgeoning number of older adults. In 2001, the Institute created the Arkansas Aging Initiative, which established seven satellite centers on aging across the state using $1.3 to $2 million dollars annually from the state\\'s portion of the Master Tobacco Settlement. These centers on aging assist the state\\'s population of older adults, many of whom reside in rural areas, live in poverty, and suffer from poor health. The centers provide multiple avenues of education for the community, health care providers, families, and caregivers. The Arkansas Aging Initiative, in partnership with local hospitals, also makes geriatric primary and specialty care more accessible through senior health clinics established across rural Arkansas. In 2005, older adults made more than 36,000 visits to these clinics. All sites have attracted at least one physician who holds a Certificate of Added Qualifications in geriatrics and one advanced practice nurse. Other team members include geriatric medical social workers, pharmacists, nutritionists, and neuropsychologists. This initiative also addresses other policy issues, including engaging communities in building partnerships and programs crucial to maximizing their limited resources and identifying opportunities to change reimbursement mechanisms for care provided to the growing number of older adults. We believe this type of program has the potential to create a novel paradigm for nationwide implementation. Purpose: The ethical and practical issues in disclosing a dementia diagnosis remain subjects of some debate. In this review of the literature we document previous opinion and practice in the area of diagnostic disclosure. Design and Methods: We identified sources for this review with a MEDLINE and PsycINFO database search, followed by collection of additional articles from reference lists. Results: Across sources we were able to identify a broad list of arguments both for and against diagnostic disclosure. We briefly discuss some of the ethical principles that undergird those reasons. Implications: Practice guidelines and professional opinion regarding disclosure appear to depart from the actual experience reported by clinicians, patients, and family members. At a more detailed level, process issues in disclosure, such as who is told, how and what they are told, and the impact of disclosure, are poorly understood. Sensitivity to individual differences may promote an optimal approach to disclosure. Research in this area is sparse and often contradictory, and throughout the review we propose research questions that, when answered, could clarify issues in disclosure that are essential to sound dementia care. The goals of this study were to develop a valid, reliable measure of lifetime religious and spiritual experience and to assess its value in explaining late-life health. Procedures included semi-structured interviews with Duke Aging Center volunteers (n = 30), followed by structured interviews of a stratified, random sample of subjects (n = 157) from the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly at Duke University. Principal components analysis suggested four factors with favorable psychometrics. Health-impaired subjects reported a history of seeking/receiving divine aid (God Helped). At every level of impairment, Lifetime Religious Social Support and current religious attendance were positively correlated. Regardless of current attendance, subjects who reported higher Lifetime Religious Social Support received more instrumental social support. Healthy behaviors were associated with both God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support. Cost of Religiousness predicted depressive symptoms and impaired social support. Family History of Religiousness was unrelated to late-life health. Evaluation of the Spiritual History Scale in Four Dimensions (SHS-4) across geographical settings, cultural subgroups, age cohorts, and clinical samples is warranted. Purpose:\\u2002Previous research on nursing home resident quality of life (QOL) has mainly been cross-sectional. This study examined the association between changes in QOL and changes in resident clinical factors.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A longitudinal study of resident QOL was conducted in two nursing homes. Self-report interviews using a multidimensional measure of QOL were linked with clinical data from the Minimum Data Set. Five waves of interviews were conducted at 6-month intervals.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Residents with one or more Stage II or higher pressure ulcers for two consecutive 6-month periods reported declines in autonomy, security, and spiritual well-being QOL domains; those with declines in physical disability reported declines in the dignity domain. Increases in depressive symptoms were associated with decreases in comfort, meaningful activities, and food enjoyment domains, and increases in pain were associated with decreases in functional competence and dignity domains.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002There is evidence of an association between physical health and self-reported QOL. However, not every dimension of QOL exhibited the same pattern. Further research is needed on the link between specific clinical factors and aspects of QOL. Purpose: This is the second article reporting a project that (a) characterized the longitudinal functional patterns of residents in an affordable, assisted living housing (ALH) milieu for low-income people and (b) compared the ALH residents\\' functional patterns with those for similarly low-income, community-dwelling people. Design and Methods: Functioning was defined as the ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living and respondents\\' competing risks such as death and institutionalization. The comparison samples were selected from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study. The analyses involved description of functional patterns and multinomial logit models to assess the relative likelihood that study participants experienced each pattern of functioning and competing risks. Results: About 42.4% of the ALH residents had stable high functioning, 32.9% deteriorated (e.g., had increased impairment, institutionalization, death), 3% improved in functioning, 6% exhibited moderate to severe impairment throughout the study, and the remainder returned to the community. Comparison of the ALH residents\\' functional patterns with those of the community-dwelling respondents indicated that the ALH residents\\' patterns generally were similar and in some ways better, adjusting for social–demographic factors and health; for example, the ALH residents were no different (statistically) in terms of improvement, decline, and death, but they were more likely to have stable high functioning. Implications: The results suggest that the affordable ALH milieu enabled low-income residents to maintain function or cope well with functional decline. The comparison with community-dwelling participants provides evidence that the affordable ALH milieu was comparatively beneficial. Purpose:\\u2002In an attempt to more thoroughly describe aggressive behavior in nursing home residents with dementia, we examined background and proximal factors as guided by the Need-Driven Dementia-Compromised Behavior model.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a multivariate cross-sectional survey with repeated measures; participants resided in nine randomly selected nursing homes within four midwestern counties. The Minimum Data Set (with verification by caregivers) identified participants. We used a disproportionate probability sample of 107 participants (51% with a history of aggressive behavior) to ensure variability. Videotaped care events included four of direct care (shower baths, meals, dressing, and undressing) and two of nondirect care (two randomly selected 20-minute time periods in the afternoon and evening). The majority of participants (75%) received three shower baths, for a total of 282 videotaped baths.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Because the shower bath was the only care event significantly related to aggressive behavior (F = 6.9, p <.001), only those data are presented. Multilevel statistical modeling identified background factors (gender, mental status score, and lifelong history of less agreeableness) and a proximal factor (amount of nighttime sleep) as significant predictors (p <.05) of aggressive behavior during the shower bath. We found significant correlations between aggressive behavior and negative subject affect (r =.27) during the bath, and aggressive behavior and lifetime agreeableness level (r = −.192). We also found significant correlations between mental status and the amount of education (r =.212), and between negative caregiver affect and negative participant affect (r =.321).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We identified three background and one proximal factor as significant risk factors for aggressive behavior in dementia. Data identify not only those persons most at risk for aggressive behavior during care, but also the care event most associated with aggressive behavior. Together these data inform both caregiving for persons with dementia as well as the design of intervention studies for aggressive behavior in dementia. Purpose:We describe the impact of two interventions, a consumer-directed voucher for in-home supportive services and a chronic disease self-management–health-promotion nurse intervention, on the probability of use of two types of home care—skilled home health care and personal assistance services—received by functionally impaired Medicare beneficiaries. Design and Methods: The Medicare Primary and Consumer-Directed Care Demonstration was a randomized controlled trial in 19 counties in New York, West Virginia, and Ohio with four groups: disease-management–health-promotion nurse, consumer-directed voucher, combination (nurse plus voucher), and control. We estimated a bivariate probit model for the 1,394 individuals aged 65 or older who had no private long-term-care insurance. Results: Whereas the nurse intervention alone had no effect on the probability of using either type of home care, the voucher alone increased the probability of personal assistance services use by 13% (p =.002) but not that of skilled home health care use. The combination of the two interventions increased the probability of personal assistance services use by 18% (p <.001). Implications: The implementation of disease-management–health-promotion nurse interventions should not lead to a greater probability of skilled home health care or personal assistance services use, whereas the provision of consumer-directed vouchers should result in an increased probability of personal assistance services use, as intended. Purpose: The formal–informal dichotomy of home care, which has been a theoretical framework in quantitative and qualitative research, might not be descriptive of older persons\\' views about their home-care providers. This qualitative study explores the perspectives of older women about the characteristics of their home-care providers. Design and Methods: Three interviews were conducted with each of 25 women (aged 80–94 years) during the first 4 months of participation in a 3-year phenomenological study. The women described their helpers. We differentiated helper types on the basis of the nature of the help, and we explored variations in compensation arrangements. Results: We delineated a new typology of home-care helpers: regular helpers, on-call helpers, can-will doers, and mainstays. Implications: When home-care helpers are categorized by type of assistance provided, the potential value of their efforts is more evident. The association of formal care with paid help and informal care with nonpaid help limits the effectiveness of the dichotomy as a basis for home-care-payment policies. The new home-care-helper typology cuts across the dimensions of the dichotomy, providing an alternative theoretical framework for further research. Purpose: This article describes the pattern of change in home-care use and expenditures, the distribution of payments by source, and the mix of skilled versus nonskilled services before and after 1996. Design and Methods: The analysis is based on tabulations of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1996, 1998, and 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Estimates are weighted to represent the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Results: After increasing dramatically between 1987 and 1996, formal home-care use and expenditures fell between 1996 and 1999. The decline was largely due to a decrease in funding under Medicare, which coincided with changes initiated in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Declines in total spending were attenuated by increases in expenditures under state and local programs. After the BBA, fewer skilled services were provided to the elderly population and more unskilled services were provided to the nonelderly population. Implications: These findings highlight the increasing role of state governments in funding home care after the BBA. However, more recent pressure on state budgets and the institution of prospective payment under Medicare for home care may alter these trends. Purpose: \\u2002This study assessed the extent of different types of abuse, repeated and multiple abuse experiences among women aged 60 and older, and their effects on the women\\'s self-reported health. Design and Methods:\\u2002 A cross-sectional study of a clinical sample of 842 community-dwelling women aged 60 and older completed a telephone survey about type and frequency of abuse, self-reported health status and health conditions, and demographic characteristics. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS 11.5 and STATA 7.0. Results:\\u2002 Nearly half of the women had experienced at least one type of abuse—psychological/emotional, control, threat, physical, or sexual—since turning 55 years old. Sizable proportions were victims of repeat abuse. Many women experienced multiple types of abuse and experienced abuse often. Abused older women were significantly more likely to report more health conditions than those who were not abused. Women who experienced psychological/emotional abuse—alone, repeatedly, or with other types of abuse—had significantly increased odds of reporting bone or joint problems, digestive problems, depression or anxiety, chronic pain, and high blood pressure or heart problems. Implications:\\u2002 It is important that health care and service providers acknowledge psychological/emotional, control, threat, physical, and sexual abuse against older women and understand their health implications. In addition, it is important for providers to be trained in both aging and domestic violence services and resources. This article describes the prevalence, assessment, and treatment of pain, as well as characteristics associated with pain, in 331 residents with dementia in 45 assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Overall, 21% of residents had pain, and pain was more commonly reported in for-profit facilities, and for those receiving professional assessment and treatment. Purpose: Altering negative attitudes associated with ageism may be possible by giving people accurate information about older people in conjunction with reinforcement for change. Design and Methods: Ninety-nine college students (35 men, 63 women; mean age = 20 years, SD = 2.78) participated in one of three groups: information only, information plus an innocuous discussion group, and information plus a reinforcement-to-change discussion group. The participants\\' attitudes toward elderly people were measured before, immediately after the intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. Changes in attitudes across groups and time were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t tests. Results: Information alone produced initial improvements in attitudes in all groups; however, only the group members who received additional reinforcement for change maintained positive attitude changes at one-month follow-up. Implications:This study supports the premise that negative attitudes toward older people are amendable; however, the new attitude may be lost without reinforcement for change. Purpose:\\u2002This study investigated how changes in Medicare and Medicaid policies affected skilled nursing facility (SNF) revenue streams and resident characteristics in Florida during the 1990s.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to analyze state-provided administrative data and Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data for all Florida SNFs.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We found that Florida SNFs responded differently to the growing gap in reimbursement between Medicaid and other payers, depending on their profit status. As the reimbursement gap grew, for-profit SNFs maximized their revenues by admitting fewer Medicaid paying residents, whereas nonprofit facilities increased their percentage of Medicaid admissions.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Changes in patterns of reimbursement altered the composition of Florida SNF residents in terms of age, physical status, length of stay, and place of discharge. Purpose: Health educators used health contracts with sedentary older adults for the purpose of increasing exercise or physical activity. Design and Methods: Two health educators helped 25 sedentary older adults complete health contracts, and then they conducted follow-up evaluations. The percentage of scheduled exercise sessions successfully completed by older adults was calculated. Participants were asked if each of five components of the health contract—motivation, goal setting, social support, memory techniques, and problem solving—was helpful in achieving their exercise goals. Results: Of the 25 participants, 20 achieved at least 75% of their exercise goals and 15 had a 100% success rate. Most of the older adults reported that several behavioral, social, and cognitive strategies were helpful to them. Implications: This technique may be applied by health educators or clinicians in a variety of settings and can be focused on one of several potential risk factors. Purpose:\\u2003The welfare reform bill of 1996 severely constrained noncitizens\\' eligibility for the Food Stamp Program (FSP). This study examined the effects of eligibility restrictions on older immigrants\\' FSP participation and food insecurity. We paid special attention to household composition and household eligibility as well as older immigrants\\' individual eligibility.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The sample consisted of 3,175 low-income older adults from the 1999 Current Population Survey. We used probit and tobit regressions. We compared three analytical models: two models using the differences-in-differences approach with two different measures of immigration status (individual and household status), and one using a summary variable of the percentage of FSP-eligible people in a household.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Both household immigration status and older adults\\' individual immigration status were significantly associated with the probability of FSP participation. Living in a household with a higher percentage of eligible members significantly increased older people\\'s FSP participation and benefit levels while significantly reducing their risk of food insecurity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Noncitizen eligibility restriction affects older immigrants\\' FSP participation and food insecurity by its relation to household composition. Experts should therefore consider household composition when developing social policies for older immigrants. The authors interviewed adults in five ethnic groups, used factor analysis to quantify attitudes toward planning for death, and used path analysis to test the relative influence of respondent characteristics, including ethnicity, and attitude factors (Advocacy to Discuss/Document Wishes, Trust in Family and Physician to Make Decisions, Reliance on Religious Guidance, Fears and Anxiety About Life\\'s End, and Fatalism About Death\\'s Timing) on support for physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Findings verified that attitude factors had a direct effect on PAS support but that, contrary to the hypothesis, ethnicity had a direct effect on support for PAS as well. Purpose:\\u2002This research investigates what factors affect the degree to which nursing home performance explains variance in residents\\' change in status of activities of daily living (ADL) after admission.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The database included all residents admitted in 2002 to a 10% random sample of nursing homes in the United States. Longitudinal analyses of outcomes at 3 months after admission test the ability of individual characteristics and nursing home identifiers to explain variance in ADL change for different groups of residents.\\u2003Results:\\u2002As we compared the best and worst providers (top 20% vs bottom 20%, then 10%, then 5%) and we restricted analyses to more homogeneous groups of residents, we found that more of the variance in ADL change was attributable to provider performance. Cognitive function and race also affected the degree to which home performance had an impact on outcomes.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results imply that some quality indicators may be most useful in distinguishing between nursing homes that provide the best or the worst care. Futhermore, the degree to which a quality indicator is driven by a nursing home\\'s performance may vary considerably, depending on the characteristics of the consumer. These findings raise questions about the usefulness of performance measures that focus on heterogeneous groups of consumers or entire provider populations. “How much of the variance in a quality indicator does provider performance explain?” is an issue we think has not received the attention it deserves in current discussions of performance-measurement strategies and pay-for-performance models. Purpose: The purpose of this research study was to examine the effect of a selected commercial-grade carpet on the static balance of healthy, older adults who had not fallen more than twice in the last 6 months. Design and Methods: We tested a total of 45 participants. Each participant stood on a computerized balance machine and was subjected to a carpeted versus a noncarpeted condition while exposed to various sensory limitations. We measured both postural sway and balance strategy. Results:The selected commercial-grade carpet did not affect postural sway. The participants were able to adapt to the sensory limitations regardless of whether they were standing on the carpet. Although balance strategy scores were significantly lower during the carpeted conditions, the clinical significance was questionable as the difference between the means was small for practical purposes. Implications:Healthy, older adults did not have difficulty maintaining static balance on the carpeted surface; however, the results could be different if participants who had a history of falling had been included. The results from this study are important and provide a basis of comparison for those individuals who have experienced more than two falls in the last 6 months or who have a history of falling. Purpose: While state policy and market factors are known to have contributed to the increased supply of residential care, little is known about efforts to accommodate demand from lower-income consumers. This study describes participation and expenditure trends for residential care services funded by Medicaid waivers and examines variation across programs. Design and Methods: We collected annually reported Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Form 372 data from state officials for each waiver that provides residential care services for the period 1995 to 2002. Descriptive statistics examined waiver program participation and expenditures while adjusting for population changes and inflation. Results: Between 1995 and 2002, national Medicaid waiver-funded residential care participants increased by almost threefold to 120,000 and expenditures more than quadrupled to $2.3 billion. However, Medicaid waiver program participation and spending varied considerably by state, by target population, and by level of care. Implications: This study highlights three important policy concerns: (a) Medicaid-supported residents remain underrepresented in residential care, (b) large interstate variation persists in Medicaid residential care service provision, and (c) state policy choices favor Medicaid spending on residential care for persons with mental retardation or developmental disabilities. Purpose: Social theories of aging are discussed in relation to their preparedness to address the aging-with-physical impairment phenomenon. Design and Methods:An overview of the social theories of aging is presented. Individual theories of aging are reviewed to examine (a) how they currently depict and/or include disability in their frameworks and (b) how they could be used to explore the experience of aging with physical impairment. Results:Most social theories of aging do not directly address aging with physical impairment or the cumulative experience of disability over the life course. Implications: Potential exists for social theories of aging to be applied to the experience of aging with physical impairment. To do so, physical impairment and disability must be clearly operationalized. The author suggests using social models of disability as frameworks in this process and provides examples of how this might be done with current social theories of aging. Purpose:\\u2002Throughout the 1990s, assisted living was the most rapidly growing form of senior housing. The purpose of this paper is to describe the existing supply of assisted living facilities (ALFs) and examine the extent to which they matched the philosophy of assisted living.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study involved a multistage sample design to produce nationally representative estimates for the ALF industry. Administrators of nearly 1,500 eligible ALFs were interviewed by telephone.\\u2003Results:\\u2002As of 1998, there were an estimated 11,459 ALFs nationwide, with 611,300 beds and 521,500 residents. Nearly 60% offered a combination of low services and low or minimal privacy, whereas only 11% offered relatively high services and high privacy. Seventy-three percent of the resident rooms or apartments were private. Aging-in-place was limited by discharge policies in most ALFs for residents who needed help with transfers, had moderate to severe cognitive impairment, had any behavioral symptoms, or needed nursing care. The industry is largely private pay and unaffordable for low- or moderate-income persons aged ≥75 unless they use assets as well as income to pay.\\u2003Implications: ALFs differed widely in ownership, size, policies, and the degree to which they manifested the philosophy of assisted living. This diversity represents a challenge for consumers in terms of selecting an appropriate facility and for policy makers in terms of deciding what role they want assisted living to play in long-term care.  Purpose: The Dementia Care Networks\\' Study examined the effectiveness of four community-based, not-for-profit dementia networks. The study involved assessing the relationship between the types of administrative and service-delivery exchanges that occurred among the networked agencies and the network members\\' perception of the effectiveness of these exchanges. Design and Methods: With the use of a case-study method, the evolution, structure, and processes of each network were documented. Social network analysis using a standardized questionnaire completed by member agencies identified patterns of administrative and clinical exchanges among networked agencies. Results: Differences were found between the four networks in terms of their perceptions of service-delivery effectiveness; perceptions of administrative effectiveness did not factor significantly. Exchanges between groups of agencies (cliques) within each of the four networks were found to be more critical than those between individual agencies within each network. Implications: Integration—measured by the types of exchanges within as opposed to across networks—differentiated the four networks studied. This research contributes to our understanding of the use of multiple measures to evaluate the inner workings of service delivery and their impact on elder health and elder health care. Purpose:\\u2002We call attention to the widespread belief that the United States is an “increasingly mobile society,” despite the fact that overall mobility has generally declined since about 1950, and interstate mobility has generally not increased during the same period. We review and extend past research documenting these mobility trends.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We describe population-level mobility for people of all ages as well as for several adult age groups, using published data from the U.S. Current Population Survey. We use simple regression methods to estimate the size and significance of mobility trends.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall mobility rates have declined for individuals of all ages and among all age groups. The largest average annual declines occur for 20- to 29-year-olds, although the rate of decline for those aged 65 and older is also large. Interstate mobility has declined slightly or remained constant, except among adults between 45 and 64 years old.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Although there may be good reasons to worry about the future of family care provided to elderly individuals, increased geographic mobility does not appear to be one of them. We speculate on reasons why the false belief persists. Purpose: We explored self-rated health by using a meaning-centered theoretical foundation. Self-appraisals, such as self-rated health, reflect a cultural process of identity formation, whereby identities are multiple, simultaneously individual and collective, and produced by specific historical formations. Anthropological research in Philadelphia determined (a) how African American elders appraise their health, and (b) how health evaluations reflect cultural and historical experiences within a community.Design and Methods: We interviewed and observed 35 adults aged 65 to 80, stratified by gender and self-rated health. We validated theme analysis of focused interview questions against the larger data set of field notes and transcripts. Results: Health appraisal reflected a complex process of adaptation and identity. Criteria for health included: independent functioning, physical condition, control and responsibility for health, and overall feeling. Evaluative rationales that shaped health appraisals were comparisons, restricted possibilities for self-evaluation, and ways of handling adversity. Evaluative rationales mitigated undesirable health identities (including low self-reported health) and provided mechanisms for claiming desired health identities despite adversity. Implications: Describing the criteria and evaluative rationales underlying self-appraisals of health extends current understandings of self-rated health and illustrates the sociohistorical context of individual assessments of well-being. Purpose:\\u2002The impact of major depression on quality of life (QOL) and aging experiences in older adults has been reported. Studies have demonstrated that the clinical diagnosis of major depression is the strongest predictor for QOL. We postulate that some findings are biased because of the use of inadequate instruments. Although subsyndromal depression is more prevalent than major depression, there are no reports on its impact on QOL or attitudes toward aging. In the present study we aim at assessing the association of major and subsyndromal depression on QOL and attitudes toward aging in a large international sample.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Our cross-sectional study assessed 4,316 respondents in 20 countries from five continents. The study used the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Assessment for Older Adults, known as the WHOQOL-OLD; the brief version of the WHOQOL instrument, known as the WHOQOL-BREF; and the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire. Statistical analyses involved hierarchical multiple regression, as well as comparison of means. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Even relatively minor levels of depression are associated with a significant decrease in all QOL domains and with a pattern of negative attitudes toward aging (overall WHOQOL-OLD R2 change =.421). QOL and attitudes toward aging scores are lower as depression intensity is increased, even in subsyndromal levels (overall WHOQOL-OLD mean scores of 95.7 vs 86.4, p <.001). This phenomenon happens not only for clinically depressed individuals but also for subsyndromic individuals.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Present findings suggest that classifying a respondent as nondepressed is not sufficient and is still not informative about his or her QOL and attitudes toward aging status. Purpose:\\u2002This study evaluated the social facilitation of elderly patients\\' food intake beyond the presence of mealtime companions by assessing various relationships. The study examined the relationships between patients\\' intake and (a) the number of interpersonal exchanges with mealtime fellows, (b) the nature of behaviors expressed by the patients themselves and their fellows, and (c) the degree of complementarity between these.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Interpersonal exchanges and intake were observed on repeated mealtime occasions (n = 1,477) nested within 32 geriatric patients (21 women, 11 men; age, M = 78.8 years). Participants\\' intake was estimated from plate leftovers. Interpersonal behaviors were examined for both participants and patients with whom they interacted in terms of agency and communion dimensions, following the interpersonal circumplex model of human interaction. With the use of multilevel regression analyses, the number, nature, and complementarity of behaviors that participants engaged in and were exposed to on a given meal were computed to test their impact on intake.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The total amount of interaction between patients was positively related to intake. The effect was significant for both participants\\' own behaviors and those to which they were exposed, and it varied with the nature of the interaction; effects were significant in terms of frequency and complementarity for communal behaviors, and complementarity only for agentic behaviors. Effects could only partly be explained by meal duration effects.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The results provide support for the effect of the number, nature, and complementarity of mealtime interpersonal behaviors on the food intake of elderly patients, and they may inspire new approaches to ensure adequate intake in this malnutrition-prone population. Purpose: This study adapted the Structural Family Systems Ratings (SFSR), an observational measure of family interactions, for dementia caregivers. This article presents the development of the SFSR–Dementia Caregiver adaptation (SFSR-DC) and examines relationships between specific family-interaction patterns and caregiver distress. Design and Methods: The families of 177 Cuban American and White non-Hispanic American caregivers of dementia patients were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Structural family theory and clinical experience were used to identify family interaction patterns believed to be related to caregiver emotional functioning. Factor analysis was used to refine subscales and develop a multiscale measure. Results: Six reliable subscales were related to caregiver distress and included in the SFSR-DC. There were two second-order factors. The SFSR-DC was provisionally cross-validated and showed invariance across the two ethnic groups. Implications: The SFSR-DC provides a method for examining specific and multiple interaction patterns in caregiver families and thus can advance knowledge regarding the role of the family in the stress processes of caregiving. These findings support the relevance of family interactions in caregiver distress and suggest that a treatment approach aimed at supporting family closeness and conflict resolution and reducing negativity might enhance caregiver well-being. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this research is twofold. The first purpose is to utilize a new methodology (Bayesian networks) for aggregating various quality indicators to measure the overall quality of care in nursing homes. The second is to provide new insight into the relationships that exist among various measures of quality and how such measures affect the overall quality of nursing home care as measured by the Observable Indicators of Nursing Home Care Quality Instrument. In contrast to many methods used for the same purpose, our method yields both qualitative and quantitative insight into nursing home care quality.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We construct several Bayesian networks to study the influences among factors associated with the quality of nursing home care; we compare and measure their accuracy against other predictive models.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We find the best Bayesian network to perform better than other commonly used methods. We also identify key factors, including number of certified nurse assistant hours, prevalence of bedfast residents, and prevalence of daily physical restraints, that significantly affect the quality of nursing home care. Furthermore, the results of our analysis identify their probabilistic relationships.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings of this research indicate that nursing home care quality is most accurately represented through a mix of structural, process, and outcome measures of quality. We also observe that the factors affecting the quality of nursing home care collectively determine the overall quality. Hence, focusing on only key factors without addressing other related factors may not substantially improve the quality of nursing home care. Purpose: This study considered the extent of workers\\' unfamiliarity with retirement benefits, a problem that could compromise informed retirement planning. Design and Methods: Among workers in the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, we examined the frequency of \"don\\'t know\" responses to question series about employer pensions, health insurance, and Social Security. Results: Eligible workers readily offered responses about the shared, public details of pension plans, but knowledge about personal pension wealth was lacking for one third of persons in defined benefit plans and for one fifth of those in defined contribution plans. Among household financial respondents, 14% did not know about health insurance continuation after retirement, and 52% could not offer an expected Social Security amount. Such nonresponse was patterned by proximity to retirement and by social and occupational factors. Implications: More than a problem of missing data, these findings argue for a theoretical reconsideration of the role of financial knowledge in retirement behavior. Ignorance of benefits is probably less a problem of disclosure than of workers\\' inattention to available information. Purpose: We identified the types of home- and community-based services (HCBS) that high-risk older adults in Medicare managed care used, and we examined participant characteristics associated with service use in six areas: overall service use, four specific categories of HCBS, and referrals to insured medical services. Design and Methods: We used service data from the Care Advocate Demonstration Program, a telephone-based care-management intervention that linked chronically ill older adults to HCBS. Two hundred and twenty-four high-risk older adults who were enrolled in a southern California-based Medicare managed care plan received an assessment, service referrals, and 12 months of telephone follow-up by master\\'s level social service professionals. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds of using the HCBS categories and medical services. Results: Results indicated that characteristics associated with service use varied extensively, depending on the service. Age, gender, social support, living situation, education, specific functional impairments, heart conditions, and sensory impairments at baseline significantly predicted utilization in the six different service models. Implications: Policy implications include the importance of individualized care-management assessments that direct targeted referrals to appropriate services. Findings support the need for individualized care-management assessment and service planning, suggesting that a “one size fits all” approach to HCBS will not meet the varied needs of diverse consumers. Purpose: Although disability is widely acknowledged as a risk factor for late-life depression, few studies have studied the potential of psychosocial factors to alter the association between disability and depression. The present study assessed the impacts of mastery and social resources (social network, social support, and satisfaction with support) on depression and, in particular, whether they modify the link between disability and depression. Design and Methods: The direct and moderating effects of mastery and social resources were empirically tested using a sample of 406 community-dwelling older adults who were cognitively intact (mean age = 72.3). Results:Higher level of mastery and greater satisfaction with support had significant direct effects on depression and also buffered the adverse impact of disability on depression. Implications: The findings support the importance of psychosocial factors in modifying the association between disability and depression and suggest that efforts to enhance positive psychosocial attributes should be emphasized in interventions for older adults. Purpose: We report the results of a survey of state initiatives that measure resident satisfaction in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and we describe several model programs for legislators and public administrators contemplating the initiation of their own state programs.\\u2003Design andMethods:\\u2002Data on state initiatives and programs were collected during March and April 2000 through a mailed questionnaire and follow-up telephone interviews and were current as of September 2002.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 50 states surveyed, 50 responses were received (response rate = 100%); 12 states (24%) reported the use of consumer satisfaction measures, and 7 (Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin) reported using resident satisfaction data within their consumer information systems for nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Additionally, 2 states (Iowa and Wisconsin) use resident satisfaction data for facility licensing and recertification. The design of the instruments and collection methods vary in these states, as do the reported response rates, per-resident cost, and the purpose for satisfaction data collection.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002State satisfaction efforts are in an early stage of development. Well-produced, easily understandable reports on nursing home and assisted living quality could provide information and guidance for patients and families contemplating the utilization of long-term care services. Dissemination of quality information may also facilitate sustained quality and efficiency improvements in long-term care facilities and thus enhance the quality of care for and quality of life of long-term care residents. This article describes the prevalence, assessment, and treatment of, as well as characteristics associated with, mobility limitation in 343 residents with dementia in 45 assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Overall, 89% of residents had some degree of mobility limitation. Mobility limitation was associated with fewer behavioral symptoms, low fluid intake, professional assessment, and professional and informal treatment. Purpose:\\u2002Despite substantial regulatory oversight, quality of care in nursing homes remains problematic. This article assesses strategies for improving quality of care in these facilities.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This article reviews the research literature on eight strategies: strengthening the regulatory process, improving information systems for quality monitoring, strengthening the caregiving workforce, providing consumers with more information, strengthening consumer advocacy, increasing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, developing and implementing practice guidelines, and changing the culture of nursing facilities.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Although individual approaches vary, several themes emerge. First, several strategies require substantially more resources and will increase costs. Second, the research literature does not provide much guidance as to the effectiveness of these options. Third, several strategies assume a degree of data sophistication on the part of nursing homes that may not exist. Fourth, regulation is likely to continue to be the main strategy of quality assurance. Finally, the political saliency of nursing home quality issues is uneven.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Quality of care in nursing homes is a major issue for which there is no simple solution. Purpose: There is no clear consensus about how sex influences prevalent disability and through what mechanisms. We investigated whether sex had a direct inde-pendent effect on disability or whether sex had an interactive effect on the relationship between chronic diseases/conditions and disability, and whether these effects differed in middle-aged versus older adults. Design and Methods:We used baseline data from two nationally representative health interview surveys, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), and disability and covariate measures that were nearly identical in both surveys. Logistic regression models tested the contributions of diseases, impairments, and demographic and social characteristics on difficulties with prevalent activities of daily living (ADLs), mobility, and strength. Results:Models demonstrated no direct sex effect for ADL disability in either age group after adjusting for key covariates. However, sex did exert an indirect effect on ADL disability in older adults via musculoskeletal conditions and depressive symptoms. In contrast, female sex remained strongly associated with mobility and strength disability in both age groups, net of covariates. Major interactions were also significant, including a female sex/body mass index (BMI) interaction for mobility difficulty and several sex–disease interactions for strength disability in the middle-aged group. Implications: The effect of sex on ADL difficulty is largely explained by social and health-related covariates in middle-aged and older adults. In contrast, the independent association of female sex with decreased strength and mobility in both groups cannot be explained by our models\\' social or health-related variables. In addition, the positive association of BMI with mobility difficulty is significantly worse for women than for men. Purpose: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is widely used in clinical and research settings to screen older adults for depressive symptoms. Although several exploratory factor analytic structures have been proposed for the scale, no independent confirmation has been made available that would enable investigators to confidently identify scores for the subdimensions of depression represented in the scale. Design and Methods: This article describes a confirmatory factor analysis of the 30-item GDS, with the factor structure based on an exploratory principal components analysis that was published earlier. The original study sample consisted of 327 community-dwelling adults aged 65–94 years. The confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data from an independent sample of 294 adults aged 60–98 years who resided in retirement facilities. Results: The proposed final measurement model uses 26 of the items from the GDS in five factors and obtains a goodness-of-fit index of.90. The resulting distinct subdimensions are Dysphoric Mood, Withdrawal–Apathy–Vigor, Hopelessness, Cognitive, and Anxiety. Implications: Although results should be considered preliminary, the use of these five subdimensions as subscales for scoring purposes may improve the precision and utility of the GDS as an assessment tool for older adults in health, mental health, and research contexts. Purpose:\\u2002We investigated the role of race in predicting the likelihood of using hospice and dying in a hosptial among dual-eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) nursing home residents.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This follow-back cohort study examined factors associated with hospice use and in-hospital death among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White dual-eligible nursing home residents (N = 30,765) who died in Florida during one of three years: 2000, 2001, or 2002. We used logistic regression models to identify independent predictors of hospice use and in-hospital death.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After we controlled for other factors, Black residents were significantly less likely to use hospice and more likely to die in a hospital. Principal cause of death moderated the relationship between race and hospice use: Black residents were significantly less likely to use hospice than White residents among residents without cancer as principal cause of death, but there was no difference among residents with cancer as cause of death. Further analyses for each racial group revealed that the impact of cause of death in predicting hospice use was greater among Black residents than White residents.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Hospice care offers many benefits, including reduced risk of in-hospital death, but Black nursing home residents are less likely to use hospice and may have different perceptions of need for hospice care compared with White residents. Future research and outreach efforts should focus on developing culturally sensitive, disease-focused end-of-life education and communication interventions that target residents, families, nursing home providers, and physicians. Purpose: This article focuses on why it is important for long-term care ombudsmen to collect resident demographics. Design and Methods: The authors analyzed a cross-sectional, 6-state database to show the importance of ombudsman programs\\' collecting demographic information about the residents of long-term care facilities whom they serve. To demonstrate the importance of collecting demographic data about residents, the authors examined the relationships between race, gender, and types of complaints lodged, verified, and fully resolved. Results: A higher percentage of complaints lodged on behalf of racial minorities was verified, yet a lower percentage was fully resolved. Implications: Ombudsman databases are a potential resource for identifying residents\\' characteristics that increase their vulnerability in long-term care settings. Purpose:In this study the levels of staff turnover reported in the nursing home literature (1990–2003) are reviewed, as well as the definitions of turnover used in these prior studies. With the use of primary data collected from 354 facilities, the study addresses the various degrees of bias that result, depending on how staff turnover is defined in nursing homes.Design and Methods:Data came from a survey mailed to administrators of 526 nursing homes during March 2003. Facilities were located in four states: Missouri, Texas, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Three hundred and fifty-four responses were received, giving a response rate of 67%.Results:The 1-year turnover rates identified in these facilities were 119%, 89%, 87%, 57%, and 48%, for nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, administrators, and directors of nursing, respectively. However, findings show that the definition of turnover used could influence the relative difference between these reported rates by as much as 47%. Implications:As a result of measurement error, turnover rates may be misrepresented in prior studies. On the basis of the results of this investigation, several recommendations are made for future data-collection initiatives that will eliminate some of this measurement error. Purpose: The present study attempts to determine whether utilizing community-based long-term-care services early in the dementia caregiving career delays time to nursing home placement (adjusting for severity of dementia). Design and Methods: With a reliance on data from 4,761 dementia caregivers recruited from eight catchment areas in the United States and followed over a 3-year period, a Cox proportional hazards model was conducted that considered key components of the stress process (e.g., context of care, primary objective and subjective stressors, and resources), duration, and community-based long-term-care use. Results: An analysis of interaction terms in the Cox regression model found that those individuals who utilized in-home help services earlier in their dementia caregiving careers were more likely to delay institutionalization. Implications: The findings suggest the practical importance and cost-effectiveness implications of early community-based service use, and they emphasize the role of timing when one is conceptualizing the proliferation of stress in the dementia caregiving career. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to, among frail dually eligible older adults, determine risk factors for the likelihood of using Medicare home health and Medicaid home health services and to, among service users, determine correlates of Medicare home health, Medicaid home health, and Medicaid waiver service expenditures. Design and Methods: Dually eligible individuals enrolled in Connecticut\\'s Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS) waiver program for the aged (N = 5,232) were identified from a statewide database containing person-level linked data from Medicare claims, Medicaid claims, and uniform clinical assessment forms. Expenditures, based on claims data, were observed from the month following clinical assessment over the period August 1995 to December 1997. Results: In multivariate models controlling for medical conditions and sociodemographic variables, similar functional disability measures were strongly associated with the probability of the use of, and expenditures for, Medicare home health and Medicaid home health services; severe cognitive impairment was strongly associated with greater Medicaid waiver service expenditures. Implications: Given the similarity of factors associated with Medicare and Medicaid home health service use and expenditures, greater integration of Medicare and Medicaid financing, reimbursement, and delivery strategies for home health services may be feasible and warranted for dually eligible older adults enrolled in state Medicaid HCBS waiver programs. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to describe the processes of care, organizational attributes, cost of care, staffing level, and staff mix in a sample of Missouri homes with good, average, and poor resident outcomes.Design and Methods:A three-group exploratory study design was used, with 92 nursing homes randomly selected from all nursing homes in Missouri and classified into resident outcome groups. Resident outcomes were measured by use of quality indicators derived from nursing home Minimum Data Set resident assessment data. Cost and staffing information were derived from Medicaid cost reports. Participant observation methods were used to describe the care delivery processes.Results:In facilities with good resident outcomes, there are basics of care and processes surrounding each that staff consistently do: helping residents with ambulation, nutrition and hydration, and toileting and bowel regularity; preventing skin breakdown; and managing pain. The analysis revealed necessary organizational attributes that must be in place in order for those basics of care to be accomplished: consistent nursing and administrative leadership, the use of team and group processes, and an active quality improvement program. The only facility characteristic across the outcome groups that was significantly different was the number of licensed beds, with smaller facilities having better outcomes. No significant differences in costs, staffing, or staff mix were detected across the groups. A trend in higher total costs of $13.58 per resident per day was detected in the poor-outcome group compared with the good-outcome group.Implications:For nursing homes to achieve good resident outcomes, they must have leadership that is willing to embrace quality improvement and group process and see that the basics of care delivery are done for residents. Good quality care may not cost more than poor quality care; there is some evidence that good quality care may cost less. Small facilities of 60 beds were more likely to have good resident outcomes. Strategies have to be considered so larger facilities can be organized into smaller clusters of units that could function as small nursing homes within the larger whole. Purpose:\\u2002Caregivers of stroke patients may adapt to changes in patient functioning over time. If adaptation occurs, then caregiver burden and health may be influenced more by worsening in patient functioning than by static levels of functioning. This study examines the relationship between patients\\' baseline and changes in functioning and caregivers\\' subjective and objective burden as well as their health.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Only stroke patients who had caregivers were included in this analysis (N = 356). Stroke patients (n = 281) or their proxies (n = 75) were interviewed within 4 months of hospital discharge and patients\\' medical records were abstracted. The primary caregiver also was interviewed at approximately the same time as the patient or proxy (N = 356). In all but one of the 75 proxy cases, the proxy was the patient\\'s caregiver. Binomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Declining patient neurological functioning predicted greater objective burden and subjective burden relating to consequences for caregivers\\' personal lives, but it did not predict caregiver health.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The impact a patient\\'s stroke has on a caregiver\\'s personal life and the number of hours spent caring for the patient appear to be a function of the changes of the patient\\'s status over time rather than a function of a “snapshot” of their functioning at baseline. If these results are confirmed, interventions to protect caregivers may be indicated for stroke patients who continue to decline after hospital discharge. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the direction and magnitude of the effects among the components of resident satisfaction in residential aged care and to examine if the relationships among satisfaction components vary according to facility type (i.e., nursing home and hostel). Briefly, a hostel is a low-care facility in which residents are more independent and receive personal but not nursing care. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted to collect the required information, and a stratified random sampling approach was used to select facilities. Structural equation modeling was used to examine relationships among satisfaction components in a sample of 394 nursing home and 752 hostel residents. Results: The results indicate that satisfaction with staff care has a moderate and positive effect on all other aspects of resident satisfaction. The relationships among satisfaction components are different for nursing home and hostel residents. Implications: The findings lead to an improved understanding of the interrelationship among resident satisfaction components, which has important implications for improving quality outcomes (e.g., resident satisfaction) through appropriate intervention (e.g., enhancing staff care). Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to examine the joint effects of bereavement and caregiver intervention on caregiver depressive symptoms.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Alzheimer\\'s caregivers from a randomized trial of an enhanced caregiver support intervention versus usual care who had experienced the death of their spouse (n = 254) were repeatedly assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale prior to and following bereavement. Random effects regression growth curve analyses examined the effects of treatment group and bereavement while controlling for other variables. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The death of the care recipient led to reductions in depressive symptoms for both caregiving groups. Enhanced support intervention led to lower depressive symptoms compared with controls both before and after bereavement. Post-bereavement group differences were stronger for caregivers of spouses who did not previously experience a nursing home placement. These caregivers maintained these differences for more than 1 year after bereavement. Caregivers who received the enhanced support intervention were more likely to show long-term patterns of fewer depressive symptoms before and after bereavement, suggesting resilience, whereas control caregivers were more likely to show chronic depressive symptoms before and after the death of their spouse.\\u2003Implications:Caregiver intervention has the potential to alter the long-term course of the caregiving career. Such clinical strategies may also protect caregivers against chronic depressive symptoms that would otherwise persist long after caregiving ends. Purpose:When compositional differences between age groups are controlled, the bivariate, curvilinear pattern of age differences in voluntary association memberships is replaced by one in which peak membership levels occur in late middle age and remain relatively stable thereafter. We sought to determine if this adjusted pattern persists when widespread memberships in two types of associations are removed: (1) church-related organizations, in which membership increases with age but may be confounded with church membership per se; and (2) labor unions, in which membership is also widespread but may not be \"voluntary.\"Design and Methods:Total memberships in 14 types of associations were examined using aggregated data from 12 national surveys conducted between 1974 and 1994.Results:The familiar curvilinear relationship at the bivariate level appears, but in the multivariate analysis, membership levels rise from ages 18–24 through 55–59 and persist close to that level through ages 85 and older.Implications:The results reaffirm that age differences in voluntary association affiliations are due to age-based compositional differences; they also show, however, that the pattern observed with controls is neither driven by membership in church-related \"associations\" nor altered when membership in labor unions is excluded. Purpose: This study examines population-based trends in home care service utilization, alone and in conjunction with hospitalizations, during a period of health reform in Canada. It focuses on the extent to which observed trends suggest enhanced community-based care relative to three competing hypotheses: cost-cutting, medicalization, and profitization. Design and Methods: Analyses drew on administrative health data from the province of British Columbia for the period from 1990 through 2000. Annual trends in age- and gender-adjusted utilization rates are examined by use of joinpoint regression; multivariate analyses draw on generalized linear modeling. Results:Home support claims decreased significantly during the study period. There was less evidence of decline with regard to home nursing care claims and the extent of both home support and home nursing care. Intensity of care increased for home support services but decreased somewhat for home nursing care. Multivariate analyses revealed a decline in joint use of home support and hospital care and little change in joint use of home nursing and hospital care. Similarities as well as differences in trends are evident across age groups. Implications: The findings suggest a reduction and reallocation of health services in general rather than a shift of focus toward community-based care. In this way, they appear more consistent with a cost-reduction hypothesis than with expectations of enhanced community-based care that are generated by recent health reform initiatives. Purpose: Healthful eating is important for optimal diabetes self-care. However, the level of food sufficiency may influence the degree of adherence to dietary self-care behaviors through the affordability of nutritionally appropriate food. This study examines whether homebound older adults with diabetes were at greater risk for heightened food insufficiency over 1 year, despite regular receipt of home-delivered meals. Design and Methods: This was a longitudinal study of a randomly recruited sample of 268 homebound older adults in the Nutrition and Function Study (NAFS) who regularly received home-delivered meals and completed baseline and 1-year in-home assessments. Based on an economic context model, self-reported data were collected on fundamental and proximate factors, food-sufficiency status, and intervening events. Determinants of heightened food insufficiency were examined with multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Not only did food-sufficiency status diminish over time in this sample, but it became or remained worse for older adults with diabetes. In addition to diabetes status, heightened food insufficiency was associated with perceived inadequacy of economic resources. Implications:&!ensp;Health care providers and nutrition programs should attempt to identify high-risk older adults – those who have diabetes and are at risk of food insufficiency – and develop community linkages and strategies that integrate nutrition with diabetes care plans, thus supporting a multidisciplinary, chronic care model to improve diabetes management and outcomes. Purpose: The aims of this study were to examine differences between older men and women: (a) in the ability of self-rated health to predict mortality, (b) in the effect of different follow-up periods on the self-rated health mortality relationship, and (c) in the relative importance of self-rated health and self-rated change in health in predicting mortality. Design and Methods: By using data from the Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing, the author assessed relationships between self-rated health and self-rated change in health and 4- and 12-year mortality in separate unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models in men and women. Results: The differences between men and women in the hazard ratios for poor self-rated health were not significant, although there were differences in the explanatory factors. The relationship between self-rated health and short-term and long-term mortality was explained by age and health among men. The relationship between self-rated health and short-term mortality was explained by age, physical and mental health, and physical activity among women. The relationship between self-rated health and long-term mortality was explained by age, physical health, and physical activity among women. The relationship between self-rated change in health and short-term mortality was explained by age among men and women. The relationship between self-rated change in health and long-term mortality was explained by age and physical health among men and women. Social engagement was an independent predictor of short- and long-term mortality among men and women in this study. Implications: The finding that low self-rated health was not an independent predictor of mortality among men or women, contrary to many, but not all, previous studies, may be related to differences in study design and/or across cultures. Further research investigating relationships between self-rated health and mortality and potential explanatory variables should analyze men and women separately and should consider the length of follow-up period. The benefits of individual physical and social activities in reducing mortality merit further investigation. Purpose: We compare the economic consequences of widowhood for preretirement age and early-retirement age Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women. Methods: We use the 1992 and 2000 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to assess the effects of widowhood on the household incomes and assets of non-Hispanic White, Black, and Hispanic women who were 51 years of age or older at baseline (N = 4,544). Results: For women of all racial and ethnic groups, marital disruption, including widowhood, results in a substantial decline in household income and assets. Net of demographic controls, the relative loss is far greater for Black and Hispanic widows than for non-Hispanic White widows. Implications: The data reveal a substantial widowhood penalty for total household income and net worth for women in each racial and ethnic group. However, the findings suggest that minority widows are at a particularly high risk of poverty in late life, given that they have lower incomes and fewer assets to begin with. Implications of the results for the financial security of women approaching retirement are discussed. Purpose: This article reviews and critiques several issues of importance to those whose goal is to make intervention research with Latino caregivers more “user-friendly.” Issues range from current demographic trends showing the ever-increasing number of Latino caregivers to discussion of cultural values that influence their help-seeking behavior.\\u2003Design and Methods: This article presents a review of current published information on this topic. The gerontological literature was searched for the past decade for relevant material; in addition, the authors\\' own experience in this area is described.\\u2003Results: Although limited information was found that derived from actual empirical studies, a number of articles describe potential barriers to research involvement and provide suggestions for making participation more attractive and culturally appropriate for Latinos.\\u2003Implications: Clinical researchers need to increase their sensitivity to such issues as cultural values and language preference and develop effective collaborations with the Latino community so that intervention research programs can be designed and implemented successfully with Latinos caring for cognitively impaired elderly family members at home. Purpose:\\u2002This research applies a stress and support conceptual model to investigate the effects of background characteristics, personal and job-related stressors, and workplace support on direct care workers\\' (DCW) job satisfaction.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Researchers collected survey data from 644 DCWs in 49 long-term care (LTC) organizations. The DCWs included nurse assistants in nursing homes, resident assistants in assisted living facilities, and home care aides in home health agencies. We examined the influence of components of the LTC stress and support model on DCW job satisfaction. Initially, we ran a multiple regression analysis by entering individual-level DCW predictors with job satisfaction as the outcome. Subsequently, we used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the influence of organizational factors on DCW job satisfaction after controlling for significant individual-level DCW variables.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Components of the model explained 51% of the variance in DCW job satisfaction. Background characteristics of DCWs were less important than personal stressors (e.g., depression), job-related stressors (e.g., continuing education), and social support (e.g., interactions with others) in predicting job satisfaction. Results from hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that nursing homes compared to the two other types of LTC organizations had lower average DCW job satisfaction rates, as did organizations offering lower minimum hourly rates and those reporting turnover problems.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Study findings underscore the importance of targeting both DCW-level and organizational-level factors to increase DCW job satisfaction. Purpose:\\u2002To evaluate how recruitment strategies and program characteristics interact with participant characteristics to influence recruitment and retention in an exercise intervention study targeted to African American and White older adults with multiple chronic illnesses.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Characteristics of 273 referrals and 103 enrollees were analyzed in conjunction with programmatic decisions about recruitment design and eligibility criteria.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Eligible participants who did not enroll were younger and more likely to be under 60 and to self-report having diabetes. After 1 year, 70% of the enrolled participants remained in the program. Program attrition was not associated with randomization, race, or chronic illness but was associated with functional status, having a high school degree, and program site.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Program design decisions can significantly influence the participation of underrepresented populations in exercise health promotion programs for older adults. In particular, group-specific efforts targeted to recruiting and retaining African Americans can be successful. Purpose:Many primary care physicians find caring for elderly patients difficult. The goal of this study was to develop a detailed understanding of why physicians find primary care with elderly patients difficult. Design and Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 primary care physicians. Using an iterative approach based on grounded theory techniques, a multidisciplinary team analyzed the content of the interviews and developed a conceptual model of the difficulty. Results:Three major domains of difficulty emerged: (i) medical complexity and chronicity, (ii) personal and interpersonal challenges, and (iii) administrative burden. The greatest challenge occurred when difficulty in more than one area was present. Contextual conditions, such as the practice environment and the physician\\'s training and personal values, shaped the experience of providing care and how difficult it seemed. Implications:Much of the difficulty participants experienced could be facilitated by changes in the health care delivery system and in medical education. The voices of these physicians and the model resulting from our analysis can inform such change. Purpose: This article reports on the development and field testing of the Savvy Caregiver Program, the transformation of a successful, academic-based caregiver psychoeducational program into a self-contained program that can be adopted in other locations.Design and Methods: Program development began with a prototype of a 12-hr course with the aims of introducing family caregivers to the caregiving role, providing them with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to carry out that role, and alerting them to self-care issues. Results from initial field trials dictated a substantial revision of the workshop materials. The next version was field tested in multiple sites in southern rural Minnesota, Colorado, and Alaska. In this expanded testing, participants evaluated the program, and cross-group comparisons were conducted by use of well-established caregiver well-being scales.Results: Virtually all respondents reported increased skill, knowledge, and confidence, and all would recommend the program to others. A preintervention versus postintervention analysis indicates that caregivers\\' reaction to the overall behavior of the persons for whom they provide care (i.e., “total reaction”), their self-reported burden, and their beliefs about caregiving (emotional enmeshment) changed significantly in directions indicating better caregiver well-being. Implications:Results suggest that it is feasible to translate a research-based caregiver intervention into a packaged program that can be adopted in other settings without the direct involvement of the program initiators. Purpose:\\u2002Public attention directed toward the civic engagement of retired Americans has increased considerably. The purpose of this research was to define civic engagement as a retirement role and differentiate individuals who met this role definition from other retirees.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Retirees who met our definition of civic engagement were identified from a sample of 683 retired older adults living in a rural Midwestern state. Using a multinomial logistic regression analysis, we contrasted this group of engaged retirees to three other groups of retirees: (a) those who were neither working nor volunteering, (b) those who had returned to work in part-time or seasonal occupations, and (c) those who volunteered for fewer than 5 hours each week.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The analyses indicated that individuals assigned to the group of engaged retirees were similar across 24 variables. This group of engaged retirees differed from the other groups by gender, education level, and health status; retirement motives and planning efforts; primary retirement activities; and attitudes about volunteering and returning to work.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This research supported the contention that civic engagement could be defined as a formal retirement role, as engaged retirees differ significantly from those who volunteer less, work in noncivic roles, or do neither. Further, we resolved that associating the act of volunteering, in itself, with civic engagement may no longer be appropriate for retired older adults. The definition of civic engagement as a retirement role should also include those individuals who return to work in organizations that pursue specific civic activities. This article, based on a Lawton Award Lecture, addresses the subject of the need to enhance the evidence base in our field in order to influence processes of policy development. Four issues are identified as critical to this: theory-driven targets of public health significance, use of appropriate and sophisticated approaches to research design and statistical modeling, development of instruments and measures, and conclusions that make a difference. Incentives are discussed with particular attention to regulatory approaches. A broad view of research is taken, with examples from studies of Alzheimer\\'s disease and depression in late life. I conclude that new approaches to methodology will enhance our capacity to translate exciting new findings from the basic sciences into the development of therapeutics and that this will, in turn, enhance our capacity to inform the development of public policy. Purpose: We developed and tested theoretically derived procedures to observe physical environments experienced by nursing home residents at three nested levels: their rooms, the nursing unit, and the overall facility. Illustrating with selected descriptive results, in this article we discuss the development of the approach. Design and Methods: On the basis of published literature, existing instruments, and expert opinion about environmental elements that might affect quality of life, we developed separate observational checklists for the room and bath environment, unit environment, and facility environment. We trained 40 interviewers without specialized design experience to high interrater reliability with the room-level assessment. We used the three checklists to assess 1,988 resident room and bath environments, 131 nursing units, and 40 facilities in five states. From the data elements, we developed quantitative indices to describe the facilities according to environmentally relevant constructs such as function-enhancing features, life-enriching features, resident environmental controls, and personalization. Results: We reliably gathered data on a large number of environmental items at three environmental levels. Environments varied within and across facilities, and we noted many environmental deficits potentially relevant to resident quality of life. Implications: This research permits resident-specific data collection on physical environments and resident-level research using hierarchical analysis to examine the effects of specific environmental constellations. We describe practice and research implications for this approach. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined the contribution of facility-level and area market-level attributes to variations in hospitalization rates among nursing home residents.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Three years (1991–1994) of state quarterly Medicaid case-mix reimbursement data from 527 nursing homes (NH) in Massachusetts were linked with Medicare Provider Analysis and Review hospital claims and nursing facility attribute data to produce a longitudinal, analytical file containing 72,319 person-quarter observations. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the influence of facility-level and market-level factors on hospital use, after controlling for individual-level resident attributes, including: NH diagnoses, resident-level quality of care indicators, and diagnostic cost grouping classification from previous hospital stays.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Multivariate findings suggest that resident heterogeneity alone does not account for the wide variations in hospitalization rates across nursing homes. Instead, facility characteristics such as profit status, nurse staffing patterns, NH size, chain affiliation, and percentage of Medicaid and Medicare reimbursed days significantly influence NH residents\\' risk of hospitalization. Broader area market factors also appear to contribute to variations in hospitalization rates.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Variations in hospitalization rates may reflect underutilization, as well as overutilization. Continued efforts toward identifying medically necessary hospitalizations are needed. Purpose: This study assesses whether the stagnation of old-age (80+) mortality decline observed in The Netherlands in the 1980s continued in the 1990s and determines which factors contributed to this stagnation. Emphasis is on the role of smoking. Design\\u2009and\\u2009Methods: Poisson regression analysis with linear splines was applied to total and cause-specific mortality data by age, year of death (1950–1999), and sex. An age–period–cohort analysis was carried out to determine whether the trends followed period or cohort patterns. ICD revisions were bridged by use of a concordance table. Results: A sudden reversal in old-age mortality decline occurred around 1980, leading to a stagnation of the decline and even increases in mortality thereafter. Smoking-related cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diseases specifically related to old age contributed to this stagnation. Trends in smoking-related cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a cohort pattern—especially for men. When these smoking-related diseases were excluded, the trends in old-age mortality in The Netherlands showed an increasing stagnation for both sexes. Implications: Smoking behavior can only partly explain the stagnation of mortality. Other factors such as increased frailty and changes in medical and social services for elderly people probably played a more decisive role in the recent stagnation. Purpose: This article reviews the state of science on the economics of end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries and outlines the research needed to fill gaps in that literature. Design and Methods: Searches of the medical, health services, and economics literature were conducted. Key topics examined were studies of spending on end-of-life care and financial, organizational, and nonfinancial barriers to high-quality end-of-life care. Results:Studies have documented poor quality of care, dissatisfaction with care, and limitations in the coverage of end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries. However, critical gaps in our knowledge about how to design a better end-of-life care system for Medicare beneficiaries remain. Implications: Further research on how treatment decisions at the end of life are made and prospective studies of costs, satisfaction, and outcomes are needed. Purpose: To identify the most common beliefs concerning the negative consequences of falling and determine whether these motivate avoidance of activity. Design and Methods: A questionnaire assessing feared consequences of falling was completed by 224 community-living people aged older than 75. Beliefs about the consequences of falling were related to demographic characteristics, falling history, and avoidance of activity. The questionnaires were completed again by 166 participants 6 months later. Results: Commonly feared consequences of falling were loss of functional independence and damage to identity. These fears were correlated with avoidance of activity (after adjusting for age, sex, and recent falling history) and predicted avoidance in activity 6 months later (after adjusting for baseline levels of avoidance). Implications:Concerns about damage to social identity, as well as functional incapacity, are common and may motivate avoidance of activity. Purpose: To describe a pilot initiative sponsored by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to improve the health and community tenure of frail older veterans living in rural counties 50–100 miles from two host VHA medical centers. Design and Methods: Veterans aged 75 and older who scored at risk of repeated hospital admission on the PRA-Plus telephone questionnaire were targeted and visited by evaluators who administered a comprehensive health questionnaire prior to being assessed at home by the Coordination and Advocacy for Rural Elders (CARE) program clinical teams. Guided by current state-of-the-art practices, the nurse–social worker teams performed in-home standardized assessments using the MDS-HC, developed patient-specific care plans, and mobilized family, community, and VHA resources to implement plans. Results:On average, eight problems were identified for each patient, most commonly falls risk, social needs, pain, and needs related to IADL disability. As a result of initial assessment, two thirds of CARE participants received referral/linkage to formal services, more than half to medical providers. Implications: Through CARE, the VHA is learning more about the unmet needs of older rural veterans. Further development and evaluation should guide the VHA toward providing efficient, effective community-based services to all frail older veterans. Purpose: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sponsored a nationwide study to evaluate the federal paid feeding assistant (PFA) regulation that allows nursing homes to hire single-task workers to provide feeding assistance to nursing home residents. Organizers designed the PFA regulation to increase the number of staff available to provide assistance with eating and improve nutritional care process quality. Design and Methods:Trained research staff used standardized protocols to conduct direct observations during meals and face-to-face staff interviews in a convenience sample of seven facilities with PFA programs to evaluate care process quality. Results: Most (84%) of the trained PFAs in the seven site visit facilities were non-nursing staff within the facility; the quality of feeding assistance care provided by these workers was comparable to that provided by indigenous nurse aides. There were no reported changes in existing staffing levels (nurse aide or licensed nurses) following PFA program implementation, and the majority (> 90%) of indigenous staff at all levels reported positive benefits of the PFA program for both staff and residents. Implications: Findings from this preliminary study indicate that the PFA regulation may serve to increase the utilization of existing non-nursing staff to improve feeding assistance care during meals without having a negative impact on existing nurse aide and licensed nurse staffing levels. Purpose:\\u2002Given stereotypes of older adults, there is the perception that older adults will not use health information technologies. One concern is that practitioners might shy away from providing older patients with health information, and in particular, computerized information. The study\\'s primary objective was to evaluate whether a health information intervention had a differential effect for people of different ages. Design and Methods:\\u2002Quasi-experimental survey data from an assessment of a communitywide informational intervention were used. People were asked about their use of medical reference books, telephone advice nurses, or computers for health information in the past few months. In total, 5,909 surveys were completed.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The data show that older adults were no less likely (and were sometimes more likely) to use health information as a result of the intervention than younger adults. For telephone advice nurses and computers, the effect of the intervention was not significantly different for the different age groups. Yet, compared with persons 18–29 years of age, those over the age of 65 had a 17-percentage point increase in using a self-care book.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We find convincing evidence to counter the stereotype that older adults are resistant to trying new health information technologies. Purpose of Study: To maximize respondent participation in a study of the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of dementia. Design and Methods: Clinical research nurses were trained to carry out evaluations for dementia in the home. We describe the assessment and training procedures used and note the advantages and drawbacks of this approach. Results: Nurse identification of the presence of dementia agreed well with that of medical specialists (kappa = 0.84), but was slightly poorer regarding type of dementia (kappa = 0.71). Implications: Use of nurses for such activity need not be limited to epidemiological studies, but is relevant also in clinical practice. Purpose:\\u2002This article profiles the housing settings of frail elderly individuals, whether their homes are facilitating or impeding their ability to live in the community, and the change in disability and housing status before and after passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. Design and Methods:\\u2002The analysis relies primarily on statistical analysis of the 1995 national American Housing Survey (AHS), with supplementary analysis of the 1978 AHS. Results:\\u2002In 1995, roughly 14% of elderly individuals had a “housing-related disability,” 49% had at least one dwelling modification, and 23% had an unmet need for modifications. Because half those with dwelling modification also reported unmet need, the match between disabling condition and modification, not the presence of modifications, is key. Multivariate results indicate that although unmet need is greater among the poor, lack of modifications is not. Prevalence of modifications nearly doubled between 1978 and 1995. Overall unmet need declined, but some needs were less likely to be met in 1995 than 1978. Implications:\\u2002The analysis highlights the importance of information about housing for understanding the care and service needs of elderly individuals and provides a compelling argument for a minimum dataset on their housing and neighborhood environments. Purpose: We examined whether the presence of a spouse and the frequency of interaction with children, relatives, and friends significantly influence the risk of dying in late life. We assessed these effects separately by gender, controlling for self-reported health. In addition, we examined whether interaction with the co-twin has a different impact on mortality for identical and fraternal twins. Design and Methods: The data set consists of 2,147 Danish twins aged 75 years and older, who were followed prospectively from 1995 to 2001. We modeled the effect of social ties on mortality by using event history analysis. Results: Survival is extended by having a spouse and close ties with friends and the co-twin. However, contact frequency with friends and the co-twin is significant, respectively, only for women and identical twins. Implications: Investigating social relations sheds light on the life span of individuals older than 75 years of age. We stress the importance of social relations beyond the presence of the spouse for survival even at very old ages. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to explore how the introduction of Medicare Part D is changing the operations of long-term-care pharmacies (LTCPs) and nursing homes, as well as implications of those changes for nursing home residents.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed existing sources of information and interviewed stakeholders across various perspectives. We conducted 31 semistructured telephone interviews with key stakeholders between November 2006 and January 2007. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Part D represents a substantial departure from how prescription drugs were previously financed and administered in nursing homes, and nursing home providers and LTCPs have struggled in adapting to some of these changes. Part D increased the variation around formularies and drug management processes for residents at the facility level, creating additional burden on clinical and pharmacy staff and introducing a tension between facilities\\' need to dispense medications quickly and assuring of coverage for those drugs. Nursing home and LTCP stakeholders perceive wide variation across Part D plans in their ability to meet the needs of nursing home residents.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Although LTCPs, nursing homes and their clinicians, and Part D plans will gain experience with the benefit in the nursing home setting over time, stakeholders we interviewed identified a range of longer term issues and questions that merit attention as the benefit proceeds. Purpose: We examined the impact of caregiver neuroticism on longitudinal change in depression among spouse-caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer\\'s disease receiving either enhanced psychosocial treatment or usual care. We were interested in whether high levels of caregiver neuroticism would lead to a diminished response to the enhanced treatment and whether neuroticism affected the longitudinal course of caregiver depression regardless of intervention. Design and Methods: We analyzed data from the NYU Spouse-Caregiver Intervention Study, which randomly assigned caregivers either to an enhanced treatment group that received a comprehensive intervention with counseling, support, and consultation, or to a usual-care control group. The present study analyzed data from 320 caregivers, 160 in each group, who completed the NEO questionnaire. We used random-effects growth curve modeling to examine changes in depression in the first year after intake, examining possible effects of neuroticism on the course of caregiver depression and on response to intervention. Results: Caregivers high in neuroticism showed a worse longitudinal course of depression compared with those low in neuroticism in both the enhanced treatment and usual-care groups after we adjusted for baseline depression as a covariate. Caregivers showed benefits from the enhanced treatment compared with usual care, regardless of neuroticism score. However, caregivers low in neuroticism responded to treatment with declining levels of depression, whereas caregivers high in neuroticism maintained their baseline level of depression. Implications: Caregiver neuroticism is a risk factor for increased caregiver depression over time. High neuroticism does not preclude successful caregiver intervention with a highly individualized intervention like ours, but expectations of outcome should be different than for caregivers low in neuroticism. Future studies should investigate the relationship between neuroticism and response to less individualized interventions and the impact of other personality characteristics on response to treatment. Purpose:\\u2002We estimate the independent contribution of crime victimization to nursing home placement in a cohort of older adults who were community dwelling at baseline.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The data come from an observational cohort study of 2,321 community-residing older adults who were members of the New Haven Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies in the Elderly cohort in 1985. Participants had annual evaluations using standardized instruments. We defined the major outcome, custodial nursing home placement, as a stay of at least 30 days; mean length of nursing home stay was 413 days. We determined crime victimization by matching police records in the same catchment area as the cohort for the period 1985–1995. We determined nursing home placement through linkage to the Connecticut Long Term Care Registry. We used growth curve modeling to estimate the risk of placement in victimized and nonvictimized participants, and we used multivariable models to adjust for other factors known to predict nursing home placement.\\u2003Results:\\u2002There were 482 members of the cohort (21%) who experienced victimization over the 10-year follow-up; 747 (32%) experienced nursing home placement. Most victimization episodes were nonviolent and noninjurious. However, violent victimization conferred an independent increased risk of nursing home placement (odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0–4.6) that exceeded the increased risk associated with other variables traditionally thought to be predictive of placement (such as functional and cognitive impairment, and social network size).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Violent crime victimization increases the risk of nursing home placement. Future research should be directed at determining the mechanism of this increased risk and developing interventions directed at victimized older adults that might avert nursing home placement in this uniquely vulnerable population. Purpose: This study explored how nursing home residents define quality of care. Design and Methods: Data were collected through in-depth interviews and were analyzed using grounded dimensional analysis. Results: Residents defined quality in three ways: (a) Care-as-service residents focused on instrumental aspects of care. They assessed quality using the parameters of efficiency, competence, and value. (b) Care-as-relating residents emphasized the affective aspects of care, defining quality as care that demonstrated friendship and allowed them to show reciprocity with their caregivers. (c) Care-as-comfort residents defined quality as care that allowed them to maintain their physical comfort, a state that required minute and often repetitive adjustments in response to their bodily cues. Implications: Residents\\' perceptions of care quality have implications for long-term care practice. The integration of these perceptions into quality assurance instruments could improve the usefulness of tools designed to obtain resident input. Purpose: This study was undertaken to develop a performance-based instrument to measure a range of function present among nursing home (NH) residents and to establish the reliability and validity of the measures. Design and Methods: Fourteen items integral to daily life in a NH setting were administered to 95 NH residents with sufficient cognitive ability to follow a one-step command at baseline, 1 week later, and 6 months later. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Cronbach\\'s coefficient alpha were calculated for reliability estimates. The Minimum Data Set (MDS), Katz, and Multidimensional Observational Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) were used to establish concurrent validity. Factor analysis, correlation matrices, and other objective criteria were used for item reduction. Results: Test–retest reliability for items ranged between .73 and .93. Factor analysis and correlations between Nursing Home Physical Performance Test (NHPPT) items and scales with measures of activities of daily living (ADL) suggest that the NHPPT taps aspects of gross motor function (Factor 1) and fine motor coordination and task sequencing (Factor 2) required for ADL function and mobility. The NHPPT may also tap aspects of ADL function and mobility not measured by the MDS (r = –.72–.75), MOSES (r = –.82–.84), or Katz (r = –.75–.77) scales. Effect sizes based on mean change scores were larger for the NHPPT scales (.38–.53) than for the other functional scales (.27–.33). Implications: The NHPPT is a reliable performance-based instrument that discriminates among frail NH residents. Further studies are necessary to assess the value of this instrument for prediction and monitoring of functional status in the NH. Purpose:\\u2002This study used epidemiological data of older African Americans and Caucasians living in an urban community to compare those factors associated with active or passive suicidal ideation in each racial group.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using 1990 census data for Brooklyn, New York, we attempted to interview all cognitively intact adults aged 55 or older in randomly selected block groups. The sample consisted of 214 Whites and 860 Blacks. We adapted George\\'s social antecedent model to examine 19 independent variables; the dependent variable was based on lifetime history of passive or active suicidal ideation (hereafter, suicidality). We weighted the sample by race and gender. To control for sampling design effects, we used SUDAAN for data analysis.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Whites reported higher prevalence than Blacks for current suicidality (5.8% vs 2.3%) and lifetime suicidality (14.8% vs 10.2%). None of the differences were significant. In logistic regression analysis conducted for each race, four variables were associated with suicidality within both races: higher depressive symptom scores, higher anxiety symptom scores, copes by using medications, and lower religiosity. Two variables were associated with suicidality only among Whites: higher use of spiritualists and copes by keeping calm. One variable, greater use of doctors for mental health problems, was significant only among Blacks.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002There were no racial differences in the prevalence of suicidality. Virtually all of the factors associated with suicidality are potentially ameliorable. Among both racial groups, suicidality is likely to be impacted by addressing depressive and anxiety symptoms and, when appropriate, by encouraging various coping strategies, especially religiosity. Purpose:\\u2002This article assesses the state of research on assisted living (AL) from 1989 to May 2004.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We undertook keyword searches for AL research and amplified these with searches of Web sites, conference proceedings, and follow-up inquiries. We annotated and coded the resultant items according to categories reflecting the research methods used and the topics studied. We did additional comparisons for 38 studies with quantitative data that permitted summarizing resident characteristics, settings, and entry and move-out patterns.&!emsp;Results:\\u2002The 411 identified items ranged across a large number of topics. Qualitative studies outnumbered quantitative ones, and longitudinal studies were rare. We found little standardization in the way variables were measured, making cross-study comparisons difficult. As AL research has become more common, some items are directed at studying ways to proceed within AL as opposed to globally commenting on the worth of AL as a service sector.Implications:\\u2002The research base for AL has grown rapidly but is still underdeveloped. We recommend using more consistent sets of standardized measures in AL studies and reporting analyses based on them. We also recommend fuller reporting of details on sampling, time frames, and measures in AL research. Purpose:\\u2002Older adults watch more television than younger people do. Television\\'s role in mental health has been described in the general population, but less is known about how older adults think of television in the context of depression.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Using a semistructured interview created to help clinicians understand how older adults conceptualize depression diagnosis and treatment, we conducted a qualitative study of 102 patients aged 65 years or older. We recruited them from primary care offices and interviewed them in their homes. During our analysis, we found that many respondents offered spontaneous thoughts about the relationship between television and depression. We extracted all television-related content from the interview transcripts and identified themes by using grounded theory.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Participants cited television as a way to identify depression in themselves or others (either through overuse or lack of interest) or as a way to cope with depressive symptoms. Some felt that television could be harmful, particularly when content was high in negativity. A substantial number of participants discussed more than one of these themes, and a few mentioned all three. Married people were more likely to discuss television\\'s role in identifying depression. Participants with low education more often mentioned that television could be helpful, whereas those with a history of depression treatment were more likely to discuss television\\'s potential harm.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Researchers should conduct further studies to help them better understand the relationship among depression, television viewing, and individual viewpoints concerning television\\'s role in geriatric depression. An exploration of these issues may yield new approaches to help clinicians address depression in late life. Purpose: This study examined medical students\\' interest in geriatrics: Are knowledge, positive attitudes, and prior experience with older adults associated with an interest in geriatric medicine? Design and Methods:\\u2002Entering University of Michigan medical students completed three surveys: the Revised Facts on Aging Quiz, the University of California at Los Angeles Geriatric Attitudes Scale, and the Maxwell–Sullivan Attitudes Scale. The students were also asked questions about their prior experience with older adults and their interest in geriatric medicine. Results: The results indicate that incoming medical students have minimal knowledge about aging, moderately positive attitudes toward older adults, and low interest in geriatric medicine. Having more positive attitudes toward older adults (ß =.28) and having cared for older persons prior to medical school (ß =.14) were associated with greater interest in geriatric medicine.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings suggest that interventions to increase the number of geriatric-oriented physicians should focus on influencing learners\\' attitudes through experiences in the care of older adults. Purpose: This study assessed overall quality of life of caregivers, using a path model in which burden was conceptualized as distinct from well-being. Design and Methods: Data were drawn from a representative sample of caregivers to dementia and nondementia care receivers in British Columbia, Canada (N = 243). The model used was based on a previously proposed stress/appraisal path model and used multiple regression path estimates. Primary stressors were care receiver cognitive status, physical function, and behavioral problems; the primary appraisal variable was hours of caregiving during the previous week. Mediators were perceived social support, frequency of getting a break, and hours of formal service use; secondary appraisal was subjective burden. The outcome measure was generalized well-being. Results:Well-being was directly affected by four variables: perceived social support, burden, self-esteem, and hours of informal care. Burden was affected directly by behavioral problems, frequency of getting a break, self-esteem, and informal hours of care and was not affected by perceived social support. Discussion: The finding that perceived social support is strongly related to well-being but unrelated to burden reinforces the conceptual distinctiveness of the latter two concepts. This suggests that quality of life of caregivers could be improved even with burden in their lives and that the overwhelming focus in caregiving research on burden should be supplemented with an emphasis on quality of life. Purpose: This exploratory study compared three methods of assessing dementia specific quality of life, corresponding to the perspectives of residents, staff members, and trained observers. Design and Methods: We collected data on 172 residents with dementia in four special care nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities. Analyses assessed the relationship of each quality-of-life method or perspective to the others and to resident characteristics such as cognitive and functional status. Results: The relationship of staff quality-of-life measures to resident characteristics varied by care setting while no significant relationships were found for resident quality-of-life measures. Staff and observational measures were moderately correlated in both settings. Moderate correlations of resident measures with staff and observational measures were found in the assisted living sample. Implications: Each perspective is relatively independent and somewhat unique. Measures that focus on specific aspects of quality of life may be more appropriate to use with assisted living residents than with residents of special care facilities. Purpose: In our study, we sought to improve the accuracy of predicting the risk of hospitalization and to identify older, inner-city patients who could be targeted for preventive interventions. Design and Methods: Participants (56% were African American) in a randomized trial were from a primary care practice and included 1,041 patients living in the inner city who were either ≥75 years of age or were ≥50 years of age with severe disease. As a secondary analysis, we assessed patient characteristics at baseline involving five domains of health, including utilization and satisfaction. We followed participants for 12 months and recorded the occurrence of nonelective hospitalization within the study period. We developed a multivariate model using logistic regression to predict this outcome. Results: The following patient characteristics independently predicted an increased risk for nonelective hospitalization: having the diagnosis of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or anemia; and having more medications prescribed, having a lower body mass index, and having more emergency department visits during the previous year. Better physical functioning reduced the risk of hospitalization. Implications: Moderate accuracy of a prediction model (0.73) was observed. In addition to focusing on patients with chronic disease, helping them maintain physical functioning may help reduce nonelective hospitalization. Purpose:This article presents a rationale and conceptual framework for making comprehensive consumer information about nursing facilities available. Such information can meet the needs of various stakeholder groups, including consumers, family/friends, health professionals, providers, advocates, ombudsman, payers, and policy makers.Design and Methods:The rationale and framework are based on a research literature review of key quality indicators for nursing facilities.Results:The findings show six key areas for information: (a) facility characteristics and ownership; (b) resident characteristics; (c) staffing indicators; (d) clinical quality indicators; (e) deficiencies, complaints, and enforcement actions; and (f) financial indicators. This information can assist in selecting, monitoring, and contracting with nursing facilities.Implications:Model information systems can be designed using existing public information, but the information needs to be enhanced with improved data. Purpose: Prescription medication use is essential to the health and well-being of many elderly persons. However, the cost of medications may be prohibitive and contribute to noncompliance with medical recommendations. This study identifies community-dwelling elders who reported a delay in medication use because of prescription medication cost. Design and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of a nationwide sample of 6,535 elders participating in the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study. Participants reported if they had taken less medication than prescribed or if they had not filled prescriptions because of cost in the past 2 years. This response was then compared with the self-report of multiple variables, including demographic, health status, health insurance coverage, and financial variables. Results: Elders who were most vulnerable to medication delay as a result of cost included those with Medicare coverage only, low income, high out-of-pocket prescription costs, and poor health as well as African American elders and those aged 65–80 years. Implications: This study provides important information about community-dwelling elders that reported a delay in medication use because of cost. As a Medicare prescription benefit has been passed, it will be important to monitor how these changes affect the elders identified at risk for medication delay. Purpose:\\u2003We developed an innovative pilot studies program to foster partnerships between university researchers and agencies serving older people in New York City. The development of researchers willing to collaborate with frontline service agencies and service agencies ready to partner with researchers is critical for translating scientific research into evidence-based practice that benefits community-dwelling older adults.Design and Methods:\\u2002We adapted the traditional academic pilot studies model to include key features of community-based participatory research. \\u2003Results:\\u2002In partnership with a network of 265 senior centers and service agencies, we built a multistep program to recruit and educate scientific investigators and agencies in the principles of community-based research and to fund research partnerships that fulfilled essential elements of research translation from university to community: scientific rigor, sensitivity to community needs, and applicability to frontline practice. We also developed an educational and monitoring infrastructure to support projects.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Pilot studies programs developing community-based participatory research require an infrastructure that can supplement individual pilot investigator efforts with centralized resources to ensure proper implementation and dissemination of the research. The financial and time investment required to maintain programs such as those at the Cornell Institute for Translational Research on Aging, or CITRA, may be a barrier to establishing similar programs. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to describe the Medication Management Instrument for Deficiencies in the Elderly (MedMaIDE) and to provide results of reliability and validity testing.\\u2003Design and Methods:Participants were 50 older adults, aged 65 and older, who lived in the community, took at least one prescription medication, and were then self-medicating. Nonmedical study staff assessed participants in their homes at baseline and 1 week, and a study pharmacist conducted pill counts at baseline and 30 days. The MedMaIDE covers three domains important for ensuring medication compliance (knowledge of medications, how to take medications, and procurement) and yields a total deficiency score. We assessed test–retest and interrater reliability. We assessed validity by comparing the MedMaIDE deficiency scores to 30-day pill count compliance. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The sample was mostly female (72%) and White (56%), with a mean age of 78. Participants were taking an average of 7 prescription drugs, with an average pill count compliance of 70%. The MedMaIDE had very good test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.93) and good interrater reliability (ICC = 0.74). Internal consistency was also strong (Cronbach\\'s alpha =.71). Comparing the MedMaIDE to the pill count with those who were compliant (>80%) versus those that were not, the agreement was 75%. The MedMaIDE was more highly specific and predictive of compliance compared to the pill count.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The MedMaIDE appears to be a reliable and valid instrument for determining if an older adult has deficiencies in managing medications. Purpose:\\u2002Although migration decision making is central to understanding later-life migration, the critical step between migration intentions and mobility outcomes has received only limited empirical attention. We address two questions: How often are intended moves actuated? What factors condition the likelihood that mobility intentions will be actuated?\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We employ data from the 1994–2002 Health and Retirement Study, which is a nationally representative panel targeting households containing persons aged 53 to 63 years at baseline. Event-history techniques are used to examine the link between reported mobility intentions at baseline and mobility outcomes across the study period, net of relevant controls. We conduct separate household-level analyses for couple and noncouple households and recognize three types of moves: local, family oriented, and nonlocal.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Findings confirm the utility of mobility expectations as a predictor of future mobility. More importantly, results highlight the complex nature of later-life mobility. The actuation of mobility intentions appears to operate differently in couple than in noncouple households. Moreover, our findings suggest that the role of several key variables depends on the type of move under consideration.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The ability to identify potential “retirement migrants” may be of practical importance for state and local government officials as well as developers interested in recruiting or retaining young-old residents. Our study offers insight on the interpretation of stated mobility intentions. Moreover, consistent with early theoretical work in the field, our analysis suggests that empirical studies must account for heterogeneity among older movers in order to avoid misleading results. Purpose: This study addressed key concerns that gave rise to the question of whether special guidelines were needed to monitor research at the end of life. Design and Methods: Summary of established ethical and legal guidelines that govern the conduct of research with human subjects, with discussion of issues relevant to populations at life\\'s end. Discussion of whether special guidelines are indicated focuses on four questions concerning: (a) time periods; (b) methods and approaches; (c) informed consent; and (d) obligations of researchers. Results: Although research involving patients at end of life does present important ethical and moral challenges to researchers and should be scrutinized carefully by institutional review boards (IRBs), special guidelines are not required. Implications: Closer examination of the dimensions discussed will enhance the research endeavor and model the qualities for which end-of-life research should become known. Purpose:\\u2002The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has adopted two functional assessment systems that guide care planning: one for nursing home residents (the Resident Assessment Instrument [RAI]) and a compatible one for home care clients (RAI-HC). The purpose of this article is to describe the RAI-HC (often referred to as the Minimum Data Set–Home Care or MDS-HC) and its uses and offer lessons learned from implementation experiences in other settings.\\u2002Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed implementation challenges associated both with the RAI and the RAI-HC in the United States, Canada, and other adopter countries, and drew on these to suggest lessons for the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as other entities implementing the RAI-HC.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Beyond its clinical utility, there are a number of evidence-based uses for the assessment system. The resident-level data can be aggregated and analyzed, and scales identify clinical conditions and risk for various types of negative outcomes. In addition, the data can be used for other programmatic and research purposes, such as determining eligibility, setting payment rates for contract care, and evaluating clinical interventions. At the same time, there are a number of implementation challenges the Department of Veterans Affairs and other organizations may face.\\u2002Implications:\\u2002Policy makers and program managers in any setting, including state long-term-care programs, who wish to implement an assessment system must anticipate and address a variety of implementation problems with a clear and consistent message from key leadership, adequate training and clinical support for assessors, and appropriate planning and resources for data systems. Purpose: This study examined connections (linking, compensatory, or none) between three systems of social support (informal, church, and formal). Predictors of each system were also examined. Design and Methods: A community sample of 187 caregivers who provided care to older African American participants in the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly was used. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine relationships between systems of social support as well as to determine predictors of each social support system. Results: Findings provide evidence for linking connections between systems of support: Informal and formal supports were linked, and church support and formal support were linked. The relationship of need as positively related to social support was limited to the care recipient\\'s number of instrumental activities of daily living limitations being associated with formal support. Level of education was also associated with use of formal support. Implications: Cohesive family networks and network size are important factors that help determine what support caregivers receive. African American caregivers may be at risk for negative health outcomes because they are less likely to use formal support as care recipients\\' activities of daily living limitations increase. Purpose: This study examined age and contextually related factors that are influential in lay referral patterns during cardiac treatment decision making. Design and Methods: A complementary design was used. The Myocardial Infarction (MI) Onset Study identified demographic correlates of who sought medical care for 1,388 MI (heart attack) survivors. Thirty-five in-depth MI illness narratives explicated lay referral patterns. Results: Data revealed a linear association between older age and reliance on another person to seek medical attention for cardiac symptoms, with gender also shaping lay referral patterns. Although spouses and children were the most frequently cited decision makers for older respondents, friends and other family members also influenced care-seeking decisions. Qualitative results substantiated and provided explanations for such patterns. Implications: Our results highlight the need for researchers to attend to the complex social processes of lay consultation and for health education messages to extend to venues where lay cardiac decisions are made, including the worksite and social gathering places such as religious institutions. Enhanced outreach includes tailoring health messages to elders and their significant others and casting a broader net to include nontraditional significant others. Purpose:\\u2002We investigate whether psychological control, conceptually framed within the life-span theory of control by Heckhausen and Schulz, drives assistive device use in visually impaired elders. In particular, we expect the two primary control modes differentiated in the life-span theory of control (i.e., selective primary and compensatory primary control) to be positively related to assistive device use. We present cross-sectional as well as repeated measures analyses. Design and Methods: We assessed a sample of 71 participants (age, M = 79.5 years) suffering from age-related macular degeneration at two measurement occasions covering a 1-year interval. In addition to the application of a standardized control questionnaire based on the life-span theory of control distinctions of different control modes, we measured assistive device use as the reported number of devices used, based on a given list. Results: On the bivariate level, we could find the theoretically expected relation between selective primary control and selective compensatory control only for the analyses at Time 1. We used multiple regression models to acknowledge overlapping variance beneath the different control modes; we did this separately for both measurement occasions. Consistent with our expectation, we found selective primary control to be a significant predictor of assistive device use at Time 1, whereas after a 1-year period of disease progression, compensatory primary control took over at Time 2. Implications: Findings provide empirical support for the assumption that educational programs related to assistive device use in visually impaired elders also should take psychological control issues more strongly into consideration. Purpose: Using the perspectives of age, period, and cohort (APC) effects, this study explored the changes in attitudes toward supporting parents in Taiwan. Design and Methods: Population-representative cross-sectional data taken at 1984, 1990, and 1995 from the Social Change Survey in Taiwan were synthesized. Cohort tables and multi-nominal logistic regression were used to analyze the APC effects. Results: Period and age effects were found in the change in attitudes toward supporting parents. Agreement on living with sons or children has slowly decreased. Younger persons agree more than older ones in attitudes toward parents living with their married son or children. There was a reduction in the differences among cohorts across periods. There was no demonstration of cohort effect in this study. Implications: The results indicate that for married children, living with parents is no longer popular in Taiwan society. Social policy should address the unmet needs of elderly people in assistance with daily living. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of family functioning in the stress process in a sample of caregivers of dementia patients by using a structural family framework. The stress-process model of caregiver distress included family functioning as an intervening variable in the relationship between objective burden and distress. We theorized family functioning to partially mediate the relationship between objective burden and distress and to significantly account for the prediction of distress beyond well-recognized predictors. Design and Methods: One hundred eighty-one family caregivers from the Miami site of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\\'s Caregiver Health project participated in this study. We assessed sociodemographics, burden, depression, anxiety, and perceived health for each caregiver. We measured family functioning by using a multidimensional and observational instrument. We used structural equation modeling to assess the fit of the model for the overall sample and for different caregiver subgroups and to examine whether demographic variables affected the relationships in the model. Results: The results of the study indicated that family functioning significantly contributed to distress in the overall sample and partially mediated the relationship between objective burden and distress. We also found that the stress-process model was adequately fit by the hypothesized relationships between objective burden, family functioning, and distress for the overall sample and all of the subsamples, except for wives. Implications: This study provides support for the structural family approach as an explanatory model for the influence of family functioning on dementia caregivers. Family structural functioning is one contributor to the caregiver stress process. This suggests that interventions targeting structural family problems may reduce caregiver distress. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a new model of health care designed to improve the quality of life and the efficiency of resource use for older adults with multimorbidity.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Guided Care enhances primary care by infusing the operative principles of seven chronic care innovations: disease management, self-management, case management, lifestyle modification, transitional care, caregiver education and support, and geriatric evaluation and management. To practice Guided Care, a registered nurse completes an educational program and uses a customized electronic health record in working with two to five primary care physicians to meet the health care needs of 50 to 60 older patients with multimorbidity. For each patient, the nurse performs a standardized comprehensive home assessment and then collaborates with the physician, the patient, and the caregiver to create two comprehensive, evidence-based management plans: a Care Guide for health care professionals, and an Action Plan for the patient and caregiver. Based in the primary care office, the nurse then regularly monitors the patient\\'s chronic conditions, coaches the patient in self-management, coordinates the efforts of all involved health care professionals, smoothes the patient\\'s transitions between sites of care, provides education and support for family caregivers, and facilitates access to community resources.\\u2003Results:\\u2002A 1-year pilot test in a community-based primary care practice suggested that Guided Care is feasible and acceptable to physicians, patients, and caregivers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002If successful in a controlled trial, Guided Care could improve the quality of life and efficiency of health care for older adults with multimorbidity. Purpose:\\u2002Development of strategies to optimize the functional performance of older adults requires understanding the behavior of older people doing tasks in real-world settings and capturing these interactions in research protocols. This is a major challenge as there is some degree of tension between capturing the contextual variables and constraints that operate in the real world and the scale of research that can be realistically conducted within controlled experimental settings. This article presents a research approach that can be used to help ensure the ecological validity of research protocols. The intent is to demonstrate how an ecologically valid approach affords greater insight into the performance of older adults in real world settings.\\u2003Methods:\\u2002The approach involves techniques such as task analysis and simulation. Examples from two research projects examining aging and the performance of real-world computer-based work tasks are used to demonstrate the application of this approach.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The article demonstrates how an ecologically valid research approach yields information about human performance that can be translated into solutions for real-world problems.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Ecologically valid research protocols offer the potential for providing answers to real-world problems and advancing theory regarding aging and functional performance. Purpose:\\u2002The use of consumer-directed services is expected to grow in coming years, and paying family and friends is a key element of these home-based services. The goal of this study was to understand the careers of these “related workers” (family and friends) and their potential role in the long-term care workforce.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a telephone survey of 383 former paid home care related workers in California\\'s In-Home Supportive Services program. Of these, 203 had left caregiving (Leavers) and 180 had continued in other paid caregiving jobs (Stayers). Questionnaire items covered work histories, current employment, and the initial In-Home Supportive Services work experience.\\u2003Results:\\u2002About 85% of the sample was female, 39% was White, and the average age was 48 years. Findings suggest that Stayers were more like career caregivers in terms of work history, education, earnings, and reasons for taking a job. Leavers were more apt to care for a close relative and to feel they had less choice in accepting the job. Surprisingly, more than 40% of Leavers indicated they would consider paid caregiving again, even for someone not related. Less surprisingly, more than two thirds of Stayers indicated they would.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The growing number of programs that pay family members to provide home-based services are attracting relatives and friends who had not considered home care as a career option. With more outreach and targeted information about home care employment options, these related workers may help solve the long-term care workforce shortage. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined the association among caregiver labor force participation, employees\\' caregiving activities, and the amount and quality of care received by care recipients.\\u2003Design and Methods:Telephone interviews were conducted with 478 adults who were employed full time and 705 nonemployed adults who provided care to a family member or friend aged 50 or older, identified through random sampling of California households. We assessed care recipient impairment and service problems; the amounts and types of assistance received from caregivers, family and friends, and paid providers; and caregiver utilization of support services. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Care recipients of caregivers employed full time were less likely to receive large amounts of care from their caregivers, more likely to receive personal care from paid care providers, more likely to use community services, and more likely to experience service problems than were care recipients of nonemployed caregivers. Employed caregivers were more likely to use caregiver support services than were nonemployed caregivers.\\u2003Implications:Accommodation to caregiver full-time employment involves selective supplementation by caregivers and their care recipients, reflecting increased reliance on formal support services as well as increased vulnerability to service problems and unmet care recipient needs. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to the well-being of disabled elders whose caregivers are employed full time. Purpose:\\u2002In November of 2002 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publicly reported on a national basis the quality of nursing homes on the Nursing Home Compare (NHC) Web site. This study examines administrators\\' opinions of this initiative and whether it has fostered quality improvement.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data used in this investigation come from a questionnaire mailed to the administrators of 477 nursing homes. Three hundred and twenty-four responses were received, giving a response rate of 68%. Facilities were located in four states: Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Ninety percent of the administrators examined the NHC Web site, 51% stated that they would be using the information for quality improvement in the future, and 33% stated that they were using NHC information in quality-improvement initiatives.\\u2003Implications:\\u2003For NHC to influence quality as it is intended, nursing home quality-of-care initiatives are essential. Study results show that administrators are generally accepting of the NHC Web site, and some are using the information in quality initiatives. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among lifetime exposure to traumatic events, emotional support, and life satisfaction in three cohorts of older adults. Design and Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with a nationwide sample of 1,518 older people in 2003. Approximately 500 elders were interviewed in each of the following age cohorts: Young–old (age 65–74), old–old (75–84), and oldest–old (85 and older). Results: The findings suggest that exposure to lifetime trauma is associated with less life satisfaction in all three age cohorts. The data further reveal that emotional support offsets the effects of trauma on feelings of life satisfaction in the old-old and the oldest–old. The stress buffering properties of emotional support were especially evident in the oldest–old cohort. Implications: The findings underscore the need to develop interventions that help older people deal more effectively with lifetime trauma. Moreover, the results suggest that interventions providing emotional support may be especially helpful for the oldest–old. Purpose: We developed and evaluated an explicit procedure for obtaining self-report pain data from nursing home residents across a broad range of cognitive status, and we evaluated the consistency, stability, and concurrent validity of resident responses. Design and Methods: Using a modification of the Geriatric Pain Measure (GPM-M2), we interviewed 61 residents from two nursing homes (Mini-Mental State Examination score, M = 15 ± 7) once a week for 4 consecutive weeks. We collected additional data by means of chart review, cognitive status assessments, and surveys of certified nursing assistants. We used descriptive and correlational analyses to address our primary aims. Results: Eighty-nine percent of residents completed all four scheduled interviews. Cognitive status was not significantly correlated with number of nonresponses and prompts for yes–no questions, but it was significantly correlated with nonresponses and prompts for Likert-scale questions (r = −.48, p <.001 and r = −.59, p <.001, respectively). Completion time for the 17-item pain measure (M = 13 min) was not predicted by cognitive status. Residents\\' scores on the GPM-M2 were significantly correlated with number of chronic pain-associated diagnoses, r =.37, p <.01, and internal consistency was excellent, α = 0.87 − 0.91. Residents\\' GPM-M2 scores were stable over time, r =.74–.80, p <.0001, for all comparisons. Implications: Using explicit protocols and reporting procedural data allows researchers and clinicians to better understand and apply results of self-report studies with cognitively impaired elders. Results suggest that many nursing home residents can provide consistent and reliable self-report pain data, given appropriate time and assistance. Purpose: This article reviews the effectiveness of a new training program for improving nursing staffs\\' detection of depression within long-term care facilities. The course was designed to increase recognition of the Minimal Data Set (MDS) Mood Trigger items, to be brief, and to rely on images rather than didactics. Design and Methods: This study used a delayed intervention design. Twenty nurses from two facilities participated in all four sessions of the study. Results: Staff exposed to the intervention (Site 1) improved significantly in their ability to detect mood symptoms in videotaped patients after completing the training course compared with those exposed to the delayed intervention (Site 2). Improvement in detection skills at Site 2 following the training confirmed the intervention\\'s utility. The improvement was demonstrated across levels of staff (licensed and unlicensed). Maintenance of skills was demonstrated at the 4-month follow-up. Implications: Staff successfully improved knowledge and skill of MDS mood triggers. This method may lend itself to other MDS domains. Purpose: The purpose of this project was to develop a reliable and valid family satisfaction instrument for use in Ohio\\'s nursing homes. Design and Methods: Investigators worked with an advisory council to develop the survey. Purposive sampling techniques were largely used to select 12 small, medium, and large for-profit and proprietary facilities in one large county for the pretest. A total of 239 families who were “most involved” in their relative\\'s care completed an instrument with 97 satisfaction items. Results: Factor analyses identified nine factors that explained 59.44% of the variance in satisfaction. Investigator judgment modified some factors and developed scales. The scales had good internal reliability (\\u2060 \\\\({\\\\alpha}\\\\ {=}.76\\\\)  and above, except for one), test–retest reliability ranged from.49 to.88, and differences between families of short- and long-stay residents were in expected directions. A final instrument with 62 satisfaction and 17 background items was recommended for statewide implementation. Implications: Findings from the project can be used to further refine the instrument and protocols for use with larger populations in other states and by the federal government. Purpose: We examined the extent to which the substituted judgments made by spouses of patients with end-stage renal disease actually reflect patient preferences. Design and Methods: We used data from 291 couples to compare dialysis patients\\' preferences for continuing hemodialysis under a variety of hypothetical situations with both substituted judgment data from spouses and information about spouses\\' own preferences. Results: Substituted judgments were more highly related to spouses\\' preferences than to patients\\' preferences. Implications: Findings raise questions about the extent to which the moral principle of patient autonomy should guide decision making at the end of life. Purpose: This study examined the decision-making capacity of persons with cognitive impairment with respect to their everyday care preferences and choices. This is the first in a series of articles to report on findings from a larger study that examines choice, decision making, values, preferences, and practices in everyday care for community-dwelling persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers. Design and Methods: Fifty-one respondent pairs, or dyads, were interviewed, that is, persons with cognitive impairment (n = 51) and their family caregivers (n = 51). All persons with cognitive impairment were interviewed twice within a week using a parallel interview to determine stability and accuracy of responses. The family caregiver was interviewed once. Results: Persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (i.e., Mini-Mental State Exam scores 13–26) are able to respond consistently to questions about preferences, choices, and their own involvement in decisions about daily living, and to provide accurate and reliable responses to questions about demographics. Implications: Including the perspective of persons with cognitive impairment in both research and practice has the potential to enhance their autonomy and improve their quality of life. Purpose:\\u2002“Medication administration hassles” are the minor daily irritants that family caregivers experience when they assist a dependent family member with medication regimens. This study was designed to develop and test a multidimensional measure of the hassles in family caregiver medication administration. Design and Method:\\u2002The authors employed a multiphase process (caregiver focus groups, instrument development, pilot testing, and field testing). Approximately 180 family caregivers representing diverse socioeconomic circumstances and racial or ethnic backgrounds participated in the study. The final version of the instrument consists of 24 items and four subscales: Information Seeking/Information Sharing (9 items, α =.92), Safety Issues (5 items, α =.83), Scheduling Logistics (7 items, α =.90), and Polypharmacy (3 items, α =.80). Overall scale reliability is.95, and test–retest reliability at 2 weeks is.84. Implications:\\u2002Caregiver medication administration hassles represent a complex, multidimensional construct that warrants consideration in studies of contemporary family caregiver stress, strain, and burden. Purpose: Consumers and providers demand better indicators for quality of care and quality of life at the end of life. This article presents recommendations for advancing the science of measurement at end of life. Design and Methods: The authors reviewed the extant literature and applied the Institute of Medicine\\'s conceptual framework for national health care quality to end-of-life care and research. Results: Ten recommendations were developed, charting a course for research that will improve the quality of care delivered and, consequently, the quality of life experienced at life\\'s end. Implications: Measurement bridges the conceptual and operational levels of scientific research, clinical care, and quality improvement. Although a large amount of psychometric groundwork has been laid in the field of end-of-life research, the next wave of studies will ideally take measurement at end of life to a higher level of rigor and precision. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the role of cognitive and instrumental functional performance in driving cessation while simultaneously accounting for any contributions of demographics, vision, physical performance, and health among a sample of older adults without dementia.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Included in the analyses were 1,838 participants from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study who were drivers at baseline and completed the third-year assessment. Participants completed baseline assessments of sociodemographic characteristics, health, sensory function, physical function, cognitive abilities, instrumental functional performance, and depressive symptoms. Driving status was again ascertained 3 years later.Results:\\u2002We used Cox proportional hazard analyses to examine prospective predictors of driving cessation over a 3-year period. The final model indicated four significant risk factors for driving cessation: older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06, p =.009), poorer balance as measured by the Turn 360° test (HR = 1.17, p =.002), slower cognitive speed of processing as measured by the Useful Field of View test (HR = 1.37, p =.004), and poorer instrumental functional performance as assessed by the Everyday Problems Test (HR = 1.59, p <.001).\\u2003Implications:Although vision, health, and physical abilities are commonly considered when determining driving capacity, cognitive speed of processing and instrumental functional performance may be better indicators of subsequent likelihood of driving cessation across 3 years among older adults. Poor health and vision may only impact driving cessation to the extent that cognitive speed of processing and instrumental functioning are affected. Purpose:The authors examine the bibliographic structure of recent research on later-life migration, highlighting the contributions of particular journals and disciplines.Design and Methods:The authors identify the primary journals publishing research in this area, including a set of four core journals within the field of social gerontology. They evaluate the disciplinary affiliations of authors publishing in the core journals and the extent to which those journals cite relevant research published elsewhere.Results:Geographical and economic perspectives on later-life migration are underrepresented within the core journals of social gerontology. In particular, major articles published outside the core journals are seldom cited within those journals.Implications:Although the core journals of social gerontology account for over a third of the recent literature on later-life migration, they present only a partial (chiefly sociological) perspective on the subject. Purpose:\\u2002Remembering medical treatment information may be particularly taxing for older cancer patients, but to our knowledge this ability has never been assessed in this specific age group only. Our purpose in this study was to investigate older cancer patients\\' recall of information after patient education preceding chemotherapy.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We constructed a recall questionnaire consisting of multiple-choice questions, completion items, and open-ended questions related to information about treatment and recommendations on how to handle side effects. Immediately after a nursing consultation preceding chemotherapy treatment, 69 older patients (M = 71.8 years, SD = 4.1) completed the questionnaire. We checked recall against the actual communication in video recordings of the consultations.\\u2003Results:\\u2002On average, 82.2 items were discussed during the consultations. The mean percentage of information recalled correctly was 23.2% for open-ended questions, 68.0% for completion items, and 80.2% for multiple-choice questions.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Older cancer patients are confronted with a lot of information. Recall of information strongly depended on question format; especially active reproduction appeared to be poor. To improve treatment outcomes, it is important that cancer patients are able to actively retrieve knowledge about how to prevent and recognize adverse side effects and that this is checked by the health professional. We make suggestions on how to make information more memorable for older cancer patients. Purpose: This study examines the direct and indirect relationships between individual components of nutritional risk and increased severity of disability among a large and diverse sample of homebound older adults. Design and Methods: Using routinely collected nutrition and function data, structural equation modeling of recursive and nonrecursive models examined the interrelationships of nutritional risk factors, indicators of nutritional risk, and disability severity among 1,010 home-delivered meals program participants in Wake County, NC. Results:The equally good fit for both the recursive and nonrecursive structural models revealed that specific nutritional risk factors were directly and indirectly associated with indicators of nutritional risk and increased severity of disability. The nonrecursive model also revealed significant reciprocal associations of increased disability with unintended weight change and medication use. Implications: The findings from this study acknowledge aspects of the complex direct and indirect relationships between nutrition and function among homebound older persons. This knowledge will help service providers with the development of effective elderly nutrition programs with nutritional and functional status outcomes. Purpose: The Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC), a symptom and quality-of-life inventory, was developed among community-dwelling adults under age 65. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and validity of an interview format of the PAC for older adults residing in long-term care. Design and Methods: The PAC was administered to 24 nursing home residents aged 65 and older. Cognitive interviewing methods were used to evaluate subjects\\' understanding and interpretation of PAC items. Results: The PAC interview required an average of 11 min, 15 s, to complete. Administration modifications for this population included rereading Likert anchor points and the stem question for each item. Subject item interpretation was generally accurate, as was interpretation of Likert anchors. Implications: The PAC is easily administered and well understood by older adult residents in long-term care and provides a brief method for obtaining constipation-specific symptom and quality-of-life data from this population. Purpose:\\u2002On the basis of the experience of an extensive community-based research partnership in New York City, we developed an innovative process for bridging the gap between aging-related research and practice, using a consensus-workshop model.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We adapted the traditional scientific consensus-workshop model to include translation of the research into nontechnical language and the involvement of practitioners in the process. We then applied the model to the specific issue of falls prevention among community-dwelling older adults.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The dialogue and interaction among researchers and practitioners provided new insights beyond a traditional research review. Practitioners offered astute guidance for future research based on their day-to-day field experience. Implications:\\u2002The recommendations that emerged from the workshop demonstrated the value of close interaction between the aging-related research and practice communities. The consensus-conference model has significant potential to establish a bridge between the worlds of research and practice in a variety of settings. The Early Alert Alzheimer\\'s Home Screening Test (AHST) is a variant of the Smell Identification Test (SIT) and the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), and recently became available for purchase by the general public. The validity and the practical utility of routine screening for individuals with asymptomatic cognitive impairment has not been established. There are considerable specific methodological concerns regarding the use of the AHST including the association of olfactory impairment with (a) age in the absence of cognitive impairment, (b) numerous acute and/or chronic medical conditions, and (c) lifestyle habits and social and/or demographic variables. General public misunderstanding of the difference between a screening and a diagnostic test, primary care physicians\\' frequent confusion about follow-up mechanisms for newly diagnosed patients with dementia, the possible lack of perceived counseling options for those self-diagnosed, and abuse of test findings create distinct possibilities for misuse of this test. The marketing of the AHST and its general use without appropriate public health educational safeguards is inappropriate and may be unethical. Purpose:Assisted living is an increasingly important residential setting for the frail elderly person. How often and why residents leave such facilities are important issues for consumers, for clinicians advising frail patients on their options for living arrangements, and for policymakers. This research investigated the impact of facility and individual characteristics on residents\\' departures from assisted living.Design and Methods:This research is based on data on 1,483 residents in a nationally representative sample of 278 assisted living facilities (ALFs). Analyses of these data from 1998 and 1999 especially focused on those residents who left a study ALF between baseline and follow-up data collection. Multinomial logit models were estimated to investigate the impact of facility and individual factors on residents\\' status at follow-up.Results:Over three quarters of those leaving their baseline ALF did so because they needed more care. The multivariate analyses indicated that poorer functional status and being married affected residents\\' relative odds of death before follow-up. Moving to another setting, other than a nursing home, was more likely for residents in for-profit ALFs. Functional status, cognitive status, and the presence of a full-time RN affected residents\\' odds of moving from an ALF to a nursing home.Implications:Both facility-level and individual-level factors affected residents\\' relative odds of leaving an ALF. The findings with the most potentially interesting policy implications are those concerning the factors that affected residents\\' relative likelihoods of entering a nursing home. Purpose:\\u2003In this study, we conducted the first evaluation of assisted vacations for persons with dementia and their caregivers in the field of caregiving research.Design and Methods:\\u2003We used a quasi-experimental, two-group, repeated measures design with two measuring times (preintervention, 3-month follow-up) to examine whether assisted vacations lead to a reduction in physical complaints and symptoms of depression in family caregivers. The sample consisted of 29 caregiving wives who were providing at-home care for husbands suffering from dementia. We selected the participants in the control group from a waiting list. Outcome measurements were made with the Giessen Subjective Complaints List and the Beck Depression Inventory.\\u2002Results:\\u2003The overall emotional and physical states of the participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in comparison with those of the control group 3 months after the first interview.\\u2002Implications:\\u2003The results show that assisted vacations can have both immediate and longer lasting positive effects on participants\\' health. Assisted vacations can therefore be a way of diminishing the risk of stress disorders for caregiving spouses. Making assisted vacations available to people with dementia and their caregivers is a worthwhile goal for community support facilities working to reduce caregiver burden. Purpose: To provide insight into the contribution of psychological variables in understanding use and nonuse of assistive devices (ADs) for self-care and mobility. Design and Methods: A survey on a representative sample of 491 community-dwelling elderly people in Flanders was conducted. A theoretical model of the factors predicting the use of ADs was tested with path analysis. Results:The possession and use of 32 ADs were found to be bivariately related to intention to use ADs, awareness of ADs, attitude toward AD use, subjective norm regarding AD use, self-efficacy concerning AD use, and socio-demographic characteristics. In regression analyses the intention to use ADs was found to be related to self-efficacy concerning AD use, attitude toward AD use, and subjective norm regarding AD use. Implications: This study suggests that a social–cognitive model of human behavior can be helpful in explaining the use of ADs. The model can suggest measures to be developed aiming to improve the introduction of ADs. Purpose: This study investigated whether the use of restraining devices and related measures of care quality are different in nursing homes that score in the upper and lower quartiles on the Minimum Data Set (MDS) “prevalence of restraint” quality indicator, which assesses daily use of restraining devices when residents are out of bed.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study was a cross-sectional study, with 413 residents in 14 nursing facilities. Eight homes scored in the lower quartile (25th percentile; low prevalence, 0–5%) on the MDS restraint prevalence quality indicator, and six homes scored in the upper quartile (75th percentile; high prevalence, 28–48%). Eight care processes related to the management of restraints and gait and balance problems were defined and operationalized into clinical indicators. Research staff conducted direct observations during three 12-hr days (7 a.m.–7 p.m.) to determine the prevalence of restraining devices and identify resident and staff behaviors that may be affected by restraint use.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Residents in high-restraint homes were in bed during the day on more observations than residents in low-restraint homes (44% vs. 33%; p <.001), were more frequently observed with bed rails in use (74% of residents vs. 64% of residents; p <.03), and received less feeding assistance during meals (2.7 min vs. 4.1 min; p <.001). There were no differences between homes in the use of out-of-bed restraints, nor were there any differences on any care process measure related to the management of restraints, gait and balance problems, or measures of physical or social activity.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A home\\'s score on the MDS-generated prevalence of restraint quality indicator was not associated with differences in the use of restraints, physical activity, or any care process measure when residents were out of bed. However, there were differences in the use of in-bed restraining devices, and residents in high-restraint homes were in bed more often during the day. These differences were associated with poor feeding assistance and reflect important differences in quality of care between homes, even though these differences are not what the restraint prevalence quality indicator purports to measure. Methods to monitor and improve the quality of care related to exercise, in-bed times, and resident freedom of movement are discussed. Maintaining safety in the home and community is a national public health concern, especially for older adults who “age in place.” In this article, we introduce a multicausal concept called “health-related safety,” which is defined as the minimization of the probability of preventable, unintended harm in community-dwelling individuals. Derived from the modern patient safety movement, health-related safety attributes adverse health events in the home and community to systematic breakdowns in the societal system, not to the commission of errors by particular individuals. Extending beyond health care institutions, the health-related safety framework is composed of multiple levels: micro (consumers and providers); mezzo (homes and communities); and macro (policies). Because the societal system is complex with inherent risks, health-related safety will require a culture shift and system redesign, new tools of risk assessments and management, and continuous safety improvement. We propose a research agenda to further refine the health-related safety framework by using empirical evidence and to develop appropriate mathematical and practical models from safety sciences to support this initiative. This article moves the field forward by applying systems thinking and safety sciences to health-related safety in the home and community, thereby paralleling what researchers have begun to do with patient safety in health care systems. Purpose:\\u2002Although the nursing facility transition literature is growing, little research has analyzed the characteristics of individuals so assisted or compared participants to those who remain institutionalized. This article describes an analytic method that researchers can apply to address these knowledge gaps, using the Arkansas Passages nursing facility transition program as a case study.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study employed Arkansas Minimum Data Set 2.0 data for 111 transitioned individuals, a derivation sample of 1,000 other residents, and a validation sample of all residents from the transitioned individuals\\' nursing facilities. Tree classification techniques identified distinct groups of transitioned and nontransitioned residents.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Nearly two thirds of transitionees were part of a group comprising only 1.5% of all Arkansas nursing facility residents. Five characteristics identified this group: age, day of stay (i.e., current day of stay at the time of the assessment), having hemiplegia/paraplegia, cognitive impairment level, and classification into one of eight Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) case-mix groups associated with the least nursing staff time. Another group containing 92% of the transitionees comprised 22% of all residents. Two characteristics identified this group: being younger than age 65 or being in the eight low-resource RUG-III groups.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Given that the majority of individuals assisted by this pilot represent a small and unusual nursing facility subpopulation, policy makers may wish to exercise caution in utilizing these data to forecast future transition populations, costs, or outcomes. Replicating this analysis using additional states\\' data could increase understanding about the characteristics of those assisted across transition programs and could help construct a more robust definition of what constitutes a transition success. Purpose: To study the effect of depression (high levels of depressive symptoms) on social engagement. Design and Methods: In 65 nursing homes in the Netherlands, 562 newly admitted residents were assessed at admission. Social engagement was measured with the MDS Index of Social Engagement. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to study the effect of depression, measured according to the MDS-depression rating scale and controlled for confounders, on social engagement. Results: Fifty-one percent of the newly admitted residents had a low level of social engagement; twenty seven percent were depressed (high levels of depressive symptoms). Residents with a depression were significantly more often found to have low social engagement (OR 3.3), and confounders did not influence the strength of this relationship. Low social engagement on admission is predicted by depression and low cognitive performance, and to a lesser extent by impairments in vision and ADL. Implications: Low social engagement is very common in newly admitted nursing home residents, and depression is an important independent risk factor. The Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) is now used extensively for regulatory, reimbursement, research, and clinical purposes in home health care. However, little is known about the interrater reliability of OASIS items based on assessments from home-health-agency clinicians. Therefore, we evaluated OASIS item interrater reliability among 88 patients from 21 agencies. Of 25 items studied, all except 2 had weighted kappa values of κ ≥ 0.60. We conclude that OASIS item interrater reliability was highly adequate in this study, but we recommend routine interrater-reliability evaluation by agencies to maximize the quality of OASIS data nationally. Purpose: This study examined attitudes of caregivers and physicians toward assessing and diagnosing dementia, with an emphasis on how a diagnosis is disclosed. Design and Methods: Seventeen focus group interviews were conducted with caregivers or physicians from three sites; 52 caregivers participated in nine interviews (three each at the three sites), and 39 physicians participated in eight interviews (three each at two sites; two at one site). Structured interview protocols were used to assess diagnostic disclosure, first reactions, and suggestions for improving the diagnostic process. Results: Caregivers recounted a highly negative emotional response to the disclosure, whereas many physicians reported that families handled the information well. Caregivers expressed a range of preferences for how the diagnosis should have been disclosed, from a direct approach to having the physician ease them into the results. Implications: Whenever possible, physicians should consult with the patient and family at the outset of the diagnostic process to better understand their preferences for diagnostic disclosure. Addressing diagnostic disclosure as part of physician education programs on dementia is recommended. Purpose:\\u2002For depressed older primary care patients, this study aimed to examine (a) characteristics associated with depression treatment preferences; (b) predictors of receiving preferred treatment; and (c) whether receiving preferred treatment predicted satisfaction and depression outcomes. Design and Methods: Data are from 1,602 depressed older primary care patients who participated in a multisite, randomized clinical trial comparing usual care to collaborative care, which offered medication and counseling for up to 12 months. Baseline assessment included demographics, depression, health information, prior depression treatment, potential barriers, and treatment preferences (medication, counseling). At 12 months, services received, satisfaction, and depression outcomes were assessed. Results: More patients preferred counseling (57%) than medication (43%). Previous experience with a treatment type was the strongest predictor of preference. In addition, medication preference was predicted by male gender and diagnosis of major depression (vs dysthymia). The collaborative care model greatly improved access to preferred treatment, especially for counseling (74% vs 33% in usual care). Receipt of preferred treatment did not predict satisfaction or depression outcomes; these outcomes were most strongly impacted by treatment condition. Implications: Many depressed older primary care patients desire counseling, which is infrequently available in usual primary care. Discussion of treatment preferences should include an assessment of prior treatment experiences. A collaborative care model that increases collaboration between primary care and mental health professionals can increase access to preferred treatment. If preferred treatment is not available, collaborative care still results in good satisfaction and depression outcomes. Purpose:\\u2002Turnover among direct-care workers (DCWs) continues to be a challenge in long-term care. Both policy makers and provider organizations recognize this issue as a major concern and are designing efforts to reduce turnover among these workers. However, there is currently no standardized method of measuring turnover to define the scope of the problem or to assess the effectiveness of interventions. This article draws on our experience of the Better Jobs Better Care Demonstration (BJBC) to explicate some important issues in measuring and interpreting turnover related to interventions designed to improve DCW jobs.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used turnover data from a selected group of BJBC providers (N = 9) to demonstrate some of the measurement issues we uncovered in developing a turnover tracking system for BJBC. We also illustrate how the data elements collected in the tracking system make it possible to construct measures that are useful at both policy and practice levels.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Differences in definitions of turnover and the data elements used to construct the measure can have large effects on turn over rates, how they are used, and what they mean.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Policy makers, researchers, and managers who need comparative turnover information to address the impending demand for DCWs should be aware that turnover measures differ, and they should take steps to ensure that measures they use have common definitions and data elements. Purpose:\\u2002In contrast to controlled laboratory- or clinic-based research that can fail to capture the real-world behaviors of older adults, field research offers the best opportunity for ecological validity. However, the tradeoff inherent in field studies is the potential sacrifice of scientific rigor. Applied research presents a unique set of challenges that vary with context. This article discusses these challenges along with possible solutions.\\u2003Design:\\u2002Examples are drawn from an ongoing, longitudinal Roybal Center study of driving competence that is being conducted in Department of Motor Vehicles field sites. The challenges faced at each stage of the project are discussed.\\u2003Method:\\u2002Methodological issues include identifying field collaborators, approaching administrators with the research proposal, producing a battery that is manageable and acceptable while maintaining scientific merit, training indigenous personnel to administer this battery, introducing the research and consenting potential participants, and managing large data sets offsite. Additional issues include quality control, the importance of distinguishing between individuals who consent and those who decline participation, and the collection of follow-up data via telephone.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The use of field research in changing public perceptions, medical practice, and public policy is discussed. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports on the findings of a study whose purpose was to explore the experiences of caregivers of gay and lesbian seniors living in the community and to identify issues that emerged from an exploration of access to and equity in health care services for these populations.\\u2003Design and Methods: The study used a qualitative methodology based upon principles of grounded theory in which open-ended interviews were undertaken with 17 caregivers living in three different cities across Canada.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Findings indicated several critical themes, including the impact of felt and anticipated discrimination, complex processes of coming out, the role of caregivers, self-identification as a caregiver, and support.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We consider several recommendations for change in light of emerging themes, including expanding the definition of caregivers to be more inclusive of gay and lesbian realities, developing specialized services, and advocating to eliminate discrimination faced by these populations. Leading members of the gerontological community have recently launched a war on anti-aging medicine, seeking to discredit what they judge to be fraudulent and harmful products and therapies, and to distinguish their research from what they regard as the pseudoscience of the anti-aging movement. This article interprets the contemporary war on anti-aging medicine as largely an attempt by established gerontological researchers to preserve their hard-won scientific and political legitimacy, as well as to maintain and enhance funding for research on the basic biological mechanisms of aging. First, it recounts the difficult struggle of U.S. biogerontologists to join the scientific mainstream in terms of legitimization and public funding. Second, it examines how elements of a contemporary anti-aging movement seem to threaten the hard-won public legitimacy of established gerontological researchers and practitioners. Third, it looks at the “boundary work” responses of the gerontological community to the anti-aging movement. Finally, it assesses the consequences of the war on anti-aging medicine to date. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of wages and benefits (relative to other jobs available to workers), controlling for personal characteristics, on the recruitment and retention of providers working in a consumer-directed home care program.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002I used the results of focus groups to design a survey that was administered to 2,260 workers stratified by ethnicity and working in eight California counties that represented the range of wage and benefit packages available. I used logistic regression to measure the effect of wage and benefit levels, controlling for covariates, on home care workers\\' stated reason for entering and remaining in the job.\\u2003Results:\\u2002\\u2002Two thirds of respondents reported that commitment to their consumer was the most important reason why they took the job and flexibility was the second most important reason, regardless of wages and benefits and personal characteristics. However, in the county in which very part-time workers were eligible, health insurance was the most important reason for retention. Wage levels above $9 an hour mattered somewhat, especially where the increase was recent. Family providers responded to wage and benefit incentives similarly to non-family providers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002To improve recruitment and retention of consumer-directed home care workers, jobs should be flexible and provide affordable health insurance for part-time workers. The effect of wages suggests that recruitment might be improved with higher wages, but only when they reach the $9 to $10 range (in 2004 dollars). Finally, policy must recognize that family caregivers have financial needs similar to non-family caregivers. Purpose.\\u2002The overall aims of this study are to describe the life stressors of, exposure to illegal drug use of, and illegal drug use by older methadone clients.\\u2003Design and Methods.\\u2002The current study focuses on a subsample of the larger administrative data of a methadone clinic that is limited to African American and White clients over the age of 50 (N = 143). A logistic regression model tested the relationship between life stressors, exposure to illegal drug use, and a respondent\\'s ability to remain abstinent from illegal drug use in the previous month.\\u2003Results.\\u2002Older methadone clients exposed to illegal drug use in their social networks and neighborhoods were significantly more likely to use illegal drugs in the last month.\\u2003Implications.\\u2002Although demographic trends in the methadone population indicate that this cohort is aging and that their numbers are growing, little research exists on their well-being and service needs. Purpose:\\u2002We present final outcomes from the multiple-component Fit and Strong! intervention for older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of this exercise and behavior-change program followed by home-based reinforcement (n = 115) with a wait list control (n = 100) at 2, 6, and 12 months. Fit and Strong! combined flexibility, aerobic walking, and resistance training with education and group problem solving to enhance self-efficacy for exercise and maintenance of physical activity. All participants developed individualized plans for long-term maintenance. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Relative to controls, treatment participants experienced statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy for exercise (p =.001), minutes of exercise per week (p =.000), and lower extremity stiffness (p =.018) at 2 months. These benefits were maintained at 6 months and were accompanied by increased self-efficacy for adherence to exercise over time (p =.001), reduced pain (p =.040), and a marginally significant increase in self-efficacy for arthritis pain management (p =.052). Despite a substantially smaller sample size at 12 months, significant treatment-group effects were maintained on self-efficacy for exercise (p =.006) and minutes of exercise per week (p =.001), accompanied by marginally significant reductions in lower extremity stiffness (p =.056) and pain (p =.066). No adverse health effects were seen. Effect sizes for self-efficacy for exercise and for maintenance of physical activity were 0.798 and 0.713, and 0.905 and 0.669, respectively, in the treatment group at 6 and 12 months.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This consistent pattern of benefits indicates that this low-cost intervention is efficacious for older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis. Although the nearly one in seven Americans who have disabilities share many characteristics, the attitudes toward and the programs, care models, expenditures, and goals for people with disabilities differ substantially across age groups in ways that suggest ageism. Expenditures per recipient are substantially higher for younger individuals with disabilities, largely as a result of more effective advocacy. Programs that are rejected by younger people with disabilities are considered mainstream for older adults. As demographic, social, and economic circumstances change, preserving the programmatic separation will become more problematic. Increased competition for finite resources may motivate a closer examination of commonalities across disabilities in an effort to achieve greater equity. Purpose: The Positively Aging® program is an innovative set of interdisciplinary teaching materials that uses examples from geriatrics and gerontology to teach sixth through eighth grade curricular elements. The purpose of this study was to determine if use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials by regular classroom teachers could change middle school students\\' images of elders. Design and Methods: At the beginning of the 1998–1999 school year, students at two San Antonio, Texas, middle schools were asked to draw a typical older person. These drawings were coded as positive, neutral, or negative portrayals of elders. One school then used the Positively Aging® materials as part of the curriculum; the other school served as the control. Second drawings were obtained from the students at the end of the school year and compared to those from baseline. Results: Both drawings were completed by 60% of students at the intervention school and 55% of students at the control school. Of the 782 paired drawings from the intervention school, 34% were more positive at Time 2 compared to 25% of 591 paired drawings from the control school (χ2 = 13.9, p < .001). In addition, only 20% of the second drawings from the intervention school were more negative than the first drawing compared to 27% from the control school (χ2 = 11.3, p < .001). Using a generalized logit model, we adjusted for each student\\'s baseline drawing (positive–neutral–negative), grade level, gender, ethnic group, and socioeconomic status. After adjustment, students in the intervention school were more likely to draw positive (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 1.94) or positive and neutral images (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.21, 2.19) at follow-up compared to the control school. Implications: This controlled study demonstrated that use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials and activities moved middle school students toward a more positive view of elders. Interdisciplinary teaching materials based on geriatrics and gerontology can be successfully developed and tested in public school systems to affect attitudes about aging. Purpose:This study investigates gender differences in the association between self-rated health (SRH) and mortality. This association has been well-documented, but findings regarding gender differences are inconsistent. The specific objectives were (a) to examine these differences in a short and a long time frame, (b) to examine these differences among old and old-old people, and (c) to address the question of whether this association is based on the accuracy of poor SRH as a predictor of future decline, and/or of better SRH as a predictor of longevity.Design and Methods:The study is based on an Israeli nationally representative sample of 622 women and 730 men who were interviewed about their SRH, as well as sociodemographic information and other measures of health, physical functioning, cognitive status, and depression.Results:For both genders, SRH was associated only with shorter term mortality (within the next 4 years) and not with longer-term mortality (9 years of follow-up). This association was strongest among the old (ages 75–84) women, compared with the old men and with the old-old (85–94) women and men. A possible explanation may be related to differences in the accuracy of excellent SRH at very old age.Implications:The SRH–mortality association may differ among age and gender groups. Identifying the conditions under which it is more accurate will enable researchers and practitioners to know when it can be utilized. It is important to assess differences in the accuracy of poor SRH as well as of excellent SRH as predictors of future health outcomes. This article considers developments and directions for environmental gerontology drawing on the three papers in this Forum. The multidisciplinary field came of age during the 1960s with Powell Lawton\\'s powerful environmental press paradigm and its applications to empirical research and building design. Recent theoretical developments in Europe and America have advanced and integrated concepts in psychology, geography, and related disciplines. Time dimensions and active use of space are essential for understanding aging individuals and microenvironments as well as changing populations and macroenvironments. Research on residential environments by health professions is informing community care that is enhancing the independence and well-being of older people. With its proven responsiveness to social and policy priorities, environmental gerontology is now providing strong conceptual and empirical bases for advancing healthy aging and age-friendly societies. Purpose: We tested the effectiveness of a brief educational program that is based on proactive coping theory. The program entails a four-session group intervention for people aged between 50 and 75 years and was intended to improve proactive coping competencies. Furthermore, we investigated the positive as well as negative side effects and differential effectiveness of the program. Design and Methods: A total of 158 middle aged and older men and women participated in the study. In a prospective randomized control trial with an experimental group and a waiting control group, we collected questionnaire data at three points (baseline, after completion of the program, and 3 months postintervention). Results: The program improved proactive coping competencies significantly. Three months after completion of the intervention, these results remained stable. Nearly all effect sizes in the experimental group were medium or higher. The program did not have negative side effects in terms of worrying or negative mood, and it did not change levels of self-efficacy. Demographic characteristics of participants did not predict changes in proactive competencies. Differential effectiveness could only be shown for a few psychological characteristics: Lower levels of well-being, higher levels of proactive orientation, and lower levels in the consideration of future consequences of one\\'s own behavior predicted an increase in proactive coping competencies. Participants who formulated personal goals in concrete terms also profited more from the intervention. Implications: Conceptualizing proactive coping as a set of competencies allows the translation of this approach into interventions. Competencies that facilitate future-oriented self-regulation can be improved by a brief educational program in middle and late adulthood. Purpose: This study has two purposes. First, it determines if there is a relationship between body weight and the onset of functional impairment across time among this sample of older adults. More specifically, it examines if obese older adults are more likely to experience the onset of functional impairment. Second, it explores how health behaviors and health conditions may explain the relationship between body weight and the onset of functional impairment. Design and Methods: With the use of longitudinal data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) survey, logistic regression models on the onset of functional impairment over two time points are estimated for older adults. Results: Results indicate that body weight (more specifically being overweight or obese) makes one more likely to experience the onset of functional impairment across various domains of impairment. Outside of health behaviors and health conditions, obesity has an independent effect on the onset of impairment in strength, lower body mobility, and activities of daily living. Implications: Study findings support the active treatment of weight problems in older adults. Future directions for research in this area should address effective weight management interventions targeting issues related to older individuals. Purpose: This article examines family caregiver burden after placement of a relative with Alzheimer\\'s disease or a related dementia in a nursing home. Design and Methods:A systems-oriented contextual approach was used to study burden in 276 family caregivers. Results: SAS PROC MIXED analysis showed burden to be associated with caregiver age, length of time involved in caregiving, custodial units, involvement in hands-on care, and expectations for care. Implications: The findings suggest that more services aimed at relieving caregiver burden after nursing home placement may be warranted, particularly so for caregivers who are older and for those who had a shorter length of involvement in direct caregiving before institutionalization. Purpose:\\u2002We investigated whether patient-centered instructions for chronic heart failure medications increase comprehension and memory for medication information in older adults diagnosed with chronic heart failure.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Patient-centered instructions for familiar and unfamiliar medications were compared with instructions for the same medications from a chain pharmacy (standard pharmacy instructions). Thirty-two adults (age, M = 63.8) read and answered questions about each instruction, recalled medication information (free recall), and then answered questions from memory (cued recall).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Patient-centered instructions were better recalled and understood more quickly than the standard instructions. Instructions for the familiar medications also were better recalled. Patient-centered instructions were understood more accurately for the unfamiliar medications, but standard instructions were understood more accurately for the familiar medications. However, the recall measures showed that the advantage of the standard format for familiar medications was short lived.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings suggest that the patient-centered format may improve printed medication instructions available in many pharmacies, which should help older adults to better understand how to take their medications. This article is a brief empirical attempt to identify rural areas in the Southeast United States that have consistently attracted older migrants since 1950 and to ascertain the social, demographic, and geographic characteristics of these areas of destination that differentiate them from otherwise (initially) similar areas. These counties are followed over the successive censuses from 1950 through 1990, identifying those that have consistently experienced elderly in-migration at a rate substantially greater than the overall level. These retirement counties are concentrated in Florida, on the fringes of or adjacent to metropolitan areas or in mountain and coastal locations. The article presents regression analysis of geographic, demographic, and economic/structural correlates of migration. This analysis suggests that retirees are attracted to coastal locations whose existing populations have consistently achieved some measure of prosperity and are not dissimilar from the retirees themselves. Purpose:\\u2002This article describes early efforts of four community partnerships in Boston, El Paso, Houston, and Milwaukee to address governance and management structures in ways that promote the sustainability of innovative community-based long-term care system improvements. The four communities are grantees of the Community Partnerships for Older Adults Program, a national initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that fosters local partnerships to improve long-term care and supportive-services systems in order to meet the current and future needs of older adults. Design and Methods:\\u2002We examined community partnership approaches to governance and management, as well as evidence of the partnerships\\' influence in their communities, by using the conceptual framework of the community health partnerships typology developed by Shannon M. Mitchell and Stephen Shortell.\\u2003Results: Addressing governance and management issues was critical to the early evolution of community partnerships for older adults. Early partnership experiences, particularly with regard to local funders and media, provide evidence of emerging centrality (importance and influence in the community), which forecasts sustainability. Observation over a longer period is needed in order to see whether early successes will be sustained, particularly once original grant funding ends.\\u2003Implications: Community partnerships for older adults can become influential positive forces but must invest in adequate governance and management structures early on. Purpose: This article examines factors that distinguish nursing facilities with very high and very low nursing assistant turnover rates from a middle referent group, exploring the possibility that high and low turnover are discrete phenomena with different antecedents. Design and Methods: Data from a stratified sample of facilities in eight states, with directors of nursing as respondents (N = 288), were merged with facility-level indicators from the On-Line Survey Certification of Automated Records and county-level data from the Area Resource File. Multinominal logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with low (less than 6.6% in 6 months) and high (more than 64% in 6 months) turnover rates. Results: With the exception of registered nurse turnover rate, low turnover and high turnover were not associated with the same factors. Implications: Future studies of facility turnover should avoid modeling turnover as a linear function of a single set of predictors in order to provide clearer recommendations for practice. Purpose:\\u2002We describe the translation of K. R. Lorig and colleagues\\' Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) for delivery in a senior center and evaluate pre–post benefits for African American participants.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Modifications to the CDSMP included a name change; an additional introductory session; and course augmentations involving culturally relevant foods, stress reduction techniques, and communicating with racially/ethnically diverse physicians. We recruited participants from senior center members, area churches, and word of mouth. We conducted baseline and 4-month post-interviews.\\u2003Results:\\u2002A total of 569 African American elders attended an introductory session, with 519 (91%) enrolling in the 6-session program. Of the 519, 444 (86%) completed ≥4 sessions and 414 (79%) completed pre–post interviews. We found small but statistically significant improvements for exercise (p =.001), use of cognitive management strategies (p =.001), energy/fatigue (p =.001), self-efficacy (p =.001), health distress (p =.001), and illness intrusiveness in different life domains (probabilities from.001–.021). We found no changes for health utilization. Outcomes did not differ by gender, number of sessions attended, number and type of chronic conditions, facilitator, leader, or recruitment site.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The CDSMP can be translated for delivery by trained senior center personnel to African American elders. Participant benefits compare favorably to original trial outcomes. The translated program is replicable and may help to address health disparities. Purpose:\\u2002We examine whether the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA) improved nursing home staffing and quality.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data from 5,092 nursing homes were linked across the 1987 Medicare/Medicaid Automated Certification System and the 1993 Online Survey, Certification and Reporting system. A dummy-year model was used to examine the effects of the NHRA on pressure ulcers, physical restraints, and urinary catheters, and a first-difference approach to fixed-effects regression analyses was used to estimate the effects of time-varying staffing on the quality of care.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Overall, we found a significant increase in nursing home staffing levels from 1987 to 1993. Moreover, after controlling for other facility, resident, market, and state factors, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of residents with pressure ulcers, physical restraints, and urinary catheters following the implementation of the NHRA. Across all facilities, the increase in staffing was not directly related to the improvement in quality over the period of our study, but there was a positive relationship between registered nurse staffing and quality for facilities that were particularly deficient prior to the NHRA.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Following the NHRA, quality improvements were found in nursing homes nationwide, and these results suggest that part of this improvement was due to the quality and staffing regulations within the NHRA. Purpose:A focus on palliative care for residents with dementia is much more common in Dutch nursing homes than in the United States. We compared treatment and mortality in U.S. and Dutch nursing home residents with lower respiratory infections (LRI), which are often the immediate cause of death in dementia. Design and Methods:We studied two prospective cohorts—a study of pneumonia (n = 706) conducted in 61 psychogeriatric nursing homes throughout the Netherlands and 701 subjects with likely dementia from a study of LRIs in 36 nursing homes in Missouri. Results:Nursing home residents with dementia were more often treated without antibiotics in the Netherlands (23%) than in Missouri (15%). Indicators of severe illness operate in opposite directions: more severe illness is associated with antibiotic treatment in the United States, but with palliative treatment without antibiotics in the Netherlands.Implications:Our findings are consistent with others in indicating problems with transition to palliative care for U.S. nursing home residents with dementia. Purpose:\\u2002We examined differential effects of cognitive impairment on each of the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tasks. Design and Methods:\\u2002In a 3-year follow-up of community-dwelling elderly persons in Azuchi, Japan, we assessed cognition by using the Hasegawa Dementia Scale. We examined (a) the cross-sectional association between cognitive impairment and functional disability in each ADL–IADL item; (b) cognitive impairment as a risk factor for incident disability in each ADL–IADL item, through logistic regression models; and (c) probabilities of incident loss of ADL–IADL abilities or death in 3 years, using multinomial logistic regression models. We also calculated the population attributable risk (PAR%) of cognitive impairment on incident loss of task-specific ADL–IADL abilities. Results:\\u2002Cross-sectionally, the severity of cognitive impairment was associated with disability in each ADL–IADL task, with larger effects shown for ADL items. Longitudinally, minimally or mildly cognitively impaired individuals had a significantly higher risk of losing functional abilities compared with those with intact cognition. The PAR% indicated that cognitive impairment accounts for 11% to 36% of incident disability in ADL–IADL tasks, with the highest PAR% shown for the ability to feed oneself. Implications:\\u2002Cognitively impaired subjects are heterogeneous; the severity of cognitive impairment has a different impact on incident loss of task-specific ADL–IADL abilities, and comorbidities could affect disabilities differently. Consideration of these heterogeneities will enrich future studies on the impact of cognitive impairment on ADL–IADL abilities. Developments in the realms of medical innovation and geriatric clinical intervention impact our understanding of the nature of late life, the possibilities for health in advanced age, medical decision making, and family responsibility in ways that could not have been predicted 15 years ago. This essay begins to map new forms of biomedicalization in the U.S. and to underscore their emergence in a new ethical field. We suggest that a new kind of ethical knowledge is emerging through “routine” clinical care, and we offer examples from the following interventions: cardiac procedures, kidney dialysis, and kidney transplant. This new ethical knowledge is characterized by the difficulty of saying “no” to life-extending interventions, regardless of age. We explore the intensification of the biomedicalization of old age through a discussion of three features of the new ethical field: (a) the ways in which routine medical care overshadows choice; (b) the transformation of the technological imperative to a moral imperative; and (c) the coupling of hope with the normalization and routinization of life-extending interventions. We argue that societal expectations about longevity and standard medical care come together today in a shifting ethics of normalcy, with unexplored socio-cultural ramifications. Purpose: We reviewed intervention studies that reported dementia caregiver outcomes published since 1996, including psychosocial interventions for caregivers and environmental and pharmacological interventions for care recipients. Our goal was to focus on issues of clinical significance in caregiver intervention research in order to move the field toward a greater emphasis on achieving reliable and clinically meaningful outcomes. Design and Methods: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health databases from 1996 through 2001 were searched to identify articles and book chapters mapping to two medical subject headings: caregivers and either dementia or Alzheimer\\'s disease. Articles were evaluated on two dimensions, outcomes in four domains thought to be important to the individual or society and the magnitude of reported effects for these outcomes in order to determine if they were large enough to be clinically meaningful. Results: Although many studies have reported small to moderate statistically significant effects on a broad range of outcomes, only a small proportion of these studies achieved clinically meaningful outcomes. Nevertheless, caregiving intervention studies have increasingly shown promise of affecting important public health outcomes in areas such as service utilization, including delayed institutionalization; psychiatric symptomatology, including the successful treatment of major and minor depression; and providing services that are highly valued by caregivers. Implications: Assessment of clinical significance in addition to statistical significance is needed in this research area. Specific recommendations on design, measurement, and conceptual issues are made to enhance the clinical significance of future research. Purpose:\\u2002We sought to determine how women aged 80 years or older value different preventive health measures compared to women aged 65 to 79 years.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We surveyed 107 women aged 80 years or older and 93 women aged 65 to 79 years; we randomly selected all of them from a large academic primary care practice. We measured perceived importance and priority placed on different preventive health measures, including screening tests; counseling on healthy lifestyle and geriatric health issues; immunizations; and recommendations for over-the-counter prevention medications.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 200 women, 28.5% were aged 80 to 84 and 25.0% were aged 85 years or older. The majority of the women were non-Hispanic White (65.5%), had private insurance (82.0%), and were in good health condition (52.0%). Women aged between 65 and 79 were more likely than women aged 80 or older to consider screening tests and exercise counseling essential or very important to maintaining their health. Women aged 80 or older did not value any preventive health measure more highly than did younger women. Women who were 65 to 79 years of age ranked mammography screening as their most valued preventive health measure, with five of their top six measures being screening tests. Women who were 85 years of age or older prioritized flu shots, recommendations for aspirin, and then mammography screening.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Screening tests and exercise counseling are more highly valued by women aged 65 to 79 years than by women aged 80 years or older. Regardless of age, mammography screening is prioritized over other preventive health measures. Understanding how older women value different preventive health measures may help clinicians improve their preventive health counseling. Purpose: There is a strong connection between marriage and well-being, with evidence suggesting that the well-being of one spouse is closely correlated with that of the other. However, among older Mexican Americans, there is little information about this phenomenon. To address this, we explore two research questions: Does one spouse\\'s well-being predict the other spouse\\'s well-being? Are there gender differences in these effects? Design and Methods: We assess information from 553 couples who participated in Wave 1 (1993–1994) of the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Using structural equation models, we examined three aspects of well-being among older Mexican American couples: depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and self-rated health. Results: The findings revealed evidence of an association between the well-being of one spouse and that of the other. Specifically, the self-rated health of husbands and wives predicts that of their partners. However, there is evidence that husbands\\' depressive symptoms and life satisfaction influence wives\\' well-being, but not the reverse. Implications: The findings from this study are important because they add to the literature on the connection of well-being among spouses, point to important gender differences, focus on an understudied minority group with unique cultural characteristics, and have implications for the examination of well-being within a marriage framework. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to determine the impact on resource use of providing case managers with information on the potential for patients to benefit from home care services.Design and Methods:Twenty-four case managers working in the Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS) were randomized into treatment and control groups. Members of the treatment group were given patient assessments for 25 ALTCS clients, estimates of the patients\\' risks for various adverse outcomes, and estimates of the aggregate potential benefit for each patient. Members of the control group were given only patient assessments (as is usual practice) for the same sample of 25 clients. Both groups were asked to independently write nonbinding care plans for each patient. The cost of each case manager\\'s care plans was computed by multiplying standard costs per service times the mix and volume of services prescribed for each patient.Results:Treatment group care plan costs were, on average, lower than control group costs and closely tracked variation in estimated patient risks. Comparison group care plan costs were unrelated to risks.Implications:Information about risk and potential benefit can improve targeting of services to long-term-care clients. A prospective study using such an approach is warranted to see if provision of risk and potential benefit information would produce better clinical and economic outcomes. Purpose:\\u2002This study describes the goals, development, and outcomes of an innovative, interdisciplinary, Master of Gerontology department, one of two programs in Israel developed to answer Israel\\'s needs for highly educated researchers and practitioners.\\u2003Design:\\u2002Key program components reflecting the program\\'s innovative nature are described: (a) level of development and promotion of knowledge; (b) goals; (c) influence; and (d) patronage.\\u2003Results:\\u2002An interdisciplinary faculty and student body both report a high satisfaction level, involvement, and the obtainment of wide knowledge bases in gerontology and geriatrics. The number of candidates for the program increases each year. A new unique program for physicians has evolved, with strong support from the University of Haifa, the Council for Higher Education in Israel, and key service organizations for the elderly population.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Such a program enhances the level of professional leadership in the field of aging, and it expands the cadre of academic faculty. This article describes the characteristics associated with activity involvement in 400 residents with dementia in 45 assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Activity involvement was related to family involvement in care and staff encouragement, after adjusting for resident age, gender, race, cognitive and functional status, and comorbidity. Purpose: This study examined gender differences in cardiovascular responses to laboratory-based stress, as well as in ambulatory hemodynamic (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate) functioning among caregivers of persons with dementia. Design & Methods:Participants were 25 men and 25 women caregivers, matched on age, type of care recipient\\'s dementia, and relationship to the care recipient. After cardiovascular reactivity to a laboratory-based caregiving stressor was assessed, the ambulatory hemodynamic functioning levels of caregivers were measured in caregivers\\' natural environments. Results:Female caregivers displayed greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to a laboratory-based stress task (i.e., discussing caregiving difficulties) compared with male caregivers (p ≤ .01). In contrast, no gender differences were found for ambulatory hemodynamic functioning when aggregated overall or when in the presence of the care recipient. Implications: Laboratory-based findings suggest that female caregivers experience greater blood pressure reactivity to caregiving-related stress than do male caregivers. However, these laboratory-based gender differences may not generalize to differences in hemodynamic functioning in caregivers\\' daily lives. Purpose: Although caregivers desire specific information about hospice programs, there is little descriptive information available. We characterized agencies that provide formal or informal hospice care in the United States according to four types of services considered important by caregivers: medications and treatments; rehabilitative care; emotional, social, and spiritual support; and practical support (e.g., continuous home care). Design and Methods: Data were from the nationally representative 2000 National Home and Hospice Care Survey. We categorized agencies into service mixes reflecting combinations of the four service types by using a grade-of-membership model to score each agency.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 11,419 agencies represented in our data, slightly more than half (52%) reflected some mix of services from all four service types. The remaining agencies provided service mixes that reflected relatively few or no services from at least one of the four service types. Specifically, approximately 7% lacked (i.e., had relatively few or no) medications and treatment services, 6% lacked rehabilitative care, 26% lacked emotional/social/spiritual support, and about 10% lacked multiple services. When compared to agencies that reflected a mix of all four services, agencies that lacked multiple services could be distinguished by their lack of formal certification as either a hospice or home health agency. Implications: Few U.S. agencies that provide formal or informal hospice care incorporate a balanced mix of all types of services, but most agencies lack only one type of service. Categorization of agencies based on services that are relevant to caregivers may assist providers in describing hospice care. Purpose: To develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure older adults\\' expectations regarding aging. Design and Methods: Using focus groups, cognitive interviews, and multitrait scaling analysis, we developed a 38-item survey to measure expectations regarding aging (ERA-38). The survey consisted of 10 scales, each representing a domain of expectations. We mailed the survey to 588 English-speaking patients aged 65 years and older cared for by University of California, Los Angeles–affiliated physicians. Results: Four hundred twenty-nine participants (73%) completed the survey. The mean age was 76 years; 54% were women. Most were White (76%). All scales other than Pain demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (α ≥ .73) and item discrimination (≥.80). Sixty-eight percent of respondents stated that all or most of the ERA-38 addressed things that were important. Construct validity was supported by correlations with age, activities of daily living, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 physical and mental component scores, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Implications: Considerable support for the reliability and construct validity of the ERA-38 was obtained in this field study of 429 older adults. This instrument should be useful to investigators interested in measuring expectations regarding aging among older adults. Purpose: This study compared patterns of care, including hospitalization, during the last year of life for a group of residents in institutional long-term care. These subjects were either implicitly or explicitly in palliative care modes versus those who remained in active treatment or blended care. Design and Methods: The study used a retrospective chart review and both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis to examine indepth the end-of-life experiences of 41 nursing home residents who died in the nursing care unit of one large continuing care retirement community during an 18-month period. Results: Most residents die in palliative care modes, but their movement into palliation with comfort care and symptom management is often slowed by indecision or inaction on the part of key decision makers, interrupted by aggressive acute care, or delayed until the last few days of life. Implications: Transitions from active curative care to palliative care are important for residents in permanent long-term care placements. Improved end-of-life care requires more attention to these transitions and to the decisions that residents, their families, and care teams are called upon to make. Purpose: The correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) utilization among elders have not been fully investigated. This study was designed to identify such correlates in a large sample of older adults, thus generating new data relevant to consumer education, medical training, and health practice and policy. Design and Methods: A subsample from the 2000 Wave of the Health and Retirement Study (n = 1,099) aged 52 or older were surveyed regarding use of CAM (chiropractic, alternative practitioners, dietary and herbal supplements, and personal practices). Results: Of respondents over 65 years of age, 88% used CAM, with dietary supplements and chiropractic most commonly reported (65% and 46%, respectively). Users of alternate practitioners and dietary supplements reported having more out-of-pocket expenses on health than nonusers of these modalities. Age correlated positively with use of dietary supplements and personal practices and inversely with alternative practitioner use. Men reported less CAM use than women, except for chiropractic and personal practices. Blacks and Hispanics used fewer dietary supplements and less chiropractic, but they reported more personal practices than Whites. Advanced education correlated with fewer chiropractic visits and more dietary and herbal supplement and personal practices use. Higher income, functional impairment, alcohol use, and frequent physician visits correlated with more alternative practitioner use. There was no association between CAM and number of chronic diseases. Implications: The magnitude and patterns of CAM use among elders lend considerable importance to this field in public health policy making and suggest a need for further epidemiological research and ongoing awareness efforts for both patients and providers. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to expand knowledge regarding end-of-life care received in nursing homes through the use of narrative interviews with family members close to the decedents. Design and Methods: We conducted follow-up qualitative interviews with 54 respondents who had participated in an earlier national survey of 1,578 informants. Interviews were taped and transcribed and then coded by a five-member, multidisciplinary team to identify overarching themes. Results: Respondents report that the needs of dying patients are often insufficiently addressed by health care professionals. Their low expectations of nursing homes and their experiences cause many to become vigilant advocates. Respondents report that physicians are often “missing in action,” and they desire more and better trained staff. They indicate that regulations reinforce task-focused rather than person-centered care and add to patient and family burden. Although hospice services are reported to enhance end-of-life care, respondents also report late referrals and occasional misunderstandings about the role and scope of hospice. Implications: Sustained efforts on many fronts are needed to improve end-of-life care in nursing homes. Policy recommendations are suggested. Purpose: Our objective in this analysis was to determine how the duration of caregiving interacts with key care demands (i.e., severity of problem behaviors) to influence the institutionalization of individuals suffering from dementia. Methods: We utilized multiregional data from 4,761 caregivers of individuals with dementia over a 3-year period. We conducted multinomial logistic and Cox proportional hazards analyses to determine the moderating effects of duration on behavior problems when institutionalization was predicted. Baseline covariates included the context of care, primary objective stressors, primary subjective stressors, resources, and global outcomes. Results: The Duration of care × Behavior problems interaction term was not significant in the multinomial regression or Cox hazards models. However, main effects models demonstrated that more recent caregivers were more likely to institutionalize individuals with dementia than respondents in different stages of the caregiving career. Implications: The results emphasize the need to (a) broaden scientific conceptualizations to consider duration of care as integral; (b) refine targeting when interventions are administered early in the dementia caregiving process; and (c) understand patterns of attrition when caregiver adaptation is modeled over time. Purpose:\\u2002We examine the relationship between the perceived needs and assessed needs of community-dwelling seniors.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Trained research assistants administered the Naturally Occurring Retirement Community Baseline Survey to 268 community-dwelling older adults in suburban Maryland. Perceived and assessed needs were measured in the domains of health and function (memory, health, functional needs, mobility, and financial management), mental health (depression and loneliness), sensory functioning (vision), and health behaviors (nutrition and exercise).\\u2003Results:\\u2002In the areas of functional needs, mobility, financial management, loneliness, and vision, persons who scored as more needy were already utilizing significantly more services. Of persons not receiving services, participants in need of memory, physical health, functional, loneliness, and nutrition services were more likely to indicate they would use those services. Although there were significant relationships between assessed needs and perceived needs, there was also a high level of discrepancy, such that a substantial proportion of those participants screened as not needing services requested those services, and a sizable proportion of those who screened as needing services did not request them. The results also show a high prevalence of needs among older adults and yet low service use by those with needs for these services.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Both assessed and perceived needs should be examined in future need assessment surveys. Further investigations into the nature of discrepancies will likely result in improvement in the methodologies of screening assessed and perceived needs. Services targeted to older adults must be made more available to those dwelling in the community. Purpose:\\u2002We compared inpatient days, nursing home days, and total Medicaid claims for five Medicaid-funded home- and community-based services (HCBS) programs for in-home and assisted living services in Florida.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We studied a single cohort of Medicaid enrollees in Florida aged 60 and older, who were enrolled for the first time in any of five Medicaid HCBS programs and who had at least one assessment (N = 6,014). In this 3-year longitudinal study, we used a two-stage probit regression and ordinary least squares regression in order to test the independent effects of explanatory variables on outcomes and cost.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After controlling for differences in frailty, chronic health conditions, presence of dementia, and available caregiver, we found that Medicaid HCBS programs had a differential effect on hospital and nursing home utilization and cost.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Medicaid HCBS programs serve very impaired populations at a wide range of costs to Medicaid. The rates for Medicaid HCBS programs could be adjusted upward or downward in order to better reflect the level of need in each program. At the same time, providers could use titration techniques based on the relative costs of these needs in order to budget for the costs of meeting the needs of particular elders. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined the short- and long-term effects of Adult Day Services Plus (ADS Plus), a low-cost care management intervention designed to enhance family caregiver well-being, increase service utilization, and decrease nursing home placement of impaired older adults enrolled in adult day care. Design and Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design, to recruit 129 caregivers from three adult day centers. Two centers offered adult day services and ADS Plus (n = 67); the third center (n = 62) offered only routine adult day services. ADS Plus involved a staff social worker who provided care management and support to family caregivers through face-to-face and telephone contact. Education, counseling, and referral services were offered for 12 months.Results:\\u2002At 3-month follow-up, ADS Plus participants (n = 106) reported less depression (p =.016), improved confidence managing behaviors (p =.013) and enhanced well-being (p =.001) compared with controls. Long-term effects analyses (n = 69) showed that, compared with controls, ADS Plus participants continued to report less depression (p =.005) and enhanced confidence managing behaviors (p =.007). Also, intervention participants used adult day services on average 37 days more than controls (p =.003) and had fewer nursing home placements (n = 8) than controls (n = 17). Implications: ADS Plus is cost efficient and is easy to implement within adult day centers. It affords important clinical and public health benefits, including enhanced caregiver well-being, greater adult day service use, and fewer nursing home placements. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between functional disability and the use of health care services in a nationally representative sample of older adults by using the Andersen behavioral model of health services utilization.\\u2003Design and Methods:The study used 12 years of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992–2004), a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults older than 50 in 1992 (N = 8,947). Nonlinear multilevel models used self-reported health care service utilization (physician visits and hospital admissions) to predict racial/ethnic differences in disability (activities of daily living and mobility limitations). The models also evaluated the roles of other predisposing (age and gender), health need (medical conditions and self-rated health), and enabling factors (health insurance, education, income, and wealth).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Blacks and Latinos utilizing physician visits and hospital admissions were associated with significantly more activity of daily living disability than Whites (p <.001). Blacks utilizing physician visits (p <.001) and hospital admissions (p <.05) and Latinos utilizing hospital admissions (p <.05) were associated with more mobility disability than Whites. Other predisposing, health need, and enabling factors did not account for these racial/ethnic differences.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Nationally, health care use for Blacks and Latinos was associated with more disabilities than for Whites after we accounted for predisposing, health need, and enabling factors. The findings suggest that improving health care quality for all Americans may supersede equal access to health care for reducing ethnic and racial disparities in functional health. Purpose:\\u2002We document the extent to which older adults accurately report their spouses\\' end-of-life treatment preferences, in the hypothetical scenarios of terminal illness with severe physical pain and terminal illness with severe cognitive impairment. We investigate the extent to which accurate reports, inaccurate reports (i.e., errors of undertreatment or overtreatment), and uncertain reports (responses of “do not know”) are associated with spouses\\' advance care planning and surrogates\\' involvement in the planning.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used data from married couples who participated in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study in 2004. These 2,750 couples were in their mid-60s and in relatively good health. We conducted multinomial logistic regressions.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Surrogates were accurate in the majority of cases, made errors in 12% to 22% of cases, and were uncertain in 11% to 16% of cases. Errors of overtreatment and undertreatment were equally prevalent. For both scenarios, discussing preferences was associated with lower odds of an uncertain surrogate response.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We suggest ways that health care practitioners could facilitate family-level conversations in order to ensure that patients\\' preferences are accurately represented in end-of-life care settings. Purpose: This article explores the association between race and religious coping on caregiving appraisals for mothers who coreside with an adult child with mental retardation. Design and Methods:71 Black and 71 White women (aged 50 or older) were matched on demographic characteristics to control for the association between race and socioeconomic status. Structural equation analysis was used to examine the relationship between race, religious coping, and caregiving appraisals. Results: Black women were more likely to use religious coping. Religious coping was associated with higher levels of caregiving satisfaction, but not with burden. Blacks experienced higher levels of caregiving satisfaction. Blacks also experienced higher levels of caregiving burden due to their poor health. Implications: The needs of Blacks should be considered when developing \"best practices\" in service provision. Culturally sensitive outreach approaches should not ignore the importance of faith and faith-based organizations in the lives of Blacks. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of interventions for family caregivers of older adults. Design and Methods: Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the effects of 78 caregiver intervention studies for six outcome variables and six types of interventions. Results: The combined interventions produced a significant improvement of 0.14 to 0.41 standard deviation units, on average, for caregiver burden, depression, subjective well-being, perceived caregiver satisfaction, ability/knowledge, and care receiver symptoms. Intervention effects were larger for increasing caregivers\\' ability/knowledge than for caregiver burden and depression. Psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic interventions showed the most consistent short-term effects on all outcome measures. Intervention effects for dementia caregivers were smaller than those for other groups. The number of sessions, the setting, care receiver age, caregiver age, gender, type of caregiver–care receiver relationship (spouse vs adult child), initial burden, and study characteristics moderated the observed effects. Implications: Caregiver interventions are effective, but some interventions have primarily domain-specific effects rather than global effects. The differences between intervention types and moderators suggest ways of optimizing interventions. Purpose:\\u2002We describe the development of a 24-hr curriculum for nonclinical direct care workers in elder care that features active-learning strategies and consumer-directed approaches.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Our curricular design was based on adult education theory and a survey of 70% of the community\\'s service providers. Training was completed by 88 participants, 90% of whom had no prior formal training in elder care. Questionnaires measured participant knowledge, attitudes, and perceived improvements in understanding, empathy, and skills. A subgroup of participants and employers provided additional feedback through focus groups.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Participants significantly improved their scores on knowledge and attitude measures. In addition, direct care workers and employers gave the training high marks and identified ways in which the course helped increase workers\\' competence, empathy toward elders, and self-esteem. Lack of time and funds for training were two major barriers to broader participation.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This active-learning curriculum represents a frugal yet effective way to train current and future direct care workers. Purpose:\\u2002The aim of this study was to demonstrate that many older adults can share in the potential benefits of using a personal digital assistant (PDA), including using the device as a memory aid for addresses and appointments, to improve medication adherence, and as a useful organizational tool and communication device. Design and Methods:\\u2002A curriculum, designed specifically for older adults, was developed that provided the necessary information and practice to use the technology. The degree to which the curriculum improved user skills was measured by testing participants on basic and advanced features of each of the standard PDA programs.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Participants were successful in using the technology and indicated satisfaction with the medication-reminder program specifically designed to accommodate the needs of older adults.\\u2003Implications: The PDA, supported with well-designed software and well-executed training, can provide unique benefits to older adults. Purpose: The prevalence and correlates of paranoid ideation were investigated. Design and Methods: On the basis of a sample of 998 independently living elderly African American persons in a cross-sectional study, the study used the Brief Symptom Inventory to measure paranoid ideation and 14 independent variables, including demographic characteristics, cognitive deficit, depression, self-reported memory functioning, emotional and instrumental support, stressful life events, limitation of daily activities, self-rated health status, and self-rated hearing and vision. Results and Implications: Paranoid ideation (symptoms of paranoia) was found in 10% of this sample. A multiple regression analysis of the data revealed that of the 14 independent variables used in this study, 6 (income, instrumental support, hearing, stressful life events, self-reported memory deficit, and depression) showed a significant relationship with paranoid ideation. Purpose: In this study an attempt is made to understand how a Medicaid-only managed long-term-care (MMLTC) plan for elders differs from the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), a fully integrated model, in terms of structure, operations, patient population, and service utilization. Design and Methods: With the use of information from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and administrative data from a MMLTC plan in New York City, enrollees were compared at the start of care and their first-year service utilization with PACE, using the PACE national data set. Results: The plans differ in the range of services covered and in the larger number of members served by the MMLTC plan. The served populations differ in their sociodemographic profiles and have levels of functional need that are high, but they also differ in their relative severity of dependency in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. During the first year of enrollment, the utilization of traditional home- and community-based services was higher in PACE than in the MMLTC plan, although MMLTC plan members received much more care in the home. Total hospital utilization was lower in PACE, but nursing home utilization was higher. Implications: MMLTC is a feasible option for serving a population whose level of impairment is similar to that of PACE. Whereas PACE\\'s reliance on adult day centers is seemingly associated with a stronger medical focus and lower hospital use, the MMLTC plan\\'s emphasis on home-based personal care seems to be linked with lower nursing home use. Purpose: More than 14 million persons are projected to be diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) by the year 2020; therefore, it is not surprising that the literature contains numerous caregiver intervention studies. What is surprising is that although minority elders represent one of the fastest growing segments of the older population, they are seldom discussed in the intervention literature. Design and Methods: A purposive sample of Hispanic caregivers participated in a 5-day, 20-hr psychoeducational program to increase the caregivers\\' understanding and acceptance of AD, repertoire of coping skills, knowledge of resources, and expression of concerns and emotions of caregiving. Pre- and posttests were administered to determine if participation in the program improved caregivers\\' knowledge of the progression and management of AD, as well as knowledge of appropriate community-based services. Results: Caregivers demonstrated a significant improvement on the Caregiver Knowledge Survey, an increased awareness of community-based services, increased willingness to attend support groups, and overall satisfaction with the program. Implications: Culturally sensitive intervention research with minority AD caregivers provides the opportunity to increase understanding and improve coping skills. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was (a) to obtain information about the perceptions held by seniors and health care providers concerning what constitutes a fall and potential reasons for falling, and (b) to compare these perceptions to the research literature. Design and Methods: As part of a larger telephone survey, interviewers asked 477 community-dwelling seniors to define a fall and to provide reasons for falling. In addition, we interviewed 31 health care providers from the community on the same topics. In order to capture patterns in conceptualized thinking, we used content analysis to develop codes and categories for a fall definition and reasons for falling. We reviewed selected articles in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of fall definitions currently used in the research and prevention literature. Results: A fall had different meanings for different groups. Seniors and health care providers focused mainly on antecedents and consequences of falling, whereas researchers described the fall event itself. There were substantial differences between the reasons for falling as reported by seniors and the risk factors as identified in the research literature. Implications: If not provided with an appropriate definition, seniors can interpret the meaning of a fall in many different ways. This has the potential to reduce the validity in studies comparing fallers to nonfallers. Research reports and prevention programs should always provide an operational definition of a fall. In communication between health care providers and seniors, an appropriate definition increases the possibility for early detection of seniors in greater need of care and services. Purpose:\\u2002The study aim was to develop a measure of self-reported quality of life (QoL) for people with mild to moderate dementia based on their views—the Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We developed the measure through multiple stages. Two field tests of the measure (ns = 60 and 150) enrolled people with dementia from a memory clinic, and we used the data to analyze the psychometric properties of the scale. Nested within this was a longitudinal investigation of 36 Alzheimer\\'s disease patients prescribed with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The BASQID contains 14 items assessing a range of QoL issues. Results showed that the BASQID satisfies the criteria of a valid, reliable, and acceptable assessment of subjective QoL. Scores were responsive to changes in QoL over 3 months. Low association between the BASQID and the Mini-Mental State Examination indicates that cognitive function may influence QoL but is an indirect measure of the QoL experienced during dementia.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The BASQID provides a means of better understanding the experiences, perceptions, and beliefs of people with dementia. It does this through acknowledgement of the many influences on QoL over and above health status. Practitioners and researchers can use the BASQID alongside objective assessments of dementia to obtain a complete appraisal of a person\\'s QoL. Purpose:We describe the development of a statewide strategy to improve resident outcomes in nursing facilities, and we present some evaluative data from this strategy.Design and Methods:Key components of the strategy include (a) a partnership between the state agency responsible for the nursing home survey and certification and the school of nursing in an academic health sciences center; and (b) on-site clinical expert technical assistance and support to facilities throughout the state.Results:The partnership has resulted in state agency staff having information from analyses about resident needs and outcomes in the state and facilities having access to the quarterly electronic “Show-Me Quality Indicator Report.” On-site clinical expert technical assistance is now used widely across the state, with 569 site visits conducted in 286 different facilities to help them interpret their quality indicator (QI) reports and implement quality improvement programs; statewide improvements in QI scores have been measured in several key QIs.Implications:Other states should consider building partnerships with schools of nursing in an academic health sciences center. Programs using on-site clinical consultation can facilitate improving quality of care in nursing facilities. Purpose: This study describes the development and psychometric properties of a 24-item scale to be used in both research and practice settings that assesses the everyday care values and preferences of individuals with cognitive impairment and the perceptions of family caregivers about their relative\\'s values and preferences for care. Design and Methods: The Values and Preferences Scale was developed on the basis of previous measures used with cognitively intact samples with additional items generated by the authors in consultation with an advisory committee of practitioners, researchers, family caregivers, and persons with cognitive impairment. Individuals with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and their family caregivers (n = 111) were interviewed for the study. Results: Results of a factor analysis determined that the Values and Preferences Scale can be divided into two domains or subscales for persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers (i.e., Environment–Social Network and Personal Autonomy). These domains were found to have good internal consistency for both the individuals and their caregivers (Cronbach\\'s alphas ranged from.70 to.82). Evidence of their psychometric properties compared with measures of depression, quality of life, and involvement in decision making was also found. Implications: These findings suggest that persons with cognitive impairment are able to express values and preferences about care they currently receive or will need in the future. Further application and testing of the Values and Preferences Scale should prove useful to practitioners who assist those with cognitive impairment and their caregivers with daily care decisions and the development of care plans. Purpose:\\u2002We compared the prevalence of disability among older American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) with that among their African American and White peers, then examined sociodemographic characteristics associated with disability among AI/ANs.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We analyzed the 5% 2000 Census Public Use Microdata Sample. We assessed disability by functional limitation, mobility disability, and self-care disability for four age groups (55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and 85 years or older). \\u2003Results:\\u2002For all age strata, AI/ANs reported the highest rates of functional limitation and African Americans the highest level of mobility disability. In the 55-to-64 age group, AI/ANs experienced the highest prevalence of self-care disability, and among those aged 65 years or older, African Americans reported the highest prevalence. Compared to Whites, the adjusted odds ratios for functional limitation, mobility disability, and self-care disability were significantly elevated in AI/ANs (1.62, 1.33, and 1.56, respectively) and African Americans (1.27, 1.54, and 1.56, respectively). For AI/ANs, being of increased age, being female, having lower educational attainment and household income, not being married or in the labor force, and residing in a metropolitan area were associated with disabilities.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study contributes to researchers\\' limited knowledge regarding disability among older AI/ANs. The lack of available empirical data poses obstacles to understanding the antecedents and consequences of disability for AI/ANs. More information on the nature and extent of disabilities among AI/AN elders would enhance the ability of advocates to document their needs and raise public awareness. Likewise, policy makers could enact prevention strategies and make comprehensive rehabilitative and long-term care services available to this population. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports on the development and use of behavioral treatment as a well-being intervention for individuals with dementia residing at special care units in a nursing home.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The project took place upon the construction and opening of two new homelike units for dementia care in a rural community-care center. Twenty older adults with Alzheimer\\'s disease or related dementia diagnoses participated. One of the units was randomly selected for its residents to receive the behavioral treatment, and the other unit received usual care. A trained nursing assistant implemented the behavioral treatment three times per week for 20 to 30 min each session. The intervention lasted for 3 months. Measures taken before and after the intervention included depression and behavioral disturbance.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Compared with the usual care group, the behavioral treatment group demonstrated reduced severity in behavioral disturbance in terms of being troublesome to caregivers or dangerous to residents. Both the behavioral treatment and the usual care groups demonstrated a reduced frequency of behavioral disturbance overall. There were no differences with regard to depressive symptoms or diagnoses. The behavioral treatment was enthusiastically received by the facility staff and by the family caregivers of the participants. Purpose: Different countries have different goals for social welfare policy. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect different outcomes after certain events. This article examines changes in the economic well-being of elderly women at widowhood in the United States and Germany. Design and Methods: Longitudinal data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socioeconomic Panel were used to prepare a sample of elderly widows. Economic well-being the year before the husband\\'s death was compared with economic well-being the year after the husband\\'s death. Results: Although the prevalence of poverty is different in the two countries, most widows in both countries experienced a decline in living standards, and many actually fell into poverty at widowhood. A fall in Social Security and pension income was the largest contributor to the fall in living standards. Implications: The retirement income system in both countries seems to be adequate for married couples but appears to fail for widows. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to suggest a new approach to identifying patterns of comorbidity and multimorbidity.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A random sample of 1,039 rural community-resident American Indian elders aged 60 years and older was surveyed. Comorbidity was investigated with four standard approaches, and with cluster analysis.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Most respondents (57%) reported 3 or more of 11 chronic conditions. Cluster analysis revealed a four-cluster comorbidity structure: cardiopulmonary, sensory-motor, depression, and arthritis. When the impact of comorbidity on four health-related quality of life outcomes was tested, the use of the clusters offered more explanatory power than the other approaches. Implications:\\u2002Our study improves understanding of comorbidity within an understudied and underserved population by characterizing comorbidity in conventional and novel ways. The cluster approach has four advantages over previous approaches. In particular, cluster analysis identifies specific health problems that have to be addressed to alter American Indian elders\\' health-related quality of life. Purpose: This paper compares three interview methodologies to assess nursing home (NH) residents\\' unmet needs with regard to activity of daily living (ADL) care. Design and Methods: The study was a survey of 70 residents across seven ADL care domains. The three types of interview methods included: (a) direct satisfaction questions about ADL care, (b) questions that compared residents\\' preferences about ADL care frequency or occurrence to perceptions of the ADL care delivered (discrepancy measure), and (c) open-ended questions that asked what residents wanted changed about ADL care. Results:Estimates of the proportion of residents with unmet needs were significantly higher with the discrepancy and open-ended measures as compared to the direct satisfaction measures across most ADL care domains (McNemar\\'s Test; p < .05–p < .01). Implications: The analysis of residents\\' responses to open-ended questions produced the most useful information for individualizing aspects of technical care and assessing the interpersonal quality of care, whereas the discrepancy questions elicited specific information useful for changing the frequency or occurrence of ADL care. Interview methodologies that directly ask residents questions about satisfaction with ADL care are the least useful for designing improvement interventions. Purpose:\\u2002Dementia caregiving is a rapidly growing public health problem. Logistical problems prevent many caregivers from utilizing available interventions. This article provides a demonstration of the usefulness of technology for conducting telephone-based support groups in ethnically diverse dementia caregivers. Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants were 41 White American and Cuban American dementia caregivers participating at the Miami site of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\\'s Caregiver Health (known as REACH) program. Support groups were conducted over the telephone in English and Spanish as appropriate. Results:\\u2002Eighty-one percent of the participants found the group “valuable,” largely because of the social and emotional support and useful information obtained from other group members. The majority of caregivers also reported that their participation had increased their knowledge and skills as caregivers. Implications:\\u2002The findings demonstrate that telecommunications technology can overcome the often formidable logistical problems faced by both English- and Spanish-speaking caregivers, and it can provide benefits similar to those obtained in face-to-face support groups. Purpose:\\u2002We developed manual-guided, replicable interventions based on common needs and cultural preferences of White and African American family caregivers (CGs) of individuals with dementia, and we evaluated these interventions after a 6-month follow-up.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We randomly assigned White (n = 70) and African American (n = 48) CGs of individuals with dementia to either a skills training condition or a minimal support control condition.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The degree of treatment implementation was methodically assessed, and findings demonstrated that both interventions were delivered according to protocol and were well received by CGs. CGs in both groups reported decreasing levels of problem behaviors and appraisals of behavioral bother, and increased satisfaction with leisure activities over time. On a measure of appraisal of distress related to behavior problems, White CGs showed more improvement in the minimal support control condition, and African American CGs showed the greatest improvements in the skills training condition. Spouse and nonspouse CGs also showed differential responses to intervention.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Brief manual-guided interventions can be effective with White and African American CGs, and greater attention should be paid to possible differential responses to interventions by race and relationship to care recipient. Long-term care policies and programs in the United States suffer from a major flaw: They are balanced toward a model of nursing home care that, regardless of its technical quality, tends to be associated with a poor quality of life for consumers. This article proposes quality-of-life domains—namely, security, comfort, meaningful activity, relationships, enjoyment, dignity, autonomy, privacy, individuality, spiritual well-being, and functional competence. It argues that these kinds of quality-of-life outcomes are minimized in current quality assessment and given credence only after health and safety outcomes are considered. Five trends are reviewed that might lead to a more consumer-centered emphasis on quality of life: the disability rights movement, the emphasis on consumer direction, the growth of assisted living, increasing attention to physical environments, and efforts to bring about culture change in nursing homes. Building on these trends, the article concludes with strategies to move beyond current stalemates and polarized arguments toward forms of long-term care that are more compatible with a good quality of life. Purpose: The Minimum Data Set (MDS) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) bed-mobility item, which rates the staff-assistance level necessary for bed movement, is used to target scheduled repositioning interventions and to identify physical function changes in nursing home residents; however, accuracy of the item is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the MDS ADL bed-mobility item as completed by nursing home nurses with independent performance assessments conducted by research staff. Design and Methods: A convenience sample of 197 long-stay residents from 26 California nursing homes participating in a larger project was used in this cross-sectional study to compare independent research-staff performance assessments (using graduated assistance protocols of residents\\' ability to move in bed) and nursing home nurse MDS bed-mobility ratings. Participants also wore movement monitors to verify performance assessments. Results: Poor agreement existed between the nursing home nurse MDS bed-mobility ratings and the research-staff performance assessments across all assistance levels (kappa range, κ = 0.007, p =.918 to κ = 0.484, p <.001), with better agreement seen in totally dependent participants and with fewer elapsed days between MDS ratings and performance assessments. The odds of nursing home nurse errors (underestimating or overestimating dependency) on the MDS bed-mobility item were 2.1 times higher for participants judged independent by research staff compared with participants judged as requiring physical assistance by research staff (95% confidence interval, 1.14–4.03) when adjusted for number of days between nurse MDS ratings and research-staff performance assessments. Implications: Nursing home nurses overestimated resident dependency in bed mobility. The systematic inaccuracies in MDS bed-mobility ratings have implications for their use as a basis for targeting residents for repositioning programs and determining changes in residents\\' physical function. Performance assessments utilizing graduated assistance protocols are recommended as a method of improving the accuracy of MDS bed-mobility ratings. Purpose:\\u2002We describe and evaluate a project designed to pilot test an evidence-based clinical intervention for assessing and treating depression in older adults in rural primary care clinics. Project ADAPT—Assuring Depression Assessment and Proactive Treatment—utilized existing primary care resources to overcome barriers to sustainability experienced by similar projects.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This multifaceted intervention, which was structured after the successful IMPACT (Improving Mood/Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment) research intervention, used on-site geriatric depression specialists, clinic staff training, team collaboration, and depression practice guidelines to improve depression care for rural elders. IMPACT screening and assessment instruments and treatment protocols were modified for use by less highly trained staff already employed by the rural primary care clinics. Patient and provider depression educational materials and depression screening and monitoring protocols were provided by means of regional training sessions and phone contact. Evaluation data were collected by mail and phone surveys.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Although Project ADAPT materials and training were initially developed for providers in rural primary care clinics, most participants came from long-term-care facilities, hospitals, home care, and public health and social service agencies. Forty-four sites sent 56 staff to Project ADAPT regional trainings, but many did not participate after the initial training. Participants who did continue reported that training improved geriatric depression screening and communication with the primary provider.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Outcomes suggest that provider, patient, and system issues have to be addressed differently in rural areas to improve geriatric depression treatment in primary care settings. Purpose: We determined the prognostic value of self-reported and performance-based measurement of function, including functional transitions and combining different measurement approaches, on utilization. Design and Methods: Our cohort study used the 6th, 7th, and 10th waves of three sites of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, linked to 1- and 4-year Medicare Part A hospital costs. We examined mean hospital expenditures based on (a) 1- and 4-year transitions in self-reported functional status; (b) 4-year transitions in performance-based functional status; (c) combined baseline self-reported and performance-based functional status; and (d) poorest self-reported and performance-based functional status during a 4-year period. Results: Even modest declines in self-reported or performance-based functional status were associated with increased expenditures. When baseline self-reported and performance-based assessments were combined, mean 1- and 4-year adjusted costs were higher with progressively worse performance-based scores, even among those who were independent in self-reported function. When the poorest 4-year self-reported and performance-based functions were examined, self-reported functioning was the most important determinant of hospital costs, but within each self-reported functional level, poorer performance-based function was associated with progressively higher costs. Implications: The costs associated with even modest functional decline are high. Combining self-reported and performance-based measurements can provide more precise estimates of future hospital costs. Purpose:\\u2002We present the concept of the Green House, articulated by William Thomas as a radically changed, “deinstitutionalized” nursing home well before its first implementation, and we describe and discuss implications from the first Green Houses in Tupelo, Mississippi.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Green Houses are small, self-contained houses for 10 or fewer elders, each with private rooms and full bathrooms and sharing family-style communal space, including hearth, dining area, and full kitchen. Line staff at the level of certified nursing assistants, called Shahbazim, are “universal workers,” who cook meals, do laundry, provide personal care, assist with habilitation, and promote the elders\\' quality of life. Nurses, doctors, and other professionals comprise a visiting clinical support team for the residents and Shahbazim. Multiple Green Houses comprise a nursing home, meeting all nursing facility regulations and working within state-reimbursement levels. In 2003, four Green Houses were built on the campus of a retirement community; in June of that year, 40 residents relocated from the 140-bed nursing home to the Green Houses, including 20 residents previously living in the locked dementia unit.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Experiences to date are positive for residents, family, and staff. The sponsor is converting the entire facility to Green Houses, and other providers around the country plan to implement Green House variants.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Because nursing home stock is aging, many physical plants are or soon will be slated for major rebuilding, thereby providing sponsors with an opportunity to consider Green Houses. Early experience suggests that Green Houses are feasible and that outcomes are likely to be positive, and it also suggests that there are some potential issues to overcome in such a dramatic reengineering of nursing homes. Purpose:\\u2002According to the reserve perspective on cognitive aging, individuals are born with or can develop resources that help them resist normal and disease-related cognitive changes that occur in aging. The reserve perspective is becoming more sophisticated, but gaps in knowledge persist. In the present research, we considered three understudied questions about reserve: Is reserve primarily static (unchangeable) throughout the life course or dynamic (changeable, in terms of increases or decreases)? Can reserve be increased at any point in life, or are there optimal time periods—such as early life, midlife, or late life—to increase it? Does participation in different types of leisure and occupational activities in early life and midlife have different effects depending on specific domains of late-life cognitive functioning? Here we link early cognitive and activity data—gathered from archival sources—with cognitive data from older adults to examine these issues.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002349 participants, all mid-1940s graduates of the same high school, underwent telephone cognitive screening. All participants provided access to adolescent IQ scores; we determined activity levels from yearbooks. We used path analysis to evaluate the complex relationships between early life, midlife, and late-life variables.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Adolescent IQ had strong direct effects on global cognitive functioning, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed. Participants\\' high school mental activities had direct effects on verbal fluency, but physical and social activities did not predict any cognitive measure. Education had direct effects on global cognitive functioning, episodic memory, and, most strongly, processing speed, but other midlife factors (notably, occupational demands) were not significant predictors of late-life cognition. There were weak indirect effects of adolescent IQ on global cognitive functioning, episodic memory, and processing speed, working through high school mental activities and education. Verbal fluency, in contrast, was affected by adolescent IQ through links with high school mental activities, but not education.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Our study suggests that reserve is dynamic, but it is most amenable to change in early life. We conclude that an active, engaged lifestyle, emphasizing mental activity and educational pursuits in early life, can have a positive impact on cognitive functioning in late life. Purpose:\\u2002Although driving by persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an important public health concern, we know little about the attitudes and perceptions of key stakeholders regarding driving safety in these individuals or the factors that precipitate and influence driving assessment and cessation decisions. Design and Methods: We convened 10 focus groups composed of persons intimately involved in driving decisions for older adults to identify and compare beliefs and perceptions concerning AD and driving and to identify effective strategies to limit or cease unsafe driving. The 68 focus-group participants included health professionals, transportation and law-enforcement professionals, current and former drivers with AD, and family caregivers of current and former drivers with the disease. Results: With few exceptions, participants said that a diagnosis of very mild AD alone did not preclude driving. Most regarded family members as pivotal in monitoring and managing unsafe driving and recognized their need for institutional and medical support, especially support from physicians in counseling and evaluation of health-related fitness of older drivers. Members of each group acknowledged their own roles and responsibilities in driving decisions and described difficulties they experienced in making assessments and implementing decisions to limit or stop the driving of given individuals with AD. Implications: Education of families, professionals, and transportation specialists is needed to understand the influence of AD severity on driving abilities, identify problem driving behaviors, make appropriate referrals of unsafe drivers, and access available resources for drivers with AD and those most responsible for their safety. Purpose:\\u2002Researchers know little about the physical performance ability of residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) residents and its relationship to adverse outcomes such as fracture, nursing home placement, functional decline, and death. The purposes of this article are to (a) describe the functional characteristics of RC/AL residents, (b) examine the relationships between resident- and facility-level characteristics and physical performance, and (c) determine the predictive value of physical performance for adverse outcomes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data came from 1,791 residents in 189 RC/AL facilities participating in the Collaborative Studies of Long-Term Care. At baseline, residents were tested on four performance measures (grip strength, chair rise, balance, and walking speed), and other resident- and facility-level information was collected. Adverse outcomes were measured over 1 year. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Average grip strength was 14 ± 7 kg, 61% of residents walked <0.6 m/s (M = 0.41 m/s), 26% could perform five chair rises, and only 19% could perform a tandem stand for a least 1 s. Multivariable analyses showed that more cognitive and functional impairment, depressive symptoms and comorbid conditions, and for-profit ownership were associated with poorer physical performance. Controlling for individual characteristics, we found that better performance on the four physical performance measures was associated with a reduced risk of nursing home placement, fracture, and decline in function over 1 year.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Simple performance measures identify modifiable functional deficits and suggest targeted interventions to prolong independent mobility and aging in place in RC/AL facilities. Purpose: This study investigated whether cognitively impaired nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to harmful effects during single-person, intrabuilding room transfers. Design and Methods: A variation of a pretest–posttest experimental-comparison group design was used. Data on cognitive status, mortality, and seven morbidity outcome measures were abstracted from the Minimum Data Set Plus and were analyzed by means of event history analyses, controlling for covariates as well as baseline status of outcome variables. Results: None of the Relocation × Cognitive Status interaction effects were significant at the Bonferroni corrected p value. Implications:These findings suggest that cognitive status may not moderate the health effects of single-person room transfers. Purpose:\\u2002This study examined the potential role that publicly disseminated quality report cards can play in improving quality of care in nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We review the literature and the experience gained over the last two decades with report cards for hospitals, physicians, and health plans, and consider the issues that are of particular importance in the context of nursing home care. Results:\\u2002Experience with report cards in other areas of the health care system suggests that nursing home quality reports may have a role to play in informing consumers\\' choices and providing incentives for quality improvement. Their impact may, however, not be large. Methodological issues that may limit the accuracy of quality indicators and issues related to the design and comprehension of the information by consumers are discussed.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Quality report cards should be viewed as one of several options to ensure higher quality nursing home care. Purpose: We examined the effects of communication skills training and the use of memory books by certified nursing assistants (CNAs) on verbal interactions between CNAs (n = 64) and nursing home residents (n = 67) during care routines. Design and Methods: CNAs were taught to use communication skills and memory books during their interactions with residents with moderate cognitive impairments and intact communication abilities. A staff motivational system was used to encourage performance and maintenance of these skills. Formal measures of treatment implementation were included. Results:Results were compared with those for participants on no-treatment control units. Trained CNAs talked more, used positive statements more frequently, and tended to increase the number of specific instructions given to residents. Changes in staff behavior did not result in an increase in total time giving care to residents. Maintenance of CNA behavior change was found 2 months after research staff exited the facility. Although an increase was found in positive verbal interactions between CNAs and residents on intervention units, other changes in resident communication were absent. Implications: Nursing staff can be trained to improve and maintain communication skills during care without increasing the amount of time delivering care. The methodological advantages of including measures to assess treatment implementation are discussed. Purpose: We sought to assess the quality of care provided by an innovative Medicare+Choice HMO targeted specifically at nursing home residents and employing nurse practitioners to provide additional primary care over and above that provided by physicians. The underlying premise of the Evercare approach is that the additional primary care will reduce the rate of untoward events and reduce the use of hospitals. Four aspects of quality were assessed: mortality, preventable hospitalizations, quality indicators derived from the Minimum Data Set, and change in functioning. Design and Methods: The care provided by Evercare was compared with that for two control groups: (a) other residents in the same homes not enrolled in Evercare and (b) residents in homes in the same geographic area that did not participate in Evercare. Data came from various sources, including the Minimum Data Set. Utilization was based on Medicare data for controls and United Healthcare data for Evercare residents. Survival analysis was used to estimate mortality rates. Various risk adjustment methods were applied to the quality indicators. Results: The hazard rates of mortality were significantly lower for Evercare residents than for other residents in the same nursing homes. Evercare residents had fewer preventable hospitalizations; the difference was significant for one control group. The rates of quality indicators and functional change were equivalent. Implications: Evercare, with its use of nurse practitioners, represents a model that can provide more efficient care that is of at least comparable quality. Purpose: This study measures the differential effects of home care client characteristics typically included in standardized needs assessment protocols, and client characteristics such as attitude or demeanor that arise from the case manager–client interpersonal dynamic during the assessment process, on care plan decisions. Design and Methods: Three hundred fifty-five case managers in Massachusetts\\' state-funded home care program for elderly persons selected care plan eligibility levels for 2,054 vignette clients generated in accordance with a previously devised factorial vignette survey methodology. Robust regression models estimated the effects of standardized and nonstandardized elderly client characteristics on care plan eligibility level. Results: Client characteristics of physical functioning, psychological functioning, and resources best predicted care plan generosity, in accordance with home care program policy to match services with standardized cues of client need. Nonstandardized client characteristics, however, also significantly predicted care plan generosity. Clients who denied needing home care services were allocated less generous care plans than clients who were passive and appreciative service recipients. This finding persisted when controlling for client disability level and cognitive status. Social work licensure increased this effect. Implications:Results indicate the importance of considering how both standardized and nonstandardized cues of client need affect home care policy implementation. Findings suggest that, although case managers recognize the importance of integrating client care preferences into care planning, additional training is needed to support complex considerations of client autonomy. Purpose: This study examines depressive symptoms among adult children of elderly parents; it views the parents\\' care needs and child\\'s care activities as two separate stressors, different combinations of which may affect both caregiving and noncaregiving family members.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A sample of 4,380 women and 3,965 men from the first wave of the Health and Retirement Study was analyzed by use of four alternative forms of multiple regression analysis. Using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, respondents reported on their depressive symptoms, as well as on parental disability and care provided by themselves, their spouses, and siblings.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Noncaregivers reporting severe parental disability were significantly more likely to experience depression symptoms. Evidence of increased manifestations of depression was not found among those caring for severely disabled relatives; nor was it found among those providing care in the absence of severe parental care needs. Having a caregiving sibling was associated with increased CES-D scores among noncaregivers.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002In the current literature, personal care needs of a close relative are named among significant disturbances in the lives of caregivers. By extending this approach to members of a family network regardless of caregiver status, this study allows us to distinguish the magnitude of negative outcomes of serious parental care needs while clarifying the impact uniquely attributable to caregiving activities. Purpose:To link changes over 5 years in the health, vital and residential status of very elderly people to changes in their family caregivers\\' health. Design and Methods:Canadian population-based, longitudinal study including community and institutional residents. From interviews and clinical examinations, 948 people (mean age = 86 years) were classified as demented, frail, or healthy at two points in time. Caregivers reported on the care they provided and their health outcomes. Results:Diagnostic and residential groups of care recipients differed significantly in their level of activity of daily living/instrumental activity of daily living disability (range = 0.2 problems for the healthy group, 10–12 in the dementia groups) and in the amount of assistance received; caregiver burden scores were higher for people with dementia in the community than for those in institutions (p < .001). However, these differences did not translate directly into contrasts in caregiver health. Caregivers of healthy elders reported fewer health problems than did caregivers for people with dementia or frailty, but the latter groups did not differ significantly. Death of the care recipient and admission to institutional care did not have a consistent impact on caregiver health. Implications: The relationship between caregiver load and health outcomes is complex and dynamic; treatments that slow the progression of dementia will not necessarily relieve caregiver strain. Purpose: Negotiating transitions and residential relocation are especially difficult for residents with dementia and their families. This article examined the decision-making process regarding retention or transfer of persons with dementia in assisted living facilities. Design and Methods: Using an ethnographic approach, this study observed residents and facility life, and interviewed residents, staff, and family members in three assisted living facilities. Results: Facility managers and administrators are pivotal figures in determining the timing of transitions and transitional care. Operating within the context of care requirements of dementia, they, the facility culture, and the family members\\' involvement in resident care mediate interpretations of and responses to change and decline, and ultimately influence decision making regarding retention or transfer. Implications: Transfer or retention may occur differently depending on whether managers are on- or off-site, the assisted living culture is dementia-friendly, and families are involved in care. Sensitizing assisted living managers and educating potential residents and family members to the importance of these factors may affect the eventual likelihood and timing of discharge. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this article is to discuss and describe various measures of quality, quality indicators, and uses of information on quality with specific reference to the role or purpose of assisted living.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We reviewed a variety of major studies of assisted living quality. We elaborated models of assisted living based on differing goals or claims made for it by providers and policy makers. We then searched for available quality measures that might indicate whether assisted living was meeting those goals or living up to those claims. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Any meaningful concept of “quality” must embrace a variety of dimensions, including quality of care, quality of life, the physical environment, and resident rights. The ability to use a multidimensional concept of quality is complicated by the lack of consensus, confusion, and disagreement among consumers, providers, and regulators about the role of assisted living. This disagreement significantly confounds the task of comparing quality among assisted living settings and between assisted living and other types of long-term care.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002We propose ways that researchers may compare quality along dimensions claimed to be intrinsic to assisted living as part of an effort to inform consumer information systems, quality monitoring and assurance systems, and policy-relevant research. Such comparisons would vary, depending on the intended use of the indicators and role defined for assisted living. However, all uses contain structural, process, and outcome quality indicators, including direct feedback from interviews with residents that go beyond satisfaction measures. Purpose: The goal of this study was to develop a method of identifying incontinent nursing home (NH) residents capable of providing accurate interview information about daily NH care. Design and Methods: In 177 incontinent NH residents from four facilities, selected Minimum Data Set (MDS) ratings were compared with two standardized, performance-based, cognitive screening instruments to predict which residents could accurately answer questions concerning receipt of daily incontinence and mobility care practices. Results: MDS ratings of activity of daily living performance and cognition significantly predicted residents\\' ability to accurately describe daily care practices. Performance-based measures of cognitive functioning did not outperform the MDS ratings. Selecting residents who scored two or more on four orientation items composing the MDS Recall subscale identified residents capable of accurately describing daily care practices with a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 75%. Implications: The MDS-based criteria identified are a promising, objective method for selecting incontinent NH residents for interview to verify the occurrence of specific daily care practices. Purpose: A factor common to the results of many satisfaction surveys of elders is a lack of response variability. Increasing response variability may be useful if satisfaction surveys of elders are to be productively used in the future. In this paper, we first examine elders\\' preferences between five response formats and then examine the response variability of these five commonly used formats. Design and Methods: Satisfaction, demographic, and Short-Form 36 Health Survey data were self-reported by patients in four outpatient surgery centers during 1998 and 1999. We used six different survey instruments randomly given to 3,122 elders. Five instruments varied in response format (5-item Likert format, 5-item satisfaction format, 5-item valuation format, 4-item Chernoff faces, and 10-item visual analogue format). The sixth survey used all five different response sets, and then it asked for the respondents\\' preferences among the different response sets. Results: A total of 2,450 questionnaires were examined (response rate of 78.5%). The response format using four Chernoff faces was liked the least, with only 5% of the respondents preferring this format. The 10-item visual analogue format (10VAF) was liked the most, with 39% of the respondents preferring this format. In addition, 10% more elders thought this format was easier to use than the second-place choice (i.e., 32% vs. 22%). The coefficient of variation for the 10VAF was also higher than those in identical domains using the other response formats. This would seem to indicate that the 10VAF is less prone to a ceiling effect than the other response formats. Implications: Our results show that elders have a preference for some response formats, and from the choices we gave them a 10VAF was preferred. The 10VAF also had more response variability then the other formats we tested. Purpose:\\u2002Weak empirical evidence exists showing that nursing home staffing levels influence quality of care. We propose that weak findings have resulted in many prior analyses because research models have underspecified the labor composition needed to influence care processes that, in turn, influence quality of care. In this analysis, we specified the nursing home labor composition by using staff stability, use of agency staff, and professional staff mix, in addition to staffing levels.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data used in this investigation came from surveys of nursing home administrators (N = 6,005); Nursing Home Compare; the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting data; and the Area Resource File. Staffing characteristics, quality indicators, facility, and market information from these data sources were all measured in 2004.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The regression analyses showed that staffing levels alone were weakly associated with the six quality measures examined. However, when the regression models were more fully specified (by including agency staff, stability, and professional staff mix), staffing levels were generally associated with the quality measures (i.e., 15 of the 18 staffing coefficients were significant).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Simply adding more staff may be a necessary but not sufficient means of improving nursing home quality. Some accounting for agency staff, stability, and professional staff mix is also needed. Purpose: To compare enrollees in the Wisconsin Partnership Program (WPP), a Program for All-inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) variant designed to allow clients to use their regular primary care physician, with PACE enrollees in two programs operated by the two Wisconsin agencies. Design and Methods: All enrollees in both programs were included in the sample. Enrollees were interviewed in person. Family members were interviewed by telephone. Questions compared disability levels and satisfaction. Results:The WPP clients were generally less disabled than the PACE enrollees. The levels of satisfaction among both clients and family members were essentially comparable. The use of advance directives was higher than in the general population but did not differ across the programs. Implications:WPP may be a valuable alternative to the rigid PACE approach, which may make enrollment difficult. However, a problem may lie in the limited participation of physicians. On average, the primary care physicians had only about six clients each. This level of involvement is insufficient to motivate them to change their practice patterns to accommodate this more comprehensive and integrated approach of care of frail older persons. Purpose:\\u2002This study examines the relationship between resident satisfaction and staff perceptions of the work environment in assisted living. Staff perceptions were assessed at the facility level, using aggregate measures of staff job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and views of organizational culture. Design and Methods: The sample included 335 residents and 298 staff members in 43 assisted living facilities. Data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires. Two-level hierarchical linear models were used to test the hypotheses. With resident age, gender, and education controlled for, the relationships between resident satisfaction (Level 1 variable) and staff perceptions of the work environment (Level 2 variables) were assessed. Results: Greater resident satisfaction in the facility was associated with higher staff job satisfaction and more positive staff views of organizational culture (e.g., greater teamwork and participation in the decision making). From resident characteristics, only education was significantly related to satisfaction. More educated residents were less satisfied with assisted living. Implications: These findings suggest that a good quality of work environment for the staff contributes to a better quality of care for the residents. More research is needed to examine the causal nature of this relationship. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of specific nursing home features and state Medicaid policies on the risk of hospitalization among cognitively impaired nursing home residents.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used multilevel logistic regression to estimate the odds of hospitalization among long-stay (>90 days) nursing home residents against the odds of remaining in the nursing home over a 5-month period, controlling for covariates at the resident, nursing home, and county level. We stratified analyses by resident diagnosis of dementia.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of 359,474 cognitively impaired residents, 49% had a diagnosis of dementia. Of those, 16% were hospitalized. The probability of hospitalization was negatively associated with the presence of a dementia special care unit (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–0.94) and with a high prevalence of dementia in the nursing home (AOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.88–1.03). Higher Medicaid payment rates were associated with reduced likelihood of hospitalization (AOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90–1.00), whereas any bed-hold policy substantially increased that likelihood (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.12–1.86). We observed similar results for residents without a dementia diagnosis.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Directed management of chronic conditions, as indicated by facilities\\' investment in special care units, reduces the risk of hospitalization, but the effect of bed-hold policies illustrates how fragmentation in the financing system impedes these efforts. Purpose: Limited information is available on the effects of caregiving experiences on the adult development of caregivers under 21 years old in the United States. The current study provided an examination of the effects of youthful caregiving on the mental health of these persons when adults. Design and Methods: Twelve individuals, 23 to 58 years old, were given brief phone interviews with semistructured questions, and then they completed questionnaires on their early caregiving experiences and current mental health. To be included, respondents must have provided primary caregiving assistance (i.e., bathing, dressing, feeding, etc.) for at least one parent when the caregiver was under 21 years old. Results: The findings showed that individuals were young caregivers for parents with a number of problems, ranging from dementia to drug abuse. Individuals reported more positive mental health than negative mental health, and only two individuals had scores indicative of clinical depressive symptoms. Implications: It appears that early caregiving experiences may not result in universally negative consequences in the adulthood of young caregivers. Purpose: New York City\\'s Medicaid Home Care Services Program provides an integrated program of housekeeping and personal assistance care along with regular nursing assessments. We sought to determine if this program of supportive care offers a survival benefit to older adults. Design and Methods: Administrative data from New York City\\'s Medicaid Home Care Services Program were merged with epidemiologic and diagnostic data collected in a community study of older adults living in northern Manhattan. Of 866 older adults with Medicaid coverage living in the community, 288 (33.3%) received Medicaid home care services in the period from 1994 to 1996. Mortality was tracked through the end of 1999. Results: In proportional hazards models that adjusted for differences in sociodemographic, medical, and functional status, use of Medicaid home care service was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death in people with disability in activities of daily living. Implications: Because the program has distinctive features (greater number of weekly hours than other programs, integration with nursing assessments), it is a special case of community-based long-term care. Still, results from this observational cohort suggest that mortality risk in the most vulnerable elderly population can be reduced through a program of supportive care. Purpose: This study examined the association between cognitive functioning and completion of a durable power of attorney for health care. Design and Methods: Participants were from the Second Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA II), a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling persons who were at least 70 years of age at the time of participation. The sample included 325 older adult respondents (144 men, 181 women) with a mean age of 80.7 years (SE = 0.36) and a mean educational attainment of 11.6 years (SE = 0.18). Researchers measured each respondent\\'s cognitive functioning during follow-up by using an adapted Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, and a proxy informant indicated whether the respondent completed a durable power of attorney for health care. \\u2003Results:\\u2002A durable power of attorney for health care was completed by 60.8% (SE = 2.51) of respondents prior to their death. Logistic regression demonstrated that respondents with the first quartile of global cognitive functioning were 76% less likely to have completed a durable power of attorney (adjusted odds ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval = 0.09–0.60) than those with the fourth quartile of cognitive functioning. Implications: The factors associated with completion of durable power of attorney for health care by older adults with lower levels of cognitive functioning should be investigated further. Such data could be used to inform interventions to increase the completion rates of durable power of attorney for health care among this particular group of older adults. Purpose:\\u2002Given the exponential increase in dementia prevalence anticipated in the coming years, measurement of caregiver burden has become common in gerontological research and clinical practice. The Zarit Burden Interview (BI) has emerged as the most widely utilized burden measure. The current study examines the psychometric properties of responses to an abridged, 12-item version of this scale.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data were derived from a national epidemiological study of dementia incidence and patterns of care (N = 1,095). Informal caregivers of surviving institutionalized and community-dwelling index subjects were interviewed 5 years subsequent to initial recruitment (n = 770).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results of both the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support a two-factor structure of responses to this abridged scale. Subsequent to control for demographic variables, dementia illness features, and baseline depressive symptoms at baseline, responses to this brief BI provide a significant increase to prediction of depressive symptoms at Time 2 (R2 =.24, p <.01) with no additional variance provided by the 10 remaining items from the complete BI (ΔR2 = 0, ns). Implications:\\u2002The results of this study are discussed relative to theory and the operational definition of caregiver burden. Findings can be generalized with greater confidence given the representative and national composition of caregivers recruited for this study. Purpose: This study examined whether parents\\' retirement influences their contacts (visits, telephone/letter) with adult children outside the household. Design and Methods: The study relied on data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The sample consisted of parent–adult child dyads where parents were aged 55–75 at time 2 and adult children resided outside the household at both waves (N = 2,153 parent–adult child dyads, based on reports from 792 parents). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard errors were used. Results: Retirement has no significant effect on telephone contacts. Retired parents maintain frequent visits with children. For children living within 10 miles, mothers\\' retirement is associated with fewer and fathers\\' retirement with more visits. This trend varies by number of children, length of retirement, and child\\'s gender. For children living more than 10 miles away, retired mothers decrease visits with childless children, whereas retired fathers increase visits with childless children. Implications:We attribute these findings to the gender-specific salience of child contacts for retirees and suggest that future research address children\\'s and parents\\' expectations for postretirement contacts. Purpose: The number of women aged 45 years and older infected with the HIV virus continues to increase. This study sought to identify, from the voices of midlife and older women living with HIV, the factors in their lives that put them at risk for HIV, so as to improve HIV-prevention efforts for women of this age group. Design and Methods: In this qualitative study, we conducted in-depth interviews with 24 HIV-positive women, aged 45 to 71 years, regarding their exposure to HIV. Results: From these narratives, we identified five individual factors or themes that put women at risk for HIV: drug and alcohol abuse; not knowing the HIV-risk histories of male sexual partners; mental health issues, including physical or sexual abuse and life crises; taking risks for the sake of relationships; and lack of HIV-prevention information. These individual factors and sociocultural factors related to gender, age, and race and ethnicity were organized into a model of HIV-risk factors for midlife and older women. Implications: This model identifies themes to be addressed in HIV-prevention policy, practice, and research in order to reduce the number of new cases of HIV infection among midlife and older women. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to compare a variety of resident and staff outcomes across two types of staffing patterns, permanent and rotating assignment, and work shift. Although studies have examined these staffing patterns as part of multicomponent intervention packages, few studies have examined the isolated effects of staffing pattern by using an experimental design.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A between-groups comparison design was used to compare residents and certified nursing assistants (CNAs) from four nursing homes; two self-identified as using permanent assignment (PA) staffing and two as using rotating assignment (RA) staffing. Measures yielded data on verbal interaction among residents and staff, resident disruptive behavior, and specific aspects of resident–staff behavior during care routines. Other assessments included resident personal appearance and hygiene, expressed affect, and CNAs\\' job satisfaction, burnout, absenteeism, and turnover rates. A treatment fidelity check was conducted to confirm PA and RA staffing patterns.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Staffing patterns were significantly different between self-identified PA and RA nursing homes. Residents in PA nursing homes and on morning shifts received significantly higher ratings of personal appearance and hygiene. Rates of expressed sadness and interest among residents differed by staffing patterns and shift. However, these differences do not appear to be clinically significant. Although absenteeism was higher in PA nursing homes, these CNAs reported greater job satisfaction than CNAs from RA nursing homes. As expected, evening shifts across nursing homes had significantly higher turnover rates and significantly more resident disruptive behavior.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Quality-of-care outcomes were similar among the two types of nursing homes, despite significantly different staffing patterns. Though staff permanency rates in PA nursing homes (50%) were twice that of RA nursing homes (26%), more research is needed to determine feasibility of higher rates of staff permanency (i.e., > 50%) and effects on resident and CNA outcomes. Purpose:\\u2002Nursing supervision of the routine daily care (e.g., grooming, feeding, and toileting) that is delegated to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) is critical to nursing home service delivery. The conditions under which the supervisory role is organized and operationalized at the work-unit level, taking into account workloads, registered nurse/licensed practical nurse staffing, and role expectations, are not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to describe the organizational, managerial, and nurse-level factors associated with the nurse\\'s role as supervisor of UAP in nursing homes.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002An ethnographic approach to data collection included 31 interviews, 170 hr of observation, and organizational document review at three nursing homes. Analysis included micro-coding and content analysis. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Findings revealed (a) considerable variation in organizational resources, systems, and processes to support organization and operationalization of the supervisory role; and (b) limited evidence of nurses\\' estimation of the potential benefits of training and organizational systems to support supervisory practice and the complexity of the supervisory role.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Delivery of high-quality nursing home care is a matter of national importance, and these findings offer a call to action for nursing home leaders in policy, academia, and ownership and management positions. Nurses must be equipped with competencies and skills that reflect the complex organizational environments in which they work. Additionally, nursing home administrators and managers must be equipped with the competencies and skills needed to effectively and efficiently organize and operationalize care delivery practices to support nurses\\' role enactment. Purpose: This research identified the potential for infantilization of clients in centers that offer an occasional program of combined adult and child day care. Design and Methods: The study used a comparative ethnographic approach, which analyzed observation and interview data collected from two adult day centers that offered intergenerational activities. Special attention was paid to the environment, behaviors, and clients\\' interaction patterns. Results: The adult day center cultures varied widely in age appropriateness, opportunities for autonomy, privacy regulation, choice, and adult interaction, especially as children were introduced into the setting. Infantilization occurred in the intergenerational program when the adults and children were treated as status equals, and the activities and environments were only child oriented. Older persons perceived a need for an \"escape option\" if contact with children was overstimulating or age inappropriate. Positive intergenerational experiences involved adults in a mentoring role, voluntary participation, and client-initiated contact with children. Implications: This study explores the influence of intergenerational programming in adult day centers, and bridges the gap between theory and practice with implications for other aging services. Purpose:\\u2002This study developed measures of satisfaction with assisted living from residents\\' and family members\\' perspectives. Design and Methods: We collected survey data from 204 residents and 232 family members associated with 11 assisted living facilities. We used confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit of a priori measurement models.Results:\\u2002Iterative analysis to improve measurement models resulted in a multifaceted unidimensional model of resident satisfaction and a 5-factor model of family member satisfaction. The scales are both comprehensive and parsimonious and display strong scalar properties. Implications: These scales provide tools for estimating the impact of assisted living on various relevant domains for residents and their family members. These measures should prove useful to administrators attempting to meet the needs of their clients and to potential clients of assisted living attempting to judge the appropriateness of specific assisted living facilities. Purpose: We identify resident, nursing assistant, and facility factors associated with nursing assistant quality-of-life ratings for residents with dementia in long-term care. Design and Methods: We used a cross-sectional survey of 143 nursing assistants providing care to 335 residents in 38 residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities and nursing homes in four states. We assessed resident quality of life by using the Quality of Life–Alzheimer\\'s Disease Scale (QOL-AD). Results: Scores on the quality-of-life scale were most strongly associated with resident clinical conditions, including severity of cognitive and functional impairments, depression, and behavioral symptoms of dementia. There was also an independent positive association between nursing assistants\\' ratings of resident quality of life and their own attitudes regarding dementia-person-centered care as well as training. However, the results of hierarchical linear modeling suggest that some sources of nursing assistant variability in quality-of-life ratings remain unidentified. Implications: Quality-of-life ratings by nursing assistants may be influenced by their attitudes about dementia and their confidence in addressing residents\\' fundamental care needs. Purpose:\\u2002This article presents an overview of what is known about dementia services in assisted living settings and suggests areas for future research.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We undertook a search of Medline, the Journals of Gerontology, and The Gerontologist. We then organized publications dealing with the target subject into 10 topic areas and reviewed them.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The article describes the demographic characteristics of cognitively impaired residents in assisted living and related residential settings in the United States, the services they receive, and process and structural elements both in specialized dementia units and in integrated assisted living settings. Finally, we review the literature on methodological issues regarding research in this area.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002It is important to generate research on processes as well as outcomes, such as dignity, individualized and pleasurable experiences, and freedom from pain and discomfort. We make recommendations for both content areas that would benefit from further research as well as methodological approaches that will yield important information in this field. Purpose: This study examined change in the decision-making autonomy of a single nursing facility resident. Design and Methods: This case analysis was part of a larger 3-year ethnographic investigation of decision-making events in four nursing facilities. In this case analysis, the resident, her daughter, and three staff members closely associated with the resident\\'s care were each interviewed five times over a 15-month period. Results: Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four themes in decision making. Temporal change was evident in a complex scenario regarding room changes. Spatial context reflected the need for predictability and adaptability in decisions using space. Interdependence of decisions and decision makers was most evident with medical treatment and health care decisions. Awareness, being informed, and knowing what was going on was the final theme. Implications: Despite having the best interests of the resident in mind, the process of decision making in nursing facilities may contribute to a pattern of gradual withdrawal of decisional autonomy from residents regardless of their ability to make decisions. Purpose:\\u2002The present study attempts to further validate the COPE Index on a large sample of carers drawn from six European countries.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a cross-sectional survey, with approximately 1,000 carers recruited in each of six countries by means of a common standard evaluation protocol. Our saturation recruitment of a designated quota of carers occurred by means of several channels, in identified geographical zones within countries. Interviews were carried out with primary informal carers by use of a common assessment tool. We subjected items of the COPE Index to principal component analysis and we assessed emergent components through the use of Cronbach\\'s alpha reliability procedures. We examined factor components as summative scales for confirmatory correlations with caregiving and psychological variables. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Three components emerged, which we identified as the negative impact of caregiving, the positive value of caregiving, and the quality of support for caregiving. Internal consistency was good for negative impact and satisfactory for positive value and quality of support. Negative value was most consistently and strongly correlated with caregiving and psychological variables, although we did find diverse associations between these variables and the COPE Index subscales.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The COPE Index is a brief, first-stage assessment of some sophistication that can enable health and social care professionals to develop appropriately targeted interventions to enhance the positive aspects of the caregiving experience and quality of support, as well as reduce the negative impacts of caregiving. Purpose:\\u2002We attemptto determine whether older workers and early retirees avoid managed care plans and to explore whether health plan choices are linked to the health status of workers or their spouses.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We use the responses of those born between 1931 and 1941 to the 1994 and 1998 waves of the Health and Retirement Survey. We analyze current workers and early retirees separately, using cross-tabular and multinomial logit techniques.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Among older adults with active worker coverage, 60% were enrolled in either a health maintenance organization or preferred provider organization in 1998; 42% of early retirees were enrolled in these plans. Those with a choice of plans were even more likely to be in managed care. When demographic characteristics, time, and differences in the benefits and cost of the various plans offered by an employer are controlled for, health status (measured in a variety of ways) has little bearing on an older worker\\'s choice of health plan.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings suggest that older workers choose plans much as younger workers do. Employers are likely to continue to offer managed care as their workers age. The lack of unidirectional findings on health status bodes well for the long-term practicality of managed care under Medicare. Many workers are choosing an insurance type early in their tenure and remaining with that type of plan as they age. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to develop an empirically based, psychometrically sound instrument for the assessment of grief in caregivers of persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Design and Methods: A total of 184 statements addressing personal grief reactions were obtained from 45 adult child and 42 spouse caregivers in 16 focus groups representing early, middle, late, and postdeath stages. These were presented to a second sample of 83 adult child and 83 spouse caregivers, who rated them according to their current experience. Also administered were the Beck Depression Inventory, the Anticipatory Grief Scale, the Caregiver Strain Index, the Caregiver Well-Being Scale–Basic Needs, and the Perceived Social Support–Family Questionnaire. Results: Factor analysis resulted in a 50-item scale containing three factors: Personal Sacrifice Burden, Heartfelt Sadness and Longing, and Worry and Felt Isolation. Cronbach\\'s alpha scores ranged from .90 to .96, indicating high internal consistency reliability for each factor as well as for their combined total. Correlations of each factor with other measures provide evidence of validity, especially when assessed in the context of the caregiver grief model. Implications: Results suggest that caregiver grief is neither a unitary nor a static construct and that a scale such as this may be appropriate for use in supportive, clinical, and research settings. Purpose:An increasingly important task for all disciplines involved in aging research is to identify and prioritize areas for investigation. This article reports the results of a national Delphi study on setting research priorities for gerontological social work. Design and Methods:Delphi methodology, a structured process for eliciting and correlating informed opinions from a panel of experts on a specific topic, was used. A national expert panel of 46 gerontological social workers completed three successive Web-based questionnaires with controlled feedback to delimit a set of high-priority research topics. Results:There were 49 independent research topics identified, 16 of which attained high or highest priority and high or moderate consensus ratings. The top-priority topic was developing and testing psychosocial interventions across specific populations and conditions. Three additional topics on intervention research achieved similar ratings, as did all four topics on services research.Implications:The research priorities identified by expert panelists in this study represent critical knowledge needs for the social work profession in aging, and they overlap and complement the current research agendas of the National Research Council and the National Institute on Aging. They are thus expected to help guide the development and prioritization of social work and interdisciplinary research to improve practice and policies affecting older adults and their families. Purpose: This study examines the impact of the post-acute prospective payment system (PPS) on Medicare-funded rehabilitation services in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and whether such impact varies under different payment mechanisms.Design and Methods: We interviewed 214 Medicare beneficiaries admitted to three SNFs in southern California for rehabilitation. We compared patients\\' admission characteristics and therapy utilization among those receiving post-acute rehabilitation before and after the implementation of PPS. Results: Patients admitted after PPS implementation were more likely to have orthopedic problems or stroke and poorer self-reported physical health. They had significantly shorter lengths of stay in rehabilitation and received significantly less therapy, although those in managed care had less reduction in treatment after SNF-PPS implementation than those in fee-for-service. Implications: After SNF-PPS implementation, rehabilitation treatment levels in the study sites were reduced. Whereas changes in Medicare managed care were comparatively modest, we observed significant changes in intensity and duration of physical and occupational therapies in Medicare fee-for-service. Purpose: The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of Kevorkian euthanasia cases were compared with Oregon physician-assisted suicide (PAS) cases and U.S. mortality data. Design and Methods: Two hundred variables were coded from medical examiner reports on all 69 Kevorkian euthanasia cases who died and were autopsied by the Oakland County Medical Examiner. Data on the 43 Oregon PAS cases in the first two years and U.S. mortality data were obtained from published sources. Results: Only 25% of patients euthanized by Kevorkian were terminally ill as compared to 100% of Oregon PAS cases. PAS cases were significantly more likely to have cancer (72%) than euthanasia cases (29%). Women and those who were divorced or had never married were significantly more likely to seek euthanasia than would have been predicted by national mortality statistics. Implications: Gender and marital status appeared to influence decisions to seek an assisted death, and research on the role of these factors in end-of-life decision making is merited. Purpose:\\u2002This study investigated whether higher rates of nursing home quality citations are associated with increased risk of voluntary and involuntary facility terminations from the Medicare/Medicaid certification process.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We examined nationwide Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data from 1992 through 2000 and used a multinomial logistic regression model with time-varying covariates to estimate the relationship between nursing home deficiencies and terminations. Results:\\u2002In the study period, 8.7% of nursing homes voluntarily terminated and 2.4% of facilities were involuntarily terminated. Deficiencies significantly predicted both types of termination, controlling for state and market characteristics. Low occupancy and very high Medicaid mix were strongly related to voluntary and involuntary terminations (p <.05). Implications:\\u2002Nursing homes that receive a high number of deficiencies exit the Medicare/Medicaid market and have lower occupancy rates before termination, although the relationship varies considerably across states. If competition on the basis of quality is increased because of public reporting efforts, our analyses suggest that terminations, both voluntary and involuntary, will likely increase. Purpose: The main goal of this study was to determine how well the disability questions of both the 1990 and 2000 Census correlated with a standard measure of disability. If the census questions were to correlate moderately well with a standard measure of disability, then Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and other organizations would be able to use census information in estimating service needs for their catchment (service) area. Design and Methods: Questionnaires containing both the census disability questions and a standard measure of disability were mailed to 4,508 older adults; 1,514 completed surveys were returned. In order to assess reliability, 472 of the respondents who completed the mail survey were reinterviewed by phone. All three disability measures were collapsed into the following three categories: no needs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) needs only, and activities of daily living (ADL) needs. Results: All three disability measures exhibited moderate to good test–retest reliability. Using a standard measure of disability as the criterion, validity for the 1990 Census measure was quite low (Kappas of approximately 0.35). Validity for the 2000 Census measure was moderate to good (Kappas of approximately 0.60). Implications: These results suggest that the 2000 Census disability questions may be sufficiently valid for planning purposes. However, additional research with more representative samples of older adults is needed. Purpose:\\u2002This article provides a historical overview of the emergence of assisted living in the United States over a 25-year period to identify goals and key concepts that underpinned the emerging form of care.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The method is historical analysis based on records and my own personal experiences in conceptualizing and implementing assisted living in Oregon and nationwide. \\u2003Results:I identified four time periods: (a) 1979 to 1985, when a paradigm shift occurred on both the East and West coasts, motivated by distaste for nursing facilities and idealistic values regarding residential environments, service capacity, and consumer-centered care philosophy; (b) 1986 to 1993, when providers, consumers, and state governments became interested and four identifiable types of assisted living (hybrid, hospitality, housing, and health care) appeared, each of which informed the evolution of assisted living; (c) 1994 to 2000, a period of expansion, Wall Street money, dilution of the ideals, and emerging quality concerns; a crisis of confidence and a crossroads for assisted living; (d) 2000 to the present, a time of regrouping, slow-down in growth, and reexamination of earlier efforts to define and set standards for assisted living.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Well-conceptualized and designed research may provide a mechanism to suggest practice, regulatory, and payment models. I recommend that researchers conduct studies from the values premises underlying the assisted living approach. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to estimate hospital and long-term-care costs resulting from falls in long-term-care facilities (LTCFs).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The study used a retrospective, pre/post with comparison group design. We used matching, based on propensity scores, to control for baseline differences between fallers and non-fallers. We estimated residents\\' propensity to fall from demographics, comorbidities, and reimbursement in the pre-period. The matched sample included 1,130 fallers and 1,130 non-fallers who were residents of a large, multifacility long-term-care chain. Cost estimates were based on information in the Minimum Data Set and were defined as hospital and LTCF reimbursements. We estimated fall-related costs as the difference between changes in costs for fallers and non-fallers from the pre- to post-period.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Fallers were substantially more likely to suffer fractures and hospitalizations in the post-period than were non-fallers. Fall-related LTCF and hospital costs were $6,259 (95% confidence interval = $2,034–$10,484) per resident per year. About 60% of this amount was attributable to higher hospitalization costs. Fallers were more likely to be discharged to hospitals or to die.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Falls in LTCFs are associated with costs of about $6,200 per resident per year. These results provide baseline estimates that one may use to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce fall rates. Purpose: This study explored the impact of cognition and the availability of other drivers on driving restriction and cessation among older adults. Design and Methods:Survey data from the first wave of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old data were analyzed, using multinomial logistic regressions. Results: Cognitive impairment is associated with driving restriction and cessation, although a noteworthy minority of mildly and severely cognitively impaired individuals continue to drive. Partner\\'s driving and involvement and presence of other drivers in the household moderated the effect of cognition on driving restriction and cessation. Implications:The decision processes surrounding an individual\\'s restricting or stopping driving are complex and may include consideration not only of competence, but also of sense of self-worth and relationship with a partner. Purpose: The contribution of bioethics to clinical care at the end of life (EOL) deserves critical scrutiny. We argue that researchers have rarely questioned the normative power of autonomy-based bioethics practices. Research on the ethical dimensions of EOL decision making has focused on an idealized discourse of patient \"choice\" that requires patients to embrace their dying to receive excellent palliative care. Design and Methods:Our critique is based on a comprehensive review of empirical research exploring bioethics practices at the EOL. In addition we will provide a brief review of our own ethnographic, longitudinal study of the decision-making experience of dying patients, their families, and their health care providers. Results: There is little or no empirical evidence to support the autonomy paradigm of patient \"choice\" in EOL decision making. What we found is that (a) prognostication at the EOL is problematic and resisted; (b) shared decision making is illusory, patients often resist advance care planning and hold other values more important than autonomy, and system characteristics are more determinative of EOL care than patient preferences; and (c) the incommensurability of medical and lay knowledge and values and the multifaceted and processual nature of patient and family decision making are at odds with the current EOL approach toward advance care planning. Implications: It is exceedingly difficult to identify, study, and critique normative assumptions without creating them, reproducing them, or obliterating them in the process. However, a fuller account of the morally significant domains of end-of-life care is needed. Researchers and policy makers should heed what we have learned from empirical research on EOL care to develop more sensitive and supportive programs for care of the dying. Purpose:\\u2002Recent studies have concluded that there is a lack of “patient-centered” care in nursing homes and subsequently a need for nursing home culture change. As a result, a variety of new, promising initiatives have been introduced, with most of these incorporating the use of “empowered” employees. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of empowered work teams—a work design specifically established to empower certified nurse aides (CNAs)—within the long-term-care setting.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a multimethod, pretest–post-test design to examine the effects of these teams. Our qualitative analysis included observations of over 270 team meetings. The quantitative analyses included five pairs of nursing homes, with five implementing empowered work teams and five acting as comparisons.\\u2003Results:\\u2002The quantitative as well as qualitative analyses indicate that the work teams had a variety of modest, positive effects: increased CNA empowerment; better CNA performance; improved resident care and choices; improved procedures, coordination, and cooperation between CNAs and nurses; and possibly reduced turnover. There appeared to be mixed effects on work attitudes.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002As new initiatives strive to move away from the medical model and toward a person-centered model, the data suggest that empowered CNA work teams can help. Purpose:\\u2002This article describes, and provides data on, an innovative, comprehensive, dementia-specific training program designed to teach direct care staff in assisted living residences to improve care and reduce problems in residents with dementia.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002STAR—which stands for Staff Training in Assisted living Residences—provides two 4-hr workshops augmented by four individualized on-site consultations and three leadership sessions. Developed by means of an iterative process of implementation and revision, it was then evaluated in a small randomized controlled trial. A total of 114 staff and 120 residents in 15 residences participated.\\u2003Results:\\u2002STAR was exceptionally well received. Training details are provided with a discussion of unique challenges inherent in implementation. Following training, STAR residents evidenced significantly reduced levels of affective and behavioral distress compared with control residents. Furthermore, STAR residents improved whereas control residents worsened (p <.05). Staff with STAR staff training reported less adverse impact and reaction to residents\\' problems (p <.05) and more job satisfaction (p <.10) compared with control staff.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002STAR is an effective training program for direct care staff working with dementia residents in assisted living. The importance of continued development and investigation of STAR efficacy and effectiveness is underscored by the growing numbers of residents with dementia who are receiving care in these settings. Purpose:\\u2002Previous studies investigating adverse outcomes of hospitalized elders have focused on community-dwelling patients. Given the rapid growth of populations living in other settings, such as assisted living facilities, it is important to understand whether these patients are at higher risk of experiencing specific adverse outcomes during hospitalization, so that interventions can be developed to reduce risk.\\u2003Methods:\\u2002This is a prospective, observational study of 212 sequential patients admitted during a 1-month period in 2006 to a 38-bed Acute Care for Elders unit in Rochester, New York and followed until discharge. We categorized the patients by residence prior to admission (i.e., community, assisted living, and nursing home). Our outcome categories were: worsening function, delirium, depression, falls, pressure sores, and nursing home admission.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After adjusting for multiple characteristics, we found that patients admitted from assisted living facilities were at substantially higher risk than those admitted from the community for functional decline and falls. Patients from nursing homes had a trend toward increased risk for these outcomes, but the trend did not reach statistical significance. More than three fourths of assisted living facility residents were discharged to a nursing home after hospitalization, with a relative risk of 9.41 (p <.001) versus community-dwellers for this outcome.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002People who are admitted to the hospital from assisted living facilities are at high risk for falls and functional decline during hospitalization. Assisted living residents are at a particularly high risk of nursing home admission following hospitalization. Targeted preventive programs should be developed with a goal of reducing risk in this vulnerable population. Purpose: We examine the psychometric properties of the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale (PGMS) in an elderly Chinese population in Hong Kong. Design and Methods: The study consisted of two cohorts: (a) 759 participants aged 70 years and older living in the community who were recruited as part of a territory-wide health survey and interviewed in 1993–1994; and (b) 388 participants living in long-term-care institutions in 1995–1996. Participants who were cognitively impaired (Abbreviated Mental Test score less than 7) or who could not answer questions for other reasons were excluded. The 15-item PGMS was administered. The Rasch dichotomous model was used to assess the validity of the PGMS, and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, previously validated in Chinese, was also administered to examine the concurrent validity. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis identified three underlying factors similar to findings among Caucasians; however, not all the goodness-of-fit indices were acceptable. An exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring and promax rotation revealed two underlying factors that explained 35% of the total variance: reconciled aging and unstrained affect. Some items were redundant when applied to the institutional sample. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by the good correlation between the reconciled aging and unstrained affect domains and the Geriatric Depression Scale (r = −0.72 and r = −0.56 respectively). Female gender, older age, and residence in institutions were associated with lower morale. Implications: The PGMS is a valid quality-of-life measure in elderly Hong Kong Chinese persons, but its psychometric properties are slightly different from those for Caucasians. Purpose:\\u2002Flexibility is an essential ingredient of person-centered care. We illustrate the potential impact of flexibility by portraying a nursing home that uses flexibility in its approach to residents and staff members.\\u2003Designs and Methods:\\u2002The paper describes the management strategies, principles, and environmental features used by the Adards nursing home in Australia.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Adards\\' flexibility in daily work and task scheduling promotes both resident and staff autonomy, which in turn allows for higher staffing levels, lower staff turnover, and more typical life experiences for residents than is found in many long-term-care facilities in the United States.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The article provides an example and a basis for future discussion on this topic, with the hope that it will prompt other institutions to expand the level of flexibility in their policies and procedures. Purpose:\\u2002We determine the main outcome effects of a 12-month computer-mediated automated interactive voice response (IVR) intervention designed to assist family caregivers managing persons with disruptive behaviors related to Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We conducted a randomized controlled study of 100 caregivers, 51 in the usual care control group and 49 in the technology intervention group, who received yearlong access to an IVR-mediated system. The system provided caregiver stress monitoring and counseling information, personal voice-mail linkage to AD experts, a voice-mail telephone support group, and a distraction call for care recipients. We conducted analyses by using a repeated measures approach for longitudinal data and an intention-to-treat analytic approach. Outcomes included the caregiver\\'s appraisal of the bothersome nature of caregiving, anxiety, depression, and mastery at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results:\\u2002There was a significant intervention effect as hypothesized for participants with lower mastery at baseline on all three outcomes: bother (p =.04), anxiety (p =.01), and depression (p =.007). Additionally, wives exhibited a significant intervention effect in the reduction of the bothersome nature of caregiving (p =.02).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Wives who exhibited low mastery and high anxiety benefited the most from the automated telecare intervention. Findings suggest that, to optimize outcome effects, similar interventions should be tailored to match the users\\' characteristics and preferences. Purpose: This study examines the relationship between the first set of quality measures (QMs) published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on the Nursing Home Compare Web site and five nursing home structural characteristics: ownership, chain affiliation, size, occupancy, and hospital-based versus freestanding status. Design and Methods: Using robust linear regressions, we examined the values of the QMs at first publication and their change over the first five reporting periods, in relation to facility characteristics. Results: There were significant baseline differences associated with these facility characteristics. Pain, physical restraints, and delirium exhibit a clear downward trend, with differences between the first QM reporting period and the fifth ranging from 12.7% to 46.0%. However, there were only minimal differences in trends associated with facility characteristics. This suggests that the relative position of facilities on these measures did not change much within this time period. The variation by facility type was larger for the short-stay QMs than for the long-stay measures. Implications: Those QMs that show an improvement exhibit it across all types of facilities, irrespective of initial quality levels. Although a number of alternatives may explain this positive trend, the trend itself suggests that report cards, to the extent that they are effective, are so for all facility types but only some QMs. Purpose:The authors investigate the impact of hearing loss on quality of life in a large population of older adults.Design and Methods:Data are from the 5-year follow-up Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, a population-based longitudinal study of age-related hearing impairment conducted in Beaver Dam, WI. Participants (N = 2,688) were 53–97 years old (mean = 69 years) and 42% were male. Difficulties with communication were assessed by using the Hearing Handicap for the Elderly—Screening version (HHIE-S), with additional questions regarding communication difficulties in specific situations. Health-related quality of life was assessed by using measures of activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Hearing loss measured by audiometry was categorized on the basis of the pure-tone average of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz.Results:Of participants, 28% had a mild hearing loss and 24% had a moderate to severe hearing loss. Severity of hearing loss was significantly associated with having a hearing handicap and with self-reported communication difficulties. Individuals with moderate to severe hearing loss were more likely than individuals without hearing loss to have impaired ADLs and IADLs. Severity of hearing loss was significantly associated with decreased function in both the Mental Component Summary score and the Physical Component Summary score of the SF-36 as well as with six of the eight individual domain scores.Implications:Severity of hearing loss is associated with reduced quality of life in older adults. Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify health-related changes occurring between 1983 and 1990 that characterize and differentiate 1996 long-term care outcomes (no services, home care, nursing home) among people aged 85 years and older. Design and Methods:Variables capturing health-related changes between 1983 and 1990 in a cohort (N = 616) of Aging in Manitoba Longitudinal Study participants aged 85 years and older were used in a series of logistic regression models to identify factors that best predicted the use of long-term care services in 1996, controlling for age and sex. Results: Factors predicting home care use relative to no services included changes in self-rated health, income adequacy, and railings outside of the house. Factors predicting nursing home use relative to home care included age and changes in general life satisfaction. Factors predicting nursing home use relative to no services included age; previous service use; length of time in the community; and changes in income adequacy, type of housing, and state of mind. Implications: These findings challenge assumptions about the linearity of the continuum of long-term care services, because different factors were shown to predict home care use than were shown to predict nursing home use. Purpose:\\u2002Performance measurement systems for nursing homes assume that facility performance contributes heavily to individual outcomes. This research illustrates how that assumption can be assessed using the change in residents\\' activities of daily living (ADLs).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002The data used in these analyses were all from residents with both an admission and a quarterly assessment in a sample of all admissions to a randomly chosen 10% of Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing homes operating during 2002. \\u2003Results:\\u2002Models including both facility and individual variables explained up to 20% of the variation in ADL change after admission. Facility identity in isolation explained between 8% and 14% of the variation in ADL change.\\u2002Implications:\\u2002The results suggest that quality indicators based on change in ADLs may be problematic when used in nursing home performance measurement systems. More generally, the results recommend that the level of variation in performance measures attributable to facility identity or performance become a much more central consideration when researchers evaluate quality indicators for use in nursing home performance measurement systems. Purpose:\\u2002This article examines factors within the long-term-care work environment that impact the effectiveness of continuing education.\\u2003Design & Methods:\\u2002In Study 1, focus group interviews were conducted with staff and management from urban and rural long-term-care facilities in southwestern Ontario to identify their perceptions of the workplace factors that affect transfer of learning into practice. Thirty-five people were interviewed across six focus groups. In Study 2, a Delphi technique was used to refine our list of factors. Consensus was achieved in two survey rounds involving 30 and 27 participants, respectively.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Management support was identified as the most important factor impacting the effectiveness of continuing education. Other factors included resources (staff, funding, space) and the need for ongoing expert support.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Organizational support is necessary for continuing education programs to be effective and ongoing expert support is needed to enable and reinforce learning. This study examined the complexities of age relations at work. Garment workers believed that their fate was linked to ageism and that their work experience was discounted by management. Managers wanted to be rid of older workers because they commanded higher wages than younger workers. The issue was cost reduction, and age was implicated unintendedly. Still, managers seemed to use stereotypical images to discourage older workers and they did not organize work routines to facilitate the adaptation of them. Instead, they subcontracted the easy jobs, relying on the experience of the older employees for difficult work while not adapting the workplace. Theoretically, the authors argue that ageism and age discrimination can best be understood through a recognition of the importance of structured age relations and human agency. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to describe the development and operation of a new model for integration of medical and social services. The Vulnerable Adult Specialist Team (VAST) provides Adult Protective Services (APS) and criminal justice agencies with access to medical experts who examine medical and psychological injuries of victims of elder abuse. Design and Methods: This retrospective, descriptive analysis included community-dwelling elders and adults with disabilities who were reported for mistreatment and referred to VAST (n = 269). Results: Most cases came from APS for mental status and physical examination for evidence of abuse. Cases referred to a medical response team (n = 269) were significantly different from cases that were not referred (n = 9,505). Implications: Ninety-seven percent of those who referred cases to VAST indicated that the team was helpful in confirming abuse, documenting impaired capacity, reviewing medications and medical conditions, facilitating the conservatorship process, persuading the client or family to take action, and supporting the need for law enforcement involvement. As a result, VAST has become institutionalized in our county. Amenable to replication, medical response teams for elder abuse may be useful in other counties across the nation. Purpose:\\u2002We describe the results of the dissemination of an efficacious, home-based exercise program called Strong for Life as it was implemented in a nationwide, volunteer caregiving program called Faith in Action, including training of volunteers who implemented the program, recruitment of older adult participants, exercise adherence, and attitudes and perceptions of program staff and participants.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Frail, homebound older adults (N = 105) were recruited from 10 Faith in Action sites to participate in the Strong for Life exercise program. Volunteer trainers (n = 103) were trained by physical therapists to assist the older adults with the program. Surveys were conducted with older adults, volunteer trainers, and Faith in Action sites at baseline and after the older adults had been engaged in the program for 4 months.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Satisfaction with program components was very high: At follow-up, 100% of volunteers and 98.6% of older adults rated the program positively. Participants reported engaging in exercise on average 2.2 times per week, with 53% of the participants exercising at least 2 to 4 times per week. Participants also had significant improvements in the Short Form-20 social functioning scale. There were no serious adverse events reported.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Dissemination of the Strong for Life program in a community setting using trained lay volunteers was feasible, acceptable, and safe. Existing volunteer caregiving organizations such as Faith in Action offer a feasible and safe means of disseminating late-life exercise programs to the frail older population. Purpose:\\u2002This study explored whether adult day service (ADS) use was associated with reductions in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in individuals with dementia.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We used a quasi-experimental design to compare a group of 133 persons with dementia (PWDs) who initially enrolled in an ADS program to a control group not using these services (n = 68). Caregivers used a 24-hour log on multiple, consecutive days to report on five domains of BPSD.\\u2003Results:\\u2002We used growth-mixture modeling techniques to model change in the BPSD domains over a 2-month period as well as to handle the preponderance of zeros that were inherent in the data. Results showed a relationship between ADS use and caregivers\\' report of fewer nighttime sleep-related problems for their PWDs. We found trends for other domains, specifically depressive symptoms and agitated behavior, but no significant group differences emerged for these and the other domains.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings of ADS use on PWDs\\' duration of nighttime sleep problems provide some evidence of the benefits of ADS; the findings also support its utility as part of the continuum of care for PWDs and their caregivers. For other behavior domains, enhanced or more targeted behavioral strategies coupled with ADS might offer caregivers and their PWDs the best possible combination for ameliorating BPSD. Purpose:\\u2002Opportunities for social interaction are lacking within today\\'s nursing homes and staff frequently communicate messages of dependence, incompetence, and control to residents. This study evaluated a brief educational program designed to increase staff awareness of intergenerational speech modifications such as elderspeak and strategies to enhance communication.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A communication-training program was provided to Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs; n = 20) in five nursing homes. Audio recordings of staff interacting with residents before and after training were transcribed, coded, and compared on features of elderspeak.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After the training, CNAs reduced their use of elderspeak including terms of endearment, inappropriate collective pronouns, and shortened sentence length. In addition, the emotional tone of staff speech with residents was rated as less controlling and more respectful after the training while caring qualities were maintained. Speech rate did not change significantly.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Teaching CNAs to reduce elderspeak holds promise as an approach to improving the social environment in nursing homes. Purpose:\\u2002The aim of this study was to estimate the longitudinal relationship between transitions in the use of long-term care and older adults\\' depressive symptoms and to investigate whether this relationship could be explained by markers of older adults\\' underlying health, or other variables including demographics, personality, and partner status.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Data were from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, which consists of a random, community-based sample of 3,107 older Dutch people (55–85 years of age) stratified by age and gender. The use of informal care, professional home care, and institutional care was recorded, and respondents were screened on depressive symptoms. Follow-up measurements took place at 3 and 6 years.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Longitudinal analyses showed significant associations between the enduring use of professional long-term care and an increase in depressive symptoms. Transitions to professional home care or institutional care were also associated with considerably more depressive symptoms after 3 years, whereas transitions from professional home care or institutional care to no care or informal care only were not associated with a change in depressive symptoms. Most of the associations remained significant after indicators of underlying health and other covariates were adjusted for, and also after the data were reanalyzed for respondents with and without functional limitations. Implications: This study does not involve a controlled experiment of professional long-term care among older adults. However, the findings suggest the possibility that receiving professional long-term care could introduce new stressors and increase the risk of depressive symptoms. Our analyses illuminate the concerns of elders regarding their use of professional long-term care and may help in planning for more effective delivery of this type of care. Purpose. The purpose of this work was to examine how structural factors, residents\\' needs for physical and psychosocial assistance, and the work stressors experienced by employees are related to the quality of life of elderly residents in long-term care. Design and Methods. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 1,194 employees and 1,079 relatives of residents in 107 residential-home units and health-center bed wards. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Results. The majority of differences in both employees\\' and relatives\\' perceptions of residents\\' quality of life across units could be explained by work stressors such as time pressure. Large unit size was related to both increased time pressure among employees and reduced quality of life of residents. Implications. Long-term care units are encouraged to review their practices so that employee well-being is supported. Attention also should be focused on unit size, as small units appear better able to help employees cope with work stress, resulting in better quality of life for residents. Better Jobs Better Care was the nation\\'s largest single initiative created to reduce the high vacancy and turnover rates of direct care workers and improve workforce quality through both policy and practice changes. In this article, we describe the important role and key characteristics of direct care workers, what motivated the unique partnership between a provider association and a direct care worker advocacy organization to create this initiative, and how the initiative was designed to respond to the key challenges through applied research and demonstration projects. We conclude by discussing how BJBC has influenced providers, policy makers, and direct care workers to think about these frontline caregivers, who are the crux of the long-term care workforce. Purpose: The purpose of the two studies described in this paper was to assess whether adults with dementia could assume an advice-giving role (Study 1) and a teacher role (Study 2) despite their cognitive impairments. So far, no research on adults with dementia has compared language production in a social conversation condition with that in an advice-giving condition. Moreover, there are no data on language production in cognitively intact adults and in adults with dementia in a teaching situation (e.g., a cooking task). Design and Methods: In Study 1, we used a within-groups design in order to compare language production in advice-giving and social conversation conditions. In Study 2, we used a between-groups design in order to compare language production in older adults with and without dementia. Measures in Study 1 were the occurrence of imperatives, discourse-building components, and discourse deficits. Measures in Study 2 yielded information on teacher-role implementation, cooking-related discourse, general discourse, discourse deficits, and experimenter-related discourse. Results: We found role-consistent discourse components in Study 1 as indicated by the number of imperatives in the advice-giving condition. Additionally, discourse production showed a higher occurrence of discourse builders and a lower occurrence of discourse deficits in the advice-giving than in the social conversation condition. Findings in Study 2 indicated that both cognitively intact older adults and adults with dementia successfully taught students to prepare the recipes. However, the experimenter needed to prompt the adults with dementia more often than they did the older adults without dementia in order to get them to finish the cooking task. Implications: Both studies demonstrate that preserved discourse and role-related abilities in adults with dementia may allow these individuals to engage in interactions involving active, established social roles. This outcome may contribute to the establishment of effective practices in which adults with dementia can demonstrate preserved skills during activities and in social interactions with others. Purpose:\\u2002Because of the significant aging of the global population, world regions are experiencing an increase in the number of generations within families. However, to date most practice methods in the health and human services are explicitly organized by age. This article discusses a multigenerational practice approach and the impact of an infusion strategy to integrate multigenerational practice into social work education.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A required first-year MSW course was targeted for concentrated infusion of multigenerational content cutting across substantive areas. To compare students\\' perceptions and needs prior to and following the infusion of multigenerational content, students were surveyed, and mean scores were compared between the two time periods.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Although the majority of social work practitioners work in multigenerational settings, most have received training that has been fragmented by age and relevant to only one stage of the life course. The vast majority of students endorsed multigenerational issues as important to social work in general and to their own professional careers. Following the infusion of multigenerational content, students\\' knowledge and skills in multigenerational practice increased significantly.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A multigenerational practice framework honors the contributions, needs, and requirements of each generation as well as interdependence among generations. This approach prepares social work practitioners for practice, policy, and research that are more clearly relevant to the changing nature of the 21st century. The psychometric profile of 143 drivers with dementia who stopped driving did not differ from that of 58 individuals with dementia of similar severity who still drove. The reasons given for driving cessation by drivers with dementia as reported by a collateral source are reported. Purpose: The prevalence of depressive symptoms in elderly adults is high, yet the criteria to identify clinically significant depression may leave many elders undiagnosed and untreated. We explored the demographic and risk factor profiles of two groups, one with more severe depression and one with less severe depression. Design and Methods: The data come from the Duke University Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) baseline survey of 4,162 community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older. Results: The prevalence of depression meeting criteria of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES–D) and sub-threshold depression was 9.1% and 9.9%, respectively. In ordinal logistic regression, both CES–D and subthreshold depression were associated with impairment in physical functioning, disability days, poorer self-rated health, use of psychotropic medications, perceived low social support, female gender, and being unmarried. Implications:Depression appears to exist along a continuum, with demographic and social and physical health predictors of subthreshold depression similar to predictors of depression as defined by the CES–D scale. Purpose:\\u2002We contrast characteristics of respondents recruited using convenience strategies with those of respondents recruited by random digit dial (RDD) methods. We compare sample variances, means, and interrelationships among variables generated from the convenience and RDD samples.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Women aged 50 to 64 who work full time and provide care to a community-dwelling older person were recruited using either RDD (N = 55) or convenience methods (N = 87). Telephone interviews were conducted using reliable, valid measures of demographics, characteristics of the care recipient, help provided to the care recipient, evaluations of caregiver–care recipient relationship, and outcomes common to caregiving research.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Convenience and RDD samples had similar variances on 68.4% of the examined variables. We found significant mean differences for 63% of the variables examined. Bivariate correlations suggest that one would reach different conclusions using the convenience and RDD sample data sets.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Researchers should use convenience samples cautiously, as they may have limited generalizability. Purpose: This study investigated the use of private prayer among middle-aged and older patients as a way of coping with cardiac surgery and prayer\\'s relationship to optimism. Design and Methods: The measure of prayer included three aspects: (a) belief in the importance of private prayer, (b) faith in the efficacy of prayer on the basis of previous experiences, and (c) intention to use prayer to cope with the distress associated with surgery. The sample was 246 patients awaiting cardiac surgery. The first in-person interview was administered 2 weeks before surgery and optimism was measured the day before surgery by telephone. Results: Private prayer predicted optimism, along with older age, better socioeconomic resources, and healthier affect. Neither measures of general religiosity nor any type of prayers used by patients were associated with optimism. Implications: Suggestions were made for clinicians to improve spiritual assessment and care, and for researchers to address spiritual coping in clinical situations. Purpose: This study describes the Swedish debate on the role of family and state in care of elderly persons. It provides empirical evidence on the shifting balance of family, state, and market in the total panorama of elderly care. Design and Methods: Secondary analysis of older (1954) and more recent data sources (1994 and 2000) is used to assess living arrangements and care patterns for persons 75 years or older living in the community. Results: Total spending on aged adults has stagnated, and institutional care is shrinking in absolute and relative terms, but public Home Help for elders in the community is decreasing even more. Family members increasingly shoulder the bulk of care, but privately purchased care also seems to expand. This study calculates how public and informal care changed between 1994 and 2000: Informal care is estimated to have provided 60% of all care to elders in the community in 1994 and 70% in 2000. Implications: The results parallel a crisis of legitimacy of public elderly care in Sweden. They also call into question various metaphors used to describe patterns of care. Purpose:\\u2002This study attempts to determine the associations between postdischarge environmental (PDE) and socioeconomic (SES) factors and early readmission to hospitals.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study was a cohort study using the 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and Medicare claims for the period from 2001 to 2002. The participants were community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospitals, discharged home, and surviving at least 1 year after discharge (n = 1,351). The study measurements were early readmission (within 60 days), PDE factors, and SES factors. PDE factors consisted of having a usual source of care, requiring assistance to see the usual source of care, marital status, living alone, lacking self-management skills, having unmet functional need, having no helpers with activities of daily living, number of living children, and number of levels in the home. SES factors consisted of education, income, and Medicaid enrollment.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Of the 1,351 beneficiaries, 202 (15.0%) experienced an early readmission. After adjustment for demographics, health, and functional status, the odds of early readmission were increased by living alone (odds ratio or OR = 1.50, 95% confidence interval or CI = 1.01–2.24), having unmet functional need (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.04–2.10), lacking self-management skills (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.03–2.02), and having limited education (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.01–2.02).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings suggest that PDE and SES factors are associated with early readmission. Considering these findings may enhance the targeting of pre-discharge and postdischarge interventions to avert early readmission. Such interventions may include home health services, patient activation, and comprehensive discharge planning. Purpose:\\u2002Making good consumer decisions requires having good information. This study compared long-term-care recommendations among various types of health professionals. Design and Methods: We gave randomly varied scenarios to a convenience national sample of 211 professionals from varying disciplines and work locations. For each scenario, we asked the professional to recommend the appropriate forms of long-term care. Results: Although the professional respondents used the full spectrum of options offered to them, some professionals tended to favor the sector they worked in. Advanced practice nurses recommended day care and homemaking more and adult foster care less. Gerontologists used skilled nursing-facility placement more actively and rehabilitation, homemaking, and home health care less actively. Geriatricians and primary care physicians both favored rehabilitation and skilled nursing-facility care and were both less enthusiastic about assisted living, homemaking, and informal care, but the geriatricians favored day care more than did the primary care physicians. Registered nurses were highly supportive of assisted living, adult foster care, homemaking, and home health care, and they opposed skilled nursing-facility care. Social workers were less likely than other participants to endorse rehabilitation and adult foster care. Implications: Because consumer preference should be a major factor in making long-term-care decisions, many consumers need information about what options may best fit their situation. In the absence of empirical data on which types of long-term care work best for whom, consumers have to rely on expert judgment—but that judgment varies. Clients should be aware that an expert\\'s background (as defined by discipline and work situation) may affect his or her recommendations. Each discipline appears to have its own set of experiences and beliefs that may influence recommendations. Purpose:\\u2002Measures are lacking that address the challenges that people think they face in their roles as elderly care receivers. However, the development of a sense of efficacy in this role by mentally competent care receivers is critical to successful partnerships between caregivers and care receivers. The purpose of this article is to report the development and psychometric analysis of the Care-Receiver Efficacy Scale (CRES).\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Content validity, internal consistency reliability, factor structure, and convergent validity were assessed through a pilot study, expert review, and field administration with 177 participants.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Results suggest that the CRES comprises five subscales, with strong reliability evidenced for three subscales but marginal reliability for the remaining two. Strong support was found for content validity from expert review and moderate support from the relationship between empirical and expert judgment of item location. Support for validity also was found from correlation with the Geriatric Depression Scale–Short Form and the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale.\\u2003Implications:The CRES may be useful as an outcome measure for psycho-socio-behavioral interventions aimed at increasing the capacity of care receivers to direct and improve their own care. Future measure revision and validation are important to optimize its utility. Purpose:\\u2002The Veterans Affairs or VA health care system is in the process of significantly expanding home health care (HHC) nationwide. We describe VA HHC use in 2003 for all VA HHC users from 2002; we examine whether VA utilization across a broad spectrum of services differed for a sample of VA HHC users and their propensity-score-matched controls. We also consider crossover between the VA and Medicare.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This is a retrospective study using propensity score and stratified analysis to control for selection bias on observable characteristics. We examined the full cohort of 2002 VA HHC users (n = 24,169) and a 2:1 sample of age- and race-based nonusers (n = 53,356). Utilization measures included VA and Medicare outpatient, inpatient, nursing home, and hospice use, as well as VA home-based primary care, respite care, and adult day health care. \\u2003Results:\\u2002VA HHC users had a higher absolute probability of outpatient use by around 3%, of inpatient use by 12%, and nursing home use by 6% than their propensity-score-matched controls.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Veterans who used HHC services had a higher rate of VA service use in the subsequent year than controls did, even after we adjusted for differences in observed health status, eligibility advantages, and supplemental insurance status. High utilization for VA home health users spilled over into high Medicare utilization. Purpose:This study examined organizational and market factors associated with nursing homes that are most likely to be early adopters of innovations. Early adopter institutions, defined as the first 20% of facilities to adopt an innovation, are important because they subsequently facilitate the diffusion of innovations to others in the industry.Design and Methods:Two groups of innovations were examined, special care units and subacute care services. I used discrete-time logistic regression analysis and nationally representative data from 13,162 facilities at risk of being early adopters of innovations during twelve 6-month intervals from 1992 to 1997.Results:Organizational factors that increase the likelihood of early innovation adoption are larger bed size, chain membership, and high levels of private-pay residents. Four market factors that increase the likelihood of early innovation adoption are: a retrospective Medicaid reimbursement methodology, a more competitive environment, higher average income in the county, and a higher number of hospital beds in the county.Implications:This analysis shows that organizational and market characteristics of nursing homes affect their propensity toward early adoption of innovations. Some of the results may be useful for nursing home administrators and policy makers attempting to promote innovation. Purpose:\\u2002Our objective in this study was to compare Medicare costs of treating older adults with and without dementia in nursing home settings. Design and Methods: An expert panel established the dementia status of a stratified random sample of newly admitted residents in 59 Maryland nursing homes between 1992 and 1995. Medicare expenditures per-person month (PPM) were compared for 640 residents diagnosed with dementia and 636 with no dementia for 1 year preadmission and 2 years postadmission. Multivariate analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to identify the source of Medicare cost differentials between the two groups. Results: Medicare expenditures peaked in the month immediately preceding admission and dropped to preadmission levels by the third month in a nursing home. Adjusted PPM costs postadmission for the dementia group as a whole were 79% (p <.001) of the Medicare costs of treating residents without dementia. For the subgroup of residents admitted without a Medicare qualified stay (MQS), those with dementia had Medicare costs of just 63% (p <.001) of those without dementia. Overall Medicare costs PPM were insignificantly different between the two groups admitted with a MQS. Implications: Whether nursing home residents are admitted with a MQS is the single most important factor in assessing treatment cost differentials between residents admitted with and without dementia. Failure to consider this factor may lead researchers and policy makers to misdirect their attention from the true source of the differential—dementia patients admitted without a qualifying stay. Purpose:\\u2002This study explored the challenges in providing end-of-life care to low-income elders with multiple comorbid chronic conditions in a fully “integrated” managed care program, and it highlighted essential recommendations. Design and Methods: A case-study design was used that involved an extensive analysis of qualitative data from five focus groups with interdisciplinary team members, two in-depth interviews with administrators, and open-ended survey responses from social workers detailing death experiences of 120 elders. Results: Seven major themes characterized primary end-of-life care challenges: (a) the nature of advanced chronic disease; (b) the incapacity of support systems; (c) barriers to honoring care preferences; (d) challenges with characteristics and needs of participants; (e) needs of complex family systems; (f) barriers with transitions; and (g) barriers with culture and language. Implications: The lessons learned suggest recommendations with implications for program development, practice, policy, and future research. Purpose:\\u2002We identify environmental and organizational predictors that best discriminate between formal continuous quality improvement (CQI) adopters and nonadopters in nursing homes (NHs) and create a diagnostic profile for facility administrators and policy makers to promote CQI.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We performed a cross-sectional survey of licensed NH administrators in New Jersey in 1999, using The Nursing Care Quality Improvement Survey ( Zinn, Weech, & Brannon, 1998) and The New Jersey NH Profiles Chart. We also performed a discriminant analysis. Of 350 NHs, 46% returned completed questionnaires. Results: Using variance innovation, resource dependence, and institutional perspectives for our framework, we found that new requirements, environmental competition, organizational time and structural facilitators, and manager training made statistically significant contributions to discriminating between formal CQI adopters and nonadopters. Implications: Regardless of size, NHs adopt formal CQI to meet external expectations of new regulations and accreditation criteria. CQI adoption is facilitated by information systems, flexible use of personnel, and team supports, as well as CQI training for managers. This profile of adopters can guide administrators and policy makers in promoting CQI for NHs, and it can help NHs already interested in CQI focus internal resources on key facilitators. Purpose: This study evaluated how levels of social participation change as a result of late-life widowhood. Social participation is a multidimensional construct incorporating both formal (e.g., meeting attendance, religious participation, and volunteer obligations) and informal (e.g., telephone contact and social interactions with friends) social roles. Design and Methods: Using data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples study, analyses compared widowed persons to continuously married control participants to evaluate whether widowhood affects older adults\\' levels of social participation. Results: Widowed persons had higher levels of informal social participation than nonwidowed persons, whereas formal social participation levels were comparable between the two groups. Social participation levels decrease before the death of a spouse, primarily because of poor spousal health, and increase following the loss, because of increased support from friends and relatives. Implications: Maintaining continuity in the realm of social participation is a strategy older adults use to cope with spousal loss; however, not all widowed persons have the same resources to alter their levels of social participation. Purpose: The psychosocial needs of patients suffering from severe visual loss associated with advanced age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are generally ignored in the clinical routine. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a psychosocial intervention program for ARMD patients. This intervention program was based on six modules carried out in five weekly group sessions. These modules included (a) progressive muscle relaxation; (b) exchange of disease-related experiences; (c) understanding the connections among thought, emotion, and behavior; (d) description of and emphasis on the use of available resources; (e) improvement of general problem-solving skills, and (f) information exchange on ARMD-related treatment and rehabilitation options. Design and Methods: A preliminary evaluation of this intervention program was performed with the aid of a preintervention–postintervention comparison-group research design, which included 14 individuals (mean age of 73.1 years) in the interventional group and 8 participants (mean age of 72.6 years) in the comparison group. The preintervention–postintervention assessment addressed a set of emotional (e.g., positive and negative affect) as well as behavioral (e.g., limitations to activities and instrumental activities of daily living) outcome measures. Results: Although the sample size of the pilot evaluation test was small, our results demonstrate the usefulness of this pilot program. A statistical analysis comparing the interventional group with the comparison group revealed that the intervention group benefited from the program in five out of six outcome measures. Implications: Psychosocial group intervention is a promising approach to improve the quality of life in patients suffering from ARMD. An increasingly prevalent family constellation is a home headed\\n                                        by a grandparent who is raising grandchildren. We explore\\n                                        the state of our knowledge about such grandparents with\\n                                        particular attention to its implications for service\\n                                        providers and researchers. In our review we address several\\n                                        key areas: (a) the costs and benefits of raising a\\n                                        grandchild; (b) the heterogeneity of custodial grandparent\\n                                        caregivers; (c) the critical need for social support among\\n                                        custodial grandparents; (d) parenting practices and\\n                                        attitudes among grandparents raising grandchildren; and (e)\\n                                        helping efforts at multiple levels with custodial\\n                                        grandparents. We also discuss directions for research and\\n                                        practice concerning custodial grandparents. This article describes the prevalence, assessment, and treatment of, as well as characteristics associated with, the food and fluid intake of 407 residents with dementia in 45 assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Overall, 54% of observed residents had low food intake, and 51% had low fluid intake. Staff monitoring of residents, having meals in a public dining area, and the presence of noninstitutional features were each associated with higher food and fluid intake. Purpose: In published dementia caregiver intervention research, there is widespread failure to measure the level at which treatment was implemented as intended, thereby introducing threats to internal and external validity. The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of inducing and assessing treatment implementation (TI) strategies in caregiving trials and to propose Lichstein\\'s TI model as a potential guide. Design and Methods: The efforts of a large cooperative research study of caregiving interventions, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\\'s Caregiver Health (REACH), illustrates induction and assessment of the three components of TI: delivery, receipt, and enactment. Results: The approaches taken in REACH vary with the intervention protocols and include using treatment manuals, training and certification of interventionists, and continuous monitoring of actual imple-mentation. Implications: Investigation and description of treatment process variables allows researchers to understand which aspects of the intervention are responsible for therapeutic change, potentially resulting in development of more efficacious and efficient interventions. Purpose of Study: The authors determined short-term effects of a home environmental intervention on self-efficacy and upset in caregivers and daily function of dementia patients. They also determined if treatment effect varied by caregiver gender, race, and relationship to patient. Design and Methods: Families (N = 171) of dementia patients were randomized to intervention or usual care control group. The intervention involved 5 90-min home visits by occupational therapists who provided education and physical and social environmental modifi-cations. Results: Compared with controls, intervention caregivers reported fewer declines in patients\\' instrumental activities of daily living (p = .030) and less decline in self-care and fewer behavior problems in patients at 3 months post-test. Also, intervention spouses reported reduced upset (p = .049), women reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing behaviors (p = .038), and women (p = .049) and minorities (p = .037) reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing functional dependency. Implications: The environmental program appears to have a modest effect on dementia patients\\' IADL dependence. Also, among certain subgroups of caregivers the program improves self-efficacy and reduces upset in specific areas of caregiving. With the aging of the world\\'s population comes the rising need for qualified direct long-term-care (DLTC) workers (i.e., those who provide personal care to frail and disabled older adults). Developed nations are increasingly turning to immigrant women to fill these needs. In this article, we examine the impact of three global trends—population aging, globalization, and women\\'s migration—on the supply and demand for DLTC workers in the United States. Following an overview of these trends, we identify three areas with embedded social justice issues that are shaping the DLTC workforce in the United States, with a specific focus on immigrant workers in these settings. These include world poverty and economic inequalities, the feminization and colorization of labor (especially in long-term care), and empowerment and women\\'s rights. We conclude with a discussion of the contradictory effects that both population aging and globalization have on immigrant women, source countries, and the long-term-care workforce in the United States. We raise a number of policy, practice, and research implications and questions. For policy makers and long-term-care administrators in receiver nations such as the United States, the meeting of DLTC worker needs with immigrants may result in greater access to needed employees but also in the continued devaluation of eldercare as a profession. Source (supply) nations must balance the real and potential economic benefits of remittances from women who migrate for labor with the negative consequences of disrupting family care traditions and draining the long-term-care workforce of those countries. Recent worldwide events have focused greater attention on the Middle East. Little is known about the diverse populations of older persons living in the United States who have Middle Eastern origins and/or practice Islam. Stereotypes and backlash can negatively influence the quality of life for mid- and later-life individuals and their families. Gerontologists can improve conditions by incorporating new knowledge of these groups into research, policy, and practice to dispel stereotypes and provide appropriate services. This article focuses on the demographic characteristics and diversity among mid- and later-life Arab Americans, Muslims, and Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants. Further research is needed to shed light on the family support, social patterns, housing environments, health care needs, service utilization, and quality of life among immigrants and their descendants across the life course. Purpose:\\u2002Despite the documented benefits of physical activity, it remains difficult to motivate older adults to start and maintain regular physical activity. This study tested an innovative intervention for mobilizing older adults into a neighborhood-based walking program.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Researchers recruited a total of 260 healthy but insufficiently active adults aged 65 to 74 years and randomly selected from the Australian electoral roll from 30 Perth metropolitan neighborhoods. Social cognitive theory guided the design of the program. Researchers collected both qualitative and quantitative data to inform the development, together with ongoing process evaluation.\\u2003Results:\\u2002A total of 65% of participants completed the program. Their mean weekly walking time for recreation increased by about 100 min, and 80% of participants reported that they would continue to walk twice per week upon program completion. Implications: This practical program is potentially effective and sustainable with respect to mobilizing physically inactive older people. This study examines the effects of marital history on the burden of cardiovascular disease in midlife. With use of data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, a series of nested logistic regression models was used to estimate the association between marital history and the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. Results suggest that, in midlife, the continuously married and the never married are among the healthiest in cardiovascular outcomes. People with multiple marital losses are the most vulnerable group. People with multiple marital losses have a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease and will need significant formal and informal care as they advance into old age. Purpose: This study aims to develop an in-depth understanding of the issues important to primary care physicians in providing care to cognitively impaired elders. Design and Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 primary care physicians. Text coded as “cognitive impairment” was retrieved and analyzed by use of grounded theory analysis techniques. Results: A patient\\'s impaired ability to provide an accurate history and to participate in self-care hindered the usual process of care, often resulting in greater medical uncertainty and feelings of inadequacy and frustration for the physician. Shifting the goal of care from “curing” the patient\\'s illness to “caring” for the patient\\'s quality of life was also problematic. The doctor–patient relationship changed dramatically as others became involved in care, often with attendant ethical dilemmas related to patient autonomy and the locus of decision making. Many physicians described a deep sense of loss and grief as the personhood of patients faded. The increased complexity and prominent social and emotional issues were difficult to manage in the context of the current model of practice. Implications: Profound changes occur in the process of care with cognitively impaired patients. The increased complexity mandates an expanded model of care that addresses the prominent psychosocial and ethical aspects of care as well as the medical ones. Purpose:\\u2002The Providing Assistance to Caregivers in Transition (PACT) program offers nursing home discharge planning and case management for individuals in the transitional period following a return to the community. The PACT program targeted individuals newly admitted to nursing homes and worked with a family caregiver to develop and implement a nursing home discharge plan. Design and Method:\\u2002Reported are the results of a randomized control design evaluating the program\\'s effectiveness. Those individuals randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 33) received PACT case management in addition to their usual medical and nursing home care. The individuals in the control group (n = 29) continued their usual care.\\u2003Result:\\u2002There were no statistical differences in the discharge rate (84% treatment vs 76% controls) or in the median length of stay (42 days vs 55 days) between the two groups of individuals.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Replications or extensions of a PACT-type intervention might consider a broader mix of nursing homes, working directly with the nursing home\\'s admission Minimum Data Set coordinator in patient selection, or working with Medicare or Medicaid HMO plans. Purpose: Aggression continues to challenge caregivers of persons with dementia, and identification of foci for effective interventions is needed. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of (a) the resident characteristics of depression, communication, and cognition and (b) behavior management strategies on aggression in a group of older nursing home residents (N = 405) with evidence of dementia. Design and Methods: This cross-sectional correlational study examined the association of resident characteristics and behavior management strategies with bivariate aggression, physical aggression, and verbal aggression, using hierarchical regression. Results: Main findings are that impaired communication is associated with all forms of aggression, depression with physical aggression, and disorientation with verbal aggression. A 3-month prior pattern of antipsychotic drug use was consistently associated with all forms of aggression and physical restraint use with physical aggression. Most of the explained variance was attributable to antipsychotic drug use. Implications: The separate explanatory models for physical and verbal aggression indicate that these may be unique entities with different foci for treatment. These results provide evidence that aggression persists despite antipsychotic drug use and that further mental health interventions might be targeted at compensating for impaired communication and the treatment of depression to improve the mental health of nursing home residents with dementia. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of older women post hip fracture who were exposed to a motivational intervention, the Exercise Plus Program, intended to increase adherence to exercise.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study used a naturalistic inquiry. We interviewed a total of 70 older women, 12 months post hip fracture, using an interview guide asking about issues related to willingness to exercise. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed 44 codes that were categorized and reduced to 14 major themes. Eleven of these themes focused on components that facilitated participation in exercise and included: (a) real and expected benefits; (b) visual cues and knowing what to do; (c) simplicity; (d) individualized care; (e) verbal encouragement to exercise; (f) regular schedule; (g) confidence (i.e., self-efficacy); (h) determination; (i) social support; (j) reciprocity; and (k) goal identification. The remaining three themes reflected what decreased the participants\\' willingness to exercise: (a) unpleasant sensations; (b) constraints to exercise; and (c) getting back to baseline.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The findings provide some support for the benefit of the Exercise Plus Program. Lessons learned in the Exercise Plus Program can be translated to the development of other motivational interventions to help engage older adults in exercise, particularly those individuals who recently experienced an acute event, such as a hip fracture. This analysis uses data from the 1990 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to identify the individual-level characteristics that influence residential dependence among immigrants age 60 and older in the United States. Particular attention is given to differences among 11 immigrant groups. Separate models are shown by gender and marital status. The results indicate that Hispanic and most Asian immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, Central or South America, India, and the Pacific Islands, are at a greater risk of living with family than non-Hispanic White immigrants. Although resource, need, and demographic characteristics influence the risk of living with family, these individual-level characteristics do not explain the observed differences across the immigrant groups. These findings suggest that preferences that are shaped by the immigrant\\'s experience as well as cultural background are an important determinant of immigrant living arrangements in later life. Over the past four decades the environmental context of aging has come to play an important role in gerontological theory, research, and practice. Environmental gerontology (EG)—focused on the description, explanation, and modification or optimization of the relation between elderly persons and their sociospatial surroundings—has emerged as a subfield in its own right. The aim of this article is to reflect on the historical, empirical, and theoretical development of recent EG, following Parmelee and Lawton\\'s diagnosis from 1990 that there is a need to move the field beyond its current languishing state. From a historical perspective, EG has clearly played an important and successful role within the gerontology enterprise in terms of explicit consideration of the sociophysical environment in theory and research. A literature analysis of empirical studies supports the view that research has continued on a substantial quantitative level during the 1990s. Findings of these research studies address the whole diversity of classic EG research questions, but mostly in the sense of replication and extension. In terms of theoretical discussion, our analysis leads to the insight that EG may be described as a field high in conceptual aspiration (“world views”), but low with regard to making research and application-productive use of its theoretical achievements. Purpose:\\u2002We examined the adjustment to societal change following the fall of communism in a group of Soviet war veterans from Russia and the Ukraine. The focus of the study was on the dynamics of identity development, and especially generativity, in a period of intense social upheaval.\\u2003Design and Methods:We administered measures of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and generativity to 50 World War II veterans from five distinct areas of the former Soviet Union. We also conducted life-history interviews and made a thematic analysis of the transcripts.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Despite the loss of the system of government and values that had dominated their lives, most participants demonstrated positive well-being, and especially a high sense of generativity. They described their experience of societal change as having disturbed their past, present, and future sense of self. Most, however, had found ways of reaffirming a generative identity. For some, this meant maintaining a Soviet identity; for others, it meant taking a critical view of the history through which they had lived. The principal sustaining element among the participants as a whole was hope in their own families\\' future.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Major societal change of the kind experienced by Soviet war veterans in later life poses a challenge to a continued sense of generativity. These elderly veterans were able to meet this challenge, providing evidence of their resilience and the continuing strength of family bonds in the former Soviet Union at this time of debate about national identity. Purpose: Prevalence estimates of healthy behaviors and preventive care among older adults have not received sufficient attention, despite important health benefits such as longevity and better quality of life. Moreover, little is known about general population prevalences of older adults\\' efforts to change behavior, motivations to improve health behaviors, and perceived barriers to change. Design and Methods: This study estimates the prevalence of a wide range of health behaviors and preventive-care activities, self-reported behavior change, and perceived barriers to change in a 1996–1997 population-based survey of 17,354 Canadian adults aged 60 and older. Results: The findings indicate that a substantial proportion of older adults lead relatively inactive lives and often fall short of recommended standards for preventive health-care visits and screening tests. Moreover, nearly two thirds (63.2%) of older adults reported no efforts in the prior year to make changes to improve their health, and similar numbers (66.7%) indicated they thought no changes were needed. Differences in prevalences were found by gender, age, and education. Implications: Results from this study are useful for policy makers who need to prioritize public health efforts, researchers studying interventions, and health professionals developing preventive-care guidelines. Purpose: To examine the efficacy of a comprehensive behavior management skills training program for improving certified nursing assistants\\' (CNA) skill performance in the nursing home, to assess the effectiveness of a staff motivational system for maintaining newly acquired behavior management skills for a 6-month period, and to evaluate any resulting effects on resident agitation. Design and Methods: This study used a randomized clinical trial of 88 residents with behavior disturbances and 106 CNAs who cared for them in two urban nursing homes. After CNAs received 4 weeks of behavior management training, supervisory nursing staff implemented formal staff management (FSM), designed to maintain training effects over time. The supervisory staff used conventional staff management (CSM, usual supervisory routine) on control units. We completed behavioral observations and paper-and-pen assessments at baseline and repeated them during a 4-week post-intervention phase and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Results: During the immediate post-training phase, both the FSM and CSM groups improved five out of seven communication skills and the ability to delay physical assistance during care routines. Although CNAs showed a reduction in the use of ineffective behavior management strategies, they did not increase their use of effective behavioral strategies. Follow-up assessments suggested that the FSM system was more effective than CSM for maintaining and even improving communication skills over time. Resident agitation was reduced during care interactions and maintained at follow-up. Implications: The behavior management skills training program improved CNAs\\' ability to interact with behaviorally disturbed nursing home residents and produced sustained reductions in agitation. The FSM system was more effective for maintaining communication skills 6 months after training. Purpose:\\u2002We examine the methodological and economic policy implications of three operationalizations of retirement migration.\\u2003Design and Methods: We compared the traditional age-based definition of retirement migration and two retirement-based definitions, based on degree of labor-force participation and retirement income, by using the 2000 U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Sample. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The age-based definition overestimated the number of retired migrants, although the ranking of host and donor states remained relatively stable; nevertheless, states revealed different rates of change in inmigration and outmigration and income streams declined. Implications:\\u2002Retirement-based definitions are more useful and precise for those researchers considering the economic implication of retirement migration. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to assess whether there is an enduring gender difference in the ability of self-rated health to predict mortality and investigate whether self-reported physical health problems account for this difference.Design and Methods:Cox models for 4-year survival were fitted to data from successive cohorts aged 75–81 years registered with a primary care practice in the U.K. Midlands surveyed in 1981, 1988, and 1993–1995. Results:Self-rated health was consistently a stronger predictor in men (hazard ratio  \\\\({[}HR{]}\\\\ {=}\\\\ 2.7\\\\) \\u2060; 95% confidence interval  \\\\({[}CI{]}\\\\ {=}\\\\)  2.1–3.5) than it was in women (\\u2060 \\\\(HR\\\\ {=}\\\\ 1.9;\\\\ 95{\\\\%}\\\\)  \\\\(CI\\\\ {=}\\\\)  1.5–2.4). Women surveyed in 1993–1995 were more likely than men to report problems that were disabling but not life-threatening, whereas men were more likely to report potentially life-threatening problems. However, these differences did not explain the association of self-rated health with mortality. More than half of those who reported a potentially life-threatening problem said that their health was good.Implications:Self-rated health is more strongly associated with mortality in men, but this is unlikely to be explained by differences in the nature of their physical health problems. Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) whether certified nursing assistants (CNAs) are more committed to nursing home jobs when they perceive their jobs as enhanced (greater autonomy, use of knowledge, teamwork), and (b) whether CNA job commitment affects resident satisfaction.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002A qualitative exploration of management philosophy and practice and of CNAs\\' views of their jobs in 18 Massachusetts nursing homes formed the basis for a survey administered to 255 CNAs in 15 homes. A quality-of-life questionnaire was administered to 105 residents. Logistic regression accounting for clustering estimated the effect of personal characteristics, satisfaction with tangible job rewards, and aspects of job design on CNAs\\' intent to stay in current jobs. A general linear model estimated the effect of job commitment on residents\\' satisfaction with their relationship to nursing staff.\\u2003Results:\\u2002After we accounted for satisfaction with wages, benefits, and advancement opportunities, good basic supervision was most important in affecting CNAs\\' intent to stay in their jobs. Job enhancements were not significantly related to intent to stay. Residents were more satisfied with their relationships to nursing staff and their quality of life on units where a higher proportion of CNAs were committed to their jobs.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The finding that greater job commitment of CNAs is associated with better quality of relationships and life for residents implies that better jobs lead to better care. Culture change transformation that increases CNA autonomy, knowledge input, and teamwork may not increase workers\\' commitment to jobs without improvements in basic supervision. Purpose. Most patients and families with dementia are cared for in primary care clinics. These clinics are seldom designed to provide the necessary comprehensive care. The purpose of this article is to describe nonpharmacologic protocols for the management of patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease and their families that are administered as part of a multifaceted care-management intervention program in a multiracial primary care clinic. Design & Methods. The nonpharmacologic component for the integrated program of collaborative care was developed based on a literature review and previous clinical experience. The care is coordinated by a geriatric nurse practitioner who meets with patients, families, and the primary care physicians. The nonpharmacologic protocols included general educational guidelines about Alzheimer\\'s disease. Specific protocols to treat the common behavioral disturbances associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease also were developed. A major component of the intervention is a monthly psychoeducational support group for caregivers. Results. The intervention has been well accepted by patients, families, and physicians. Approximately one-half of the treatment group has participated in the support group regularly. Implications. The integration of behavioral interventions and team care within the primary care environment has been successful. Purpose:\\u2002The premise of this article is that interventions should be based explicitly on theory and basic research findings. Although there appears to be general agreement with that assertion, the connections among theory, research, and intervention in the field of gerontology are often tenuous or nonexistent. In this article, we argue for better integration of these three domains, providing two case studies from the Cornell Roybal Center that illustrate the positive role theory and research can play in intervention designs and broader applicability of findings.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Study 1 involved a social support intervention for persons making the transition to becoming a family caregiver. Study 2 was an organizational intervention designed to improve interpersonal relationships and increase mutual support between family caregivers and staff in nursing homes.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Several benefits emerged as a result of creating theoretically grounded and research-based interventions, including guidance for innovative intervention design and the production of findings that inform both basic research and intervention.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002A much closer link between theory and basic research and intervention studies is indicated, suggesting that current federal support of translational research initiatives is justified and worthy of expansion. Purpose:\\u2002This article reports the results of a randomized, controlled evaluation of Partners in Caregiving in a Special Care Environment, an intervention designed to improve communication and cooperation between staff and families of residents in nursing home dementia programs.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Participants included 388 family members and 384 nursing staff members recruited from 20 nursing homes, randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Project staff conducted training sessions on communication and conflict-resolution techniques with two groups at the intervention sites: staff and residents\\' family members, followed by a joint meeting with facility administrators.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Families, staff, residents, and facility programs in the intervention facilities all demonstrated positive outcomes from program participation. Families experienced significant improvement in communicating with staff and in staff behaviors toward them, and spouses of residents increased their care involvement. Staff reported reduced conflict with families and reduced depression; burnout for nurses increased for individuals in the control group but not those in the treatment group. Behavioral symptoms decreased for residents, and facilities implemented more family-focused programs.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002Effective staff and family partnerships are critical in caring for residents with dementia. The Partners in Caregiving in a Special Care Environment program is an evidence-based intervention that enables these partnerships to develop and thrive, translating into improved experiences for residents, families, and staff. Purpose: This article reports on the interest within the religious community in a medical–religious partnership model designed to address some of the health challenges communities face as the population continues to age and become more diverse. Design and Methods: A geographically and religiously diverse group of 183 clergy who were attending a continuing education program on theology and preaching were invited to complete a 16-item survey asking about their interest in working with hospitals to offer health-related programs and activities in their congregations. Another sample, this one consisting of 524 individuals from a religiously diverse group of congregations in Florida, was also asked about their interest in having health programs offered in their congregations. Results: Of the 54% of clergy who completed the surveys, 72% said it was “very important” and 28% said it was “somewhat important” to actively address the health needs of their congregations. Support for specific programs was also strong, with at least 80% reporting it was very likely they would support screenings, preventive interventions, and health-related classes in their congregations. Strong support was also found among the laity surveyed, with 85% expressing interest in faith-based health programs and 45% reporting they would be interested in helping organize and promote such programs. Implications: Health care systems and other organizations interested in addressing health needs of older adults can look to religious institutions for assistance in providing the information and support patients and family members need to prevent or minimize the impact of chronic illnesses. Purpose: To determine the accuracy of a telephone-screening system to identify persons eligible for home- and community-based long-term care. Design and Methods: Data from Michigan telephone screens were compared to data from in-person assessments using the Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS-HC). Weighted kappa statistics measured the level of agreement between the two assessments. Results: Overall, recommendations based on the telephone screen produced a marginal match compared to recommendations based on in-person assessment. “False positives” (individuals scoring as more impaired on the telephone screen than in person) occurred in 27% of all cases, while “false negatives” (individuals scoring as less impaired on the telephone screen) only occurred among 6% of the callers. Neither individual screen questions, source of information, location of the individual, timing between screen and assessment, nor temporal changes accounted for mismatches. Telephone screens resulted in an 11% savings over the cost of providing in-person assessments to all program seekers. Implications: The telephone screen has utility as a broad targeting mechanism that allows agencies to avoid costly in-person assessments for all program seekers. Evidence does not support use of the telephone screen alone to determine either medical eligibility or a specific level of care. Purpose: We describe the goals, development, operation, and outcomes of an intergenerational programmatic relationship between a private comprehensive college and a congregate facility that houses both independent-living apartments and assisted living for older adults. Design and Methods: Activities are based on a communal-developmental model that promotes \"learning with\" as opposed to \"doing for.\" We identify key components involved in implementing such a model and provide examples of the activities that constitute the programmatic relationship. We also identify program implementation challenges and discuss outcomes. Results: Faculty and students report that partnership activities provide excellent opportunities for increasing the understanding of aging and older adults. Residents report programs provide social, recreational, and educational benefits. Implications: Programmatic partnerships between colleges and residential facilities for older adults provide many benefits for students and residents. They require shared responsibility, deliberate and creative planning, and ongoing coordination. Purpose: Although persons with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) require increasingly more assistance with activities of daily living as their disease progresses, the caregiving environment has received little attention as a source of predictors of their survival time. We report here on a study to determine whether variation in survival time of persons with AD can be better explained by including caregiver variables such as coping style and depressive symptoms as predictors. Design and Methods: A sample of 193 persons with AD residing in the community and their family caregivers was used to estimate the parameters of a Cox regression model of survival time that included both caregiver characteristics and care-recipient impairments as covariates. Results: Caregiver wishfulness–intrapsychic coping was related to shorter care-recipient survival time, but instrumental and acceptance coping and caregiver depressive symptoms were not associated with survival time. Care-recipient impairments (dependency in activities of daily living, low score on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and problematic behaviors) were associated with shorter survival time. Implications: Because this study is the first to report the link between caregiver coping and care-recipient survival, further study to understand the dynamics is required. We discuss several possible mechanisms, including the possibility that caregivers engaging in wishfulness–intrapsychic coping are less psychologically available to the person with dementia. These caregivers may therefore provide less person-centered care that is responsive to the true capacities of the person with dementia, and thus they may inadvertently contribute to excess disability and consequent accelerated decline. Because wishfulness–intrapsychic coping was uncorrelated with instrumental or acceptance coping, our findings suggest that interventions to enhance coping skills among caregivers, which have focused primarily on increasing problem solving and acceptance coping, also may have to include specific attempts to reduce wishfulness–intrapsychic approaches to benefit not only the caregiver but the care recipient as well. Purpose:\\u2002This U.K. study explored how older adults with depression (treated and untreated) and the general older population conceptualize depression. A multicultural approach was used that incorporated the perspectives of Black Caribbean, South Asian, and White British older adults. The study sought to explore and compare beliefs about the nature and causes of depression, and to suggest ways in which these beliefs act to facilitate or deter older people from accessing treatment. Design and Methods: One hundred and ten in-depth separate interviews were conducted for 45 White British, 33 South Asian, and 32 Black Caribbean individuals. The interviews explored what the word depression meant to participants, and their beliefs regarding depression\\'s causes. Results: Depression was often viewed as an illness arising from adverse personal and social circumstances that accrue in old age. White British and Black Caribbean participants defined depression in terms of low mood and hopelessness; South Asian and Black Caribbean participants frequently defined depression in terms of worry. Those receiving antidepressants were more likely to acknowledge psychological symptoms of depression. Differences in attribution were found between the ethnic groups. Implications: A social model of depression is closer to the beliefs of older people than the traditional medical model. Culturally appropriate inquiries about recent life events could be used to facilitate discussion about depression. Our data suggest that many older adults would respond to probing by primary care physicians about their mood. Health and social care professionals need to be sensitive to the language of depression used by different ethnic groups. Purpose:\\u2002We sought to characterize self-neglect definitively as a geriatric syndrome by identifying an association with functional impairment.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002We performed a cross-sectional home evaluation of 100 community-living older adults referred by Adult Protective Services for geriatric self-neglect and 100 matched adults from a community geriatrics clinic. We made our assessments by using two manual muscle tests, a timed-gait test, a modified Physical Performance Test (mPPT), and the Kohlman Evaluation of Living Skills (KELS).\\u2003Results:\\u2002Participants in the self-neglect group had impaired mPPT (p <.077) and KELS (p <.001) scores compared with community-controls. Using analysis of covariance models, we found that self-neglect referral explained a significant proportion of the variance in KELS scores (32%; p <.001) but not in mPPT scores (22%; p =.49).\\u2003Implications:\\u2002The geriatric syndrome of self-neglect is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and appears to be independently associated with impairments in instrumental activities of daily living. The evaluation and treatment of geriatric self-neglect should be consistent with that of other geriatric syndromes. Purpose:\\u2003We assess how perceived rewards and problems with caregiving work and supervision relate to intent to leave among direct care workers who are employed in provider organizations participating in the Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) demonstration; we also examine how these relationships vary by provider type.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Direct care workers from 50 skilled nursing facilities, 39 home care agencies, 40 assisted living facilities, and 10 adult day services in five states completed a paper survey administered prior to the implementation of the BJBC interventions in each organization. We include direct care workers (n = 3,039) with complete data in the analyses using multinomial regression clustered by provider organization to compare those not at all likely to leave and those very likely to leave in the next year with a middle referent group who are somewhat likely to leave.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Logistic regression results were that work overload and lack of upward mobility increased intent to leave. Respondents with positive assessments of their supervisor, who valued helping others, and for whom the income was perceived as rewarding were less likely to be in the very likely to quit category and more likely to be in the stable category. Some differences between provider types are observed, especially between home care workers and those employed in facilities.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002These findings provide support for many of the management-practice improvements taking place in the field, including those implemented in the BJBC demonstration. Follow-up surveys will provide insight into their effectiveness. Earlier evidence was not conclusive about whether hearing loss is associated with mood (i.e., depressive symptoms and anhedonia) and social engagement (i.e., reduced psychosocial involvement and reduced activity levels) in elderly residents living in complex continuing-care facilities. If hearing impairment results in poor mood and lower levels of social engagement, then remedying hearing impairment might result in a higher quality of life.\\u2003Purpose:\\u2002The purpose of this study was to determine if functional hearing impairment in continuing-care residents is associated with mood and social engagement.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002This study included all residents in Ontario who were admitted to complex continuing-care facilities between April 2000 and March 2001. Through the Canadian Institute of Health Information, we gathered health information by using the Minimum Data Set 2.0 questionnaire. \\u2003Results:\\u2002The results were consistent with our hypothesized direct effect of functional hearing impairment on mood. Path analyses showed that hearing impairment impairs linguistic communication and that impaired linguistic communication is related to lower levels of mood and social engagement.\\u2003Implications:\\u2002This study adds to the literature supporting an association between hearing impairment and mood. It suggests that remedying hearing impairment may lower levels of poor mood in residents of complex continuing-care facilities. This, in turn, may reduce the negative effects of hearing impairment on social engagement and increase the quality of life for residents of these facilities. This study also suggests that questionnaires used to assess hearing, such as the Minimum Data Set 2.0, are suitable for early identification of hearing problems and may be used to refer residents to audiological services. Purpose:\\u2002The aims of this study were to reliably assess a range of social-cognitive functioning in frail seniors and to examine the association between measures of social cognition and nurses\\' ratings of residents\\' social functioning in a nursing home.\\u2003Design and Methods:\\u2002Forty nursing home residents with and without cognitive impairment completed 11 social cognition tasks on two occasions after assessment of their cognitive functioning with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination—Revised (CAMCOG), CAMCOG Executive Function, and two tests of working memory. Staff on the nursing units completed two measures of social behavior.\\u2003Results:\\u2002Participants completed the social cognition protocol without difficulty. The measures demonstrated good internal (median alpha =.75) and test–retest reliability (median correlation =.70). Four of the social cognition measures were significantly associated with the measures of cognitive functioning; three additional measures showed significant positive associations with subsets of the cognitive tests. Regression analyses revealed that measures of social cognition were significantly and independently associated with nurses\\' ratings of residents\\' social functioning after age, gender, education, and the four measures of cognitive functioning were controlled for. One measure of social cognition that assessed interpersonal problem-solving accounted for 45% of the variance in nurses\\' ratings of participants\\' social functioning (F = 41.35; df = 1,17; p <.001).Implications:\\u2002Measures of social cognition assess a domain of functioning that is not evaluated by traditional tests of cognitive status. These measures are informative about frail, older adults\\' ability to understand and respond to others and could be used to predict patterns of social functioning in nursing homes and other naturalistic settings. Purpose: This article presents a model for research and practice that expands on the biopsychosocial model to include the spiritual concerns of patients. Design and Methods: Literature review and philosophical inquiry were used. Results: The healing professions should serve the needs of patients as whole persons. Persons can be considered beings-in-relationship, and illness can be considered a disruption in biological relationships that in turn affects all the other relational aspects of a person. Spirituality concerns a person\\'s relationship with transcendence. Therefore, genuinely holistic health care must address the totality of the patient\\'s relational existence—physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. The literature suggests that many patients would like health professionals to attend to their spiritual needs, but health professionals must be morally cautious and eschew proselytizing in any form. Four general domains for measuring various aspects of spirituality are distinguished: religiosity, religious coping and support, spiritual well-being, and spiritual need. A framework for understanding the interactions between these domains is presented. Available instruments are reviewed and critiqued. An agenda for research in the spiritual aspects of illness and care at the end of life is proposed. Implications: Spiritual concerns are important to many patients, particularly at the end of life. Much work remains to be done in understanding the spiritual aspects of patient care and how to address spirituality in research and practice. Purpose:\\u2002We systematically measured the associations between environmental design features of nursing home special care units and the incidence of aggression, agitation, social withdrawal, depression, and psychotic problems among persons living there who have Alzheimer\\'s disease or a related disorder. Design and Methods:\\u2002We developed and tested a model of critical health-related environmental design features in settings for people with Alzheimer\\'s disease. We used hierarchical linear modeling statistical techniques to assess associations between seven environmental design features and behavioral health measures for 427 residents in 15 special care units. Behavioral health measures included the Cohen-Mansfield physical agitation, verbal agitation, and aggressive behavior scales, the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects depression and social withdrawal scales, and BEHAVE-AD (psychotic symptom list) misidentification and paranoid delusions scales. Statistical controls were included for the influence of, among others, cognitive status, need for assistance with activities of daily living, prescription drug use, amount of Alzheimer\\'s staff training, and staff-to-resident ratio. Although hierarchical linear modeling minimizes the risk of Type II—false positive—error, this exploratory study also pays special attention to avoiding Type I error—the failure to recognize possible relationships between behavioral health characteristics and independent variables. Results:\\u2002We found associations between each behavioral health measure and particular environmental design features, as well as between behavioral health measures and both resident and nonenvironmental facility variables. Implications:\\u2002This research demonstrates the potential that environment has for contributing to the improvement of Alzheimer\\'s symptoms. A balanced combination of pharmacologic, behavioral, and environmental approaches is likely to be most effective in improving the health, behavior, and quality of life of people with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Purpose: This article presents results of a survey of the attitudes and practices of managed care organizations (MCOs) concerning consumer direction. The study focused on understanding several alternative measures of consumer direction and the factors that are associated with the MCOs concerning those measures. Design and Methods: The MCOs that were surveyed provided capitated managed long-term care benefits to their Medicaid-eligible clients and were chosen because personal assistance service is a likely area for consumer-direction interest or practice. Results: Although the majority of the responding MCOs were found to be practicing some form of consumer direction, the experience is limited and underdeveloped. Two areas of concern seem to be most important in an organization\\'s decision to adopt a consumer choice or consumer-direction model: the balance of concerns about unprofitability and the perceived interest and benefit of the clients. Implications: This study suggests managed care and consumer direction can work together and provides a baseline to assess further development of their compatibility. Purpose: To understand the driving behavior of older adults, this study examines self-reported reasons for driving limitation or avoidance. Design and Methods: Baseline interviews were conducted (n = 2,046) as part of a community-based study of aging and physical performance in persons aged 55 years or older in Sonoma, California. Twenty-one medical and nonmedical reasons for limiting or avoiding driving were examined by age and gender. Results: Most older people continue to drive; however, many, especially older women, report one or more reasons to limit or avoid driving. Among medical reasons, problems with eyesight are by far the most often cited; no other health problem was identified as a major reason for limitation. Among nonmedical reasons, being concerned about an accident, being concerned about crime, and having no reason to drive were often cited. Important predictors of reported driving limitations were low income, limited functional status, and self-report of poor vision. Implications: Understanding factors that affect driving patterns in older adults, including medical and nonmedical reasons, will assist in developing both enhancements to extend safe driving years and responses to the consequences of driving reduction. Purpose:\\u2002Decisions concerning end-of-life care depend on information contained in advance directives that are documented in residents\\' charts in the nursing home. The availability of that information depends on the quality of the chart and on the location of the information in the chart. No research was found that compared directives by the manner in which they are collected and summarized in the chart. The goal of the proposed study was to clarify how advance directives are summarized in the patient\\'s record and to clarify how physicians perceive the same advance directives and formal orders.Design and Methods: The study involved 122 elderly persons who reside in one large (587 beds) nursing home. The authors collected data regarding the advance directives from three sources—Minimum Data Set (MDS), the front cover of the resident\\'s chart, and from inside the chart.Results:\\u2002The rates of documented advance directives found in this study are higher than those reported in the literature. Agreement rates between sources varied as a function of which sources were compared, as well as on the basis of which directive was examined. More specifically, the authors found higher rates of agreement between the information inside the chart and on the cover of the chart than between the MDS and the other two sources.Implications:\\u2002The reasons for discrepancies may lie in the different functions and procedures pertaining to these source documents.'"

      "Purpose: Researchers' knowledge regarding older users of illicit drugs is limited despite the increasing numbers of users. In this article, we apply a life course perspective to gain a further understanding of older adult drug use, specifically contrasting early- and late-onset heroin users. Design and Methods:We collected qualitative data from 29 older heroin users. Life course analysis focused on the users' experiences across the life span. Results:  The findings suggest that those aging into heroin use (late onset) are disadvantaged compared to those who are maturing in (early onset) except in areas of health. Implications: We propose that conceptualizing the use of heroin and other illicit drugs among older adults based on the user's life course trajectory will provide insights for social and health services, including drug treatment.\n",

      "Purpose: Individual expectations among community-dwelling older adults and their subsequent effect on placement status have recently been considered. Previous studies, however, have been limited by eligibility and exclusion criteria, treating expectations as a continuous measure, omitting potential confounders, and ignoring Race × Gender interactions. Design and Methods: We used data on 6,242 Black or White self-respondents who were 70 years old or older when they were enrolled in the survey of Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old. We modeled expectations for nursing home placement over the next 5 years, as well as actual placement status, by using multivariable multinomial and binomial logistic regression models. Results: Expectations are not normally distributed: 14% of the participants refused to answer, 51% estimated no chance, 10% indicated a 1% to 50% chance, 21% indicated an 11% to 50% chance and 4% indicated a 51% to 100% chance. Age, gender, education, social supports, and health status were associated with expectations, as well as an interaction effect for Black men. Age, social supports, health status, prior hospital or nursing home use, and expectations were associated with subsequent placement. Implications: Black and White older adults' expectations for nursing home placement rationally reflect their individual risk profiles and are associated with subsequent placement status. The expectations question may facilitate the early identification of high-risk individuals for further evaluation.\n",

      "Purpose: Turnover in nursing homes is a widespread problem adversely affecting care quality. Using complexity theory, we tested the effect of administrative climate, communication patterns, and the interaction between the two on turnover, controlling for facility context. Design and Methods: Perceptions of administrative climate and communication were collected from 3,449 employees in 164 randomly sampled nursing homes, and they were linked to secondary data on facility characteristics, resource allocation, and turnover. We used hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. Results: Climate and communication both affected turnover, but lower turnover was dependent on the interaction between climate and communication. In nursing homes with reward-based administrative climates, higher levels of communication openness and accuracy explained lower turnover of licensed vocational nurses and certified nurse assistants, relative to nursing homes with an ambiguous climate. Adequate staffing and longer tenure of the nursing director were also important predictors of turnover. Implications: Although context is important, managers can also influence turnover by addressing climate and communication patterns and by encouraging stable nursing leadership.\n",

      "Case studies are used extensively in gerontological and geriatric education and practice, especially to present clinically relevant examples and to illustrate abstract concepts, principles, and theories in the study of aging. This article reviews the important pedagogical, clinical, and ethical issues involved in their design and use, and presents an argument that both case study developers and discussants need to become more reflective when they think about the nature of writing and listening to case studies as stories. The major themes from the literature in narrative and clinical ethics on case studies as stories are surveyed, including consideration of both facts and values, the debate on generalization versus specificity, and the need for interpreters and commentators. The implications of these insights for teaching and clinical education are considered, including the importance of addressing the need for rich description, multiple voices, open-endedness, and critical analysis.\n",

      "Purpose: We first describe which states have produced nursing home report cards; second, we compare what information is provided in these report cards; third, we identify data sources used to produce the report cards; and, finally, we examine seven factors previously shown to be associated with the usefulness of report-card information and provide several examples from current reporting efforts to illustrate how nursing home report cards could be improved. Design and Methods: We searched the Web sites for each state agency responsible for elder affairs–nursing homes. For those states identified as having a nursing home report card, we further examined the information presented. Results: We identified 19 states as having nursing home report cards (AZ, CO, FL, IL, IN, IO, MD, MA, MS, NV, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, TX, UT, VT, and WI). The information presented in these report cards differs quite substantially across states, although the data sources for report cards do not differ substantially. How the information is presented and our evaluation of the usefulness of the information is also highly varied. Implications: Providing nursing home report-card information may be important in helping elders and their families choose a nursing facility. With 19 states identified in our research as providing nursing home report-card information on the World Wide Web, we were surprised and encouraged at this number of initiatives. We give some insight into the kinds of information that can be found on these report cards and what steps could be taken to improve how the information is presented.\n",

      "Purpose: We assessed nursing home staff and state nursing home surveyors regarding their knowledge and attitudes about urinary incontinence, its management, and the revised federal Tag F315 guidance for urinary incontinence. Design and Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey of a convenience sample of nursing home staff and state nursing home surveyors from a midwestern state attending two statewide workshops on the revised guidance. Results: Of 558 attendees, 500 (85%) responded, including 39% of the state's directors of nursing and 57% of state nursing home surveyors. There were striking deficiencies in knowledge regarding urinary incontinence and catheter care, with significant discrepancies by type of respondent, particularly between state surveyors and nursing home staff. Staff cited documentation and staffing levels as the most frequent concerns about implementation. Open-ended responses reflected the divergence of concerns and antagonism among the stakeholders, and staff nurses' feeling that F315 violated residents' rights. Implications: The revised Tag F315 guidance will be unlikely to improve the quality of urinary incontinence care in nursing homes because of significant knowledge and attitudinal discrepancies between nursing home staff and state surveyors, facility staff's focus on documentation and staffing, and reliance on implementation strategies known to be ineffective. Federal, state, and other urinary incontinence guideline efforts should focus on managerial structures and methods to improve quality nursing home care. Research is needed to address how nursing home residents and families define and value “quality” urinary incontinence management and to incorporate these in quality-improvement strategies and measures.\n",

      "Purpose: Our objective in this study was to compare the quality of care provided under the Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO), a special program designed to serve dually eligible older persons, to care provided to controls who received fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid managed care. Design and Methods: Two control groups were used; one was drawn from nonenrollees living in the same area (Control–In) and another from comparable individuals living in another urban area where the program was not available (Control–Out). Cohorts living in the community and in nursing homes were included. Quality measures for both groups included mortality rates, preventable hospital admissions, and preventable emergency room (ER) visits. For the community group, nursing home admission rates were also tracked. For nursing home residents, quality measures included quality indicators derived from the Minimum Data Set. Results: There were no differences in mortality rates for either cohort. MSHO had fewer short-stay nursing home admissions but no difference for stays 90 days or longer. MSHO community and nursing home residents had fewer preventable hospital and ER visits compared to Control–In. There were no major differences in nursing home quality indicator rates. Implications: The cost of changing the model of care for dual eligibles from a mixture of fee-for-service and managed care to a merged managed-care approach cannot be readily justified by the improvements in quality observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose: The aim of this study was to validate a pain scale for the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment instrument and examine prevalence of pain in major nursing home subpopulations, including type of admission and cognitive status. Design and Methods: This study considered validation of the MDS pain items and derivation of scale performed against the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), using Automatic Interaction Detection. The derivation data describe 95 postacute care nursing home patients who are able to communicate. The scale is then used in retrospective analysis of 34,675 Michigan nursing home residents. Results: A four-group scale was highly predictive of VAS pain scores (variance explanation 56%) and therefore quite valid in detecting pain. In the prevalence sample, only 47% of postacute patients compared to 63% of postadmission patients reported no pain, and these percentages rose with increasing cognitive impairment. Implications: Pain is prevalent in nursing home residents, especially in those with cognitive dysfunction, and often untreated.\n",

      "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age and patients' attribution of incontinence to aging on health-related behaviors associated with incontinence. Design and Methods: Participants in this study were 74 women who either sought treatment for urinary incontinence at a multidisciplinary continence program or volunteered for a randomized clinical trial of behavioral and drug therapy for incontinence. As part of their clinical evaluation, women were interviewed about how they managed their incontinence and their perceptions of what had caused the condition. Self-management of incontinence was defined as behaviors used to cope with incontinence, rather than treat or cure incontinence. Self-treatment was defined as self-implementation of Kegel exercises, and formal treatment was defined as interaction with a health care provider. Results: Over half of the respondents attributed their incontinence to aging. In multivariate analyses, age was associated with self-management of incontinence, but not self-treatment or formal treatment. In contrast, attribution of incontinence to aging was associated with self-management and self-treatment of incontinence. There was also a trend for attribution of incontinence to aging to be associated with formal treatment for incontinence. Women who attributed their incontinence to aging were less likely to have engaged in self-management strategies and to have received a previous evaluation or treatment; but, they were more likely to have engaged in self-treatment for incontinence. When other relevant variables were added to the regression models, perception that incontinence restricted one's activities became the most significant predictor of performing self-management strategies and performing Kegel exercises. Implications: Attribution to aging may be an impediment to seeking treatment. Education to promote understanding of the actual causes and treatment of urinary incontinence may encourage people to seek appropriate intervention. Additionally, whereas attribution to aging is an important factor contributing to health-related behaviors, other factors, such as perception that one's activities are restricted, may play an important role.\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet the special needs of and provide quality health care to nursing home residents, the health care workforce must be knowledgeable about the aging process. Health professionals are minimally prepared in their academic programs to care for older adults, and few programs have required rotations in geriatrics. Teaching nursing homes (TNHs) have shown promise as sites for the preparation of a health workforce to care for older adults in nursing homes as well as improvement of quality outcomes. This article reports on the process and recommendations of a TNH summit of experts in geriatric education and practice as to the feasibility of developing a sustainable and replicable TNH model that would prepare a professional workforce knowledgeable about and prepared to work in long-term care. The TNH summit identified characteristics of partnerships between academia, nursing home(s), and other stakeholders that would constitute a successful TNH collaboration. Goals of a TNH partnership between service and academia include interdisciplinary education and practice, research and dissemination of evidence-based practices, and benchmarks of a nursing home professional learning environment.\n",
