       "'Aging occurs in context. People age within their families, within their homes, within their neighborhoods, and within their societies. Too often, however, characteristics external to individuals are relegated to unexplained variance—the error—of health outcomes. With this Special Issue, The Gerontologist highlights the roles played by the physical and social environments in which people live, directly addressing whether and how neighborhoods affect the way we age. These 18 articles move the field forward conceptually and methodologically. They identify dimensions of neighborhoods that are important to health as well as those that are not, suggest ways to measure neighborhoods, demonstrate how to include elements of neighborhood into sophisticated qualitative and quantitative analyses, and offer information about where interventions are most likely to be effective.The Special Issue articles offer compelling evidence that neighborhoods shape a multitude of health outcomes, including subjective ratings of health and aging (Cain et al., 2018; Skinner, 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Spring, 2018; Wolff et al., 2018), depression and psychological well-being (Choi et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018), social isolation (Portacolone et al., 2018), person-place transactions (Hand et al., 2018), and quality of life (Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Ralston, 2018). The articles also show that neighborhood characteristics have an effect on behaviors, including walking for transport and recreation (Sugiyama et al., 2018), use of public space (Canham et al., 2018; Noon & Ayalon, 2018; Wanka, 2018), cognition (Lee & Waite, 2018), sleep (Bierman et al., 2018), and sex (Schafer et al., 2018).What is it about neighborhoods that mold the way we age? The Special Issue shows that neighborhood effects are diverse, and include the socioeconomic status of a community (Schafer et al., 2018), presence of older people (Wolff et al., 2018), crime (Lee & Waite, 2018), physical disorder (Bierman et al., 2018; Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), presence of local shops and services (Sugiyama et al., 2018), community resources including water, sanitation, and electricity (Ralston, 2018), and social cohesion (Cain et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018). Even the amount of sun and shade are important indicators of how neighborhoods can influence behavior (Noon & Ayalon 2018). Spring (2018) finds that it is the combination of lack of health services and commercial decline that has the most meaningful impact on health and that neighborhood characteristics have little effect in the short-term, but powerful effects when they are cumulative.It is clear from the Special Issue articles that neighborhood effects are complex, that they affect some people more than others, and that they affect people in different ways. Skinner (2018) explores how the intersection of global and local trends relating to population aging and rural change create contested spaces for rural aging, while Wanka (2018) examines why some older people withdraw from public spaces and how the urban environment affects this spatial disengagement. Wang and colleagues (2018) show that, among rural residents of China, neighborhood stressors stem from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, stressors derive from the social environment. Similarly, Choi and colleagues (2018) find that the effect of perceived neighborhood safety is greater among older adults with functional limitations than among those without these limitations and that perceived social cohesion is only related to psychological health among people with functional limitations. Smith and colleagues (2018) report that economically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods have higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods and that both economically vulnerable and high-income adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods suffer more depression and anxiety than those living in more affluent areas.Studying neighborhoods requires creativity, and the papers in this Special Issue display an impressive array of innovative methods for measuring the phenomena they seek to understand. Noon and Ayalon (2018) use visual research methods—still photography—to represent what a neighborhood looks like. Hand and colleagues (2018) use a combination of narrative interviews, go-along interviews, global positioning system tracking, and activity/travel diaries, to develop and implement a qualitative-geospatial approach to exploring how neighborhood and person transact to shape social connectedness. Canham and colleagues (2018) use community-based participatory action research to learn how to use shared amenity spaces in order to connect services and programs with tenants and provide opportunities for service providers to deliver services. Wolff and colleagues (2018) use geography-based analyses, demonstrating that compared to districts with an average rate of population aging, persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate hold more negative perceptions of aging and districts with slow population aging have significantly better perceptions of aging. Administrative data—data such as that collected by the U.S. Census—used by Schafer and colleagues (2018) is common, yet fraught with a host of methodological challenges that researchers must confront. Although self-perceptions (Bierman et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018), interviewer-rated assessments (Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), and ethnographic interviews (Portacolone et al., 2018) are not novel methods, when used to understand neighborhoods, they raise new issues that researchers must address. As Gobbens and van Assen (2018) demonstrate, understanding the perceptions that older people have of their environment requires a multifactorial measure.Analytically, studying neighborhoods is challenging because we cannot randomly assign people to live in a neighborhood. Rather, people move to places where people like them live, creating questions about whether findings are the result of individual or neighborhood-level variables. The nesting of people within neighborhoods is typically addressed using strategies that account for individual characteristics. Bierman and colleagues (2018), for example, find that neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in random effects models, but that the association is weakened in fixed effects model that control for age, education, sex, race, and marital status. Wang and colleagues (2018) find that after controlling for depression at baseline, symptoms decrease in neighborhoods where physical and social environments are better. From a qualitative perspective, Hand and colleagues (2018) demonstrate the unique understanding that different methods of data collection bring to our understanding of place. Portacolone and colleagues (2018) identify an overarching theme of tension between person and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerging from qualitative content analysis. They find that, although people express a longing to participate in society, their immersion in a reality dense with obstacles can make this desire difficult to attain.Several articles in the Special Issue make use of neighborhood data collected by large, representative panels, highlighting the rich opportunity these data sets have for increasing knowledge about the ways in which neighborhoods affect aging. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), National Health & Aging Trends Study (NHATS; Smith et al., 2018), Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; Spring, 2018), California Health Interview Survey (CHIS; Cain et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018), China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; Wang et al., 2018), German Aging Survey (DEAS; Wolff et al., 2018), WHO Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE; Ralston, 2018), and Health & Retirement Study (HRS; Bierman et al., 2018) have self-report and interviewer ratings of neighborhoods. When these data are merged with administrative datasets, the potential to learn how neighborhoods affect aging is tremendous.Understanding neighborhoods is important because they are places for optimizing interventions. Canham and colleagues (2018) find that shared amenity spaces can be used to connect services and programs with tenants. Noon and Ayalon (2018) call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities, yet caution that high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance in public spaces. Smith and colleagues (2018) show the negative effects that neighborhood gentrification can have on older people, suggesting that aging in place may have its drawbacks.These studies demonstrate that where we live and age matters for how we live and age. Collectively, they begin rather than end a set of important conversations. Questions about whether objective or subjective aspects of neighborhood have stronger influences on aging outcomes remain. We do not yet know what physical space—the block on which a person lives, their neighborhood, or their community—most affects outcomes since much of what we know about “neighborhoods” is based on administrative data as determined by Census tracts. In this vein, we need better understanding of how older people define their neighborhoods. We need more research about diverse aspects of contexts, including the built environment (e.g., access to health care, proximity to services), the natural environment (e.g., nearness of parks, presence of sidewalks, exposure to pollutants), the food environment (e.g., proximity to fast foods, supermarkets, availability of fresh produce), and the psychosocial environment (e.g., social cohesion; neighborhood safety; and opportunities to engage in meaningful activities, to contribute, to learn new skills, and to exercise existing skills).Moving forward in our understanding about neighborhoods requires efforts from disciplines that include psychology, sociology, geography, anthropology, economics, medicine, social work, law, and the humanities. Developments that are conceptually driven and methodologically rigorous will lead to interventions that will better the lives of older people and strengthen the places in which we all live.

Building on social capital literature, we assess how subjective appraisals of neighborhood quality are associated with self-reported health (SRH) for older adults.Research Design and MethodsCross-sectional analysis of the 2014 California Health Interview Survey, a representative survey of diverse, noninstitutionalized California residents. We use three measures of neighborhood quality: trustworthy neighbors, helpful neighbors, and feeling safe. Using weighted ordinary least squares regression, we assess the associations of trust, helpfulness, and safety to SRH, controlling for neighborhood, demographic, and health care variables. We then examine how these associations vary by household income.ResultsWe find that characterizing neighbors as helpful and feeling safe are associated with better SRH, even controlling for community, demographic, and health care variables. However, the importance of these dimensions varies across household income: helpfulness is positively associated, whereas trust is negatively associated with SRH for lower income residents; safety is positively associated with SRH in all but the lowest income residents. These findings show that social capital dimensions work differently from one another, and differentially affect the health of older adults.Discussion and ImplicationsScholarly analyses of neighborhood effects should include a range of social capital measures and stratify by household income. Our findings may also inform priority setting for social capital programs, especially for older adults with limited economic resources. Policies and programs should consider actions that raise perceptions of helpfulness and safety. Social capital, Health, Disparities (health, racial), Poverty, Well-being © The Author(s) 2017.

The aim is to build our understanding of rural as a dynamic context within which the processes, outcomes, and experiences of aging are created, confronted, and contested by older adults and their communities. A review of key developments within gerontology and rural studies reveals how competing policies, discourses, and practices relating to healthy aging and aging in place, rural citizenship and governmentality, and social inclusion and inequality combine in particular ways to empower or disempower a diverse range of older rural adults aging in a diverse range of rural communities. The article provides a contextually sensitive perspective on potential sources of conflict and exclusion for older adults in dynamic rural spaces and further enhances our understanding of how rural physical and social environments are constructed and experienced in older age. A framework for interrogating emergent questions about aging in rural contexts is developed and implications for advancing research, policy, and practice are discussed.

However, there is limited scholarship on the effects of gentrification on older adults, with most work focusing on those who leave rather than stay. This study examines the effects of remaining in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ self-rated health and mental health, with particular attention to outcomes for those who are economically vulnerable.Research Design and MethodsData are from 6,810 community-dwelling respondents in metropolitan areas from the first wave of the National Health & Aging Trends Study combined with the 1970–2010 National Neighborhood Change Database. We estimate the effects of gentrification on self-rated health and mental health separately using a quasi-experimental approach and comparing two methods: matching design and linear regression.ResultsEconomically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods reported higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods. Both economically vulnerable and higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had more depression and anxiety symptoms than those living in more affluent areas. Higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had poorer mental health than their counterparts in low-income neighborhoods.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings call attention to the complexity of gentrification, and the need for more research examining how the intersection of neighborhood and individual characteristics influences older adults’ health. Results reinforce the need for neighborhood-level interventions as well as relocation support to promote health in later life and caution against an overemphasis on aging in place.

Download all figuresAbstractBackground and ObjectivesProximity to health care, healthy foods, and recreation is linked to improved health in older adults while deterioration of the built environment is a risk factor for poor health. Yet, it remains unclear whether individuals prone to good health self-select into favorable built environments and how long-term exposure to deteriorated environments impacts health. This study uses a longitudinal framework to address these questions.Research Design and MethodsThe study analyzes 3,240 Americans aged 45 or older from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with good self-reported health at baseline, and follows them from 1999 to 2013. At each biennial survey wave, individual data are combined with data on services in the neighborhood of residence (defined as the zip code) from the Economic Census. The analysis overcomes the problem of residential self-selection by employing marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights.ResultsLogistic regression estimates indicate that long-term exposure to neighborhood built environments that lack health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, grocery stores, senior centers, and recreational facilities) and are commercially declined (i.e., have a high density of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) increases the risk of fair/poor self-rated health compared to more average neighborhoods. Short-term exposure to the same environments as compared to average neighborhoods has no bearing on self-rated health after adjusting for self-selection.Discussion and ImplicationsResults highlight the importance of expanding individuals’ access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods.

Comparably little is known about factors that contribute to SPA. Besides individual factors, the context a person lives in may shape SPA. Research has so far focused on country-level differences in age stereotypes, indicating that rapid population aging accompanies more negative age stereotypes. The present study expands previous research by investigating the impact of district-specific population aging within one country on different facets of SPA.Research Design and MethodsBased on a large representative survey in Germany, the study investigates changes in SPA as ongoing development as well as the SPA of physical loss over a 12-year period in adults aged 40+. The study uses several indicators of population aging (e.g., population development, average age, greying index), to identify four clusters differing in their pace of population aging. Based on three-level latent change models, these clusters were compared in their impact on changes in SPA.ResultsCompared to districts with an average rate of population aging, the study shows that persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate (C1) hold more negative SPA in both facets (ps = .01). Districts with slow population aging (C2) have significantly higher SPA ongoing development (p = .03).Discussion and ImplicationsThe study underlines the importance for regional differences in population aging on the development of SPA. In particular, societies should be aware that fast population aging may result in more negative SPA.

To date, the bulk of empirical disaster research concerning older adults has centered on the consequences of a disaster. This study focuses on older residents in a hurricane-prone community and investigates the extent and level of their reported preparedness for hurricanes, which takes place prior to a disaster.Research Design and MethodsThis study engaged year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 older individuals of 60–90 years of age. Transcripts were analyzed by qualitative content analysis integrating both inductive and deductive coding approaches.ResultsOlder respondents overwhelmingly practiced survival preparedness by only storing water and food supplies, but lacked efforts in planning and structural preparedness due to insufficient awareness and financial resources. Most respondents asserted hurricane readiness despite the shortage of preparation practices because “being prepared” is defined differently for different individuals. Many respondents claimed hurricane experience and subjective interpretation rather than objective nature of prior exposure appeared to have a greater influence over respondents’ reported preparedness behavior.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study adds to the emerging, but highly limited body of work specifically addressing disaster preparedness among older adults. The interview data inclusive of respondents’ voices and values suggest that expectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. More practical and age-specific interventions are needed to promote disaster preparedness of older adults.

Guided by the ecological extension of the Pearlin’s Stress Process Model, this study explores the rural and urban differences in neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms among older adults in China.Research Design and MethodsData came from two waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative survey. The study included 6,548 older adults ages 60 and above in 2011, with follow-up in 2013. Predictors (individual and neighborhood characteristics) were drawn from the 2011 baseline, and outcome, depressive symptoms, was extracted from the 2013 wave.ResultsMultilevel modeling results showed that after controlling for depressive symptoms at the baseline, symptoms decreased in neighborhoods where physical environment and social environment were better. Among rural respondents, neighborhood stressors stemmed mainly from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, the stressors came from the social environment.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study demonstrated and discussed the role that neighborhoods may play in reducing depressive symptoms in later life. Community organizers and policy makers are encouraged to ameliorate community environments to improve mental health among older adults in China.

A deeper understanding of factors contributing to social isolation can allow policymakers and health care providers to create policies and programs to alleviate the social isolation of these vulnerable and understudied individuals.Research Design and MethodsParticipants were recruited through the support of the Housing Authority and Police and Fire Departments of Richmond, California, a town with a high-crime rate. Fifty-nine ethnographic interviews were conducted with 20 individuals of 58–95 years of age. Transcripts and fieldnotes were analyzed with a focus on the specific factors contributing the social isolation of participants.ResultsAn overarching theme of tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerged from qualitative content analysis. A tension emerged between a longing to participate in society and the immersion in a reality so dense with obstacles that made participation in society difficult to attain. Four specific themes also emerged. Three themes demonstrated underlying factors of social isolation stemming from the personal sphere and the physical and social environment. The fourth theme illustrated participants’ desire for social integration.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings demonstrate the salience of interventions and programs to make neighborhoods safe and accessible to older residents. Findings also suggest a need to reframe the conceptual framework for social isolation to better measure and alleviate this public health problem.

The interwoven and complex nature of person and place points to methods that can examine these relationships in situ and explore meanings attached to places. Participatory geospatial methods can capture situated details about place that are not verbalized during interviews or otherwise discerned, and qualitative methods can explore interpretations, both helping to generate deep understandings of the relationships between person and place. This article describes a combined qualitative-geospatial approach for studying of older adults in neighborhoods and investigates the qualitative-geospatial approach developed, including its utility and feasibility in exploring person–place transactions in neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsWe developed and implemented a qualitative-geospatial approach to explore how neighborhood and person transact to shape sense of social connectedness in older adults. Methods included narrative interviews, go-along interviews, and global positioning system tracking with activity/travel diary completion followed by map-based interviews. We used a variety of data analysis methods with attention to fully utilizing diverse forms of data and integrating data during analysis. We reflected on and examined the utility and feasibility of the approach through a variety of methods.ResultsFindings indicate the unique understandings that each method contributes, the strengths of the overall approach, and the feasibility of implementing the approach. Discussion and ImplicationsThe developed approach has strong potential to generate knowledge about person–place transactions that can inform practice, planning, policy, and research to promote older adults’ well-being.

In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults’ perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics.Design and MethodsAssociations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the “Senioren Barometer.” Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF.ResultsSeven scales (comprising 3–9 items) of environment were constructed—housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental.ImplicationsThis study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance.

Policymakers increasingly recognize that “successful” aging policies must not only address physical health needs but also factors that influence subjective well-being.Design and MethodsTo investigate the influence of area-level distribution of “public goods” on well-being in a low- and middle-income setting, nationally representative WHO-Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey data is combined with district-level data that captures built resources and health system distribution. Multilevel regression modeling is utilized to explore how community context, including built resources and health infrastructure quality, influence older persons’ quality of life and how chronic health conditions may moderate this relationship while controlling for important individual characteristics.ResultsWhile controlling for individual and district level factors, it is found community level provision of built resources of basic services (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity, housing) has a modest but significant impact on older persons’ subjective well-being. Further, this effect on older persons’ perceptions of quality of life is moderated by individual chronic health status; individuals with a chronic health condition do not receive an equivalent benefit from district built condition like those without an illness do.ImplicationsThis work adds to the literature concerning the effect of environments in low- and middle-income countries on older adults’ subjective well-being. It also adds to the growing literature on the complex relationship between subjective well-being and health in diverse contexts.

Participants (N = 454) reported weekly frequency of WT and WR at baseline (2003–2004) and follow-up (2007–2008). Attributes of local destinations and routes were based on self-reported measures at baseline and included: proximity to utilitarian and recreational destinations, the number of such destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, street connectivity, and walking paths. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the associations of perceived destination and route attributes with changes in frequency of WT and WR.ResultsHigher levels of perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations, reporting a larger number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home and higher street connectivity were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WT. Higher levels of perceived proximity to recreational destinations and better walking paths were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WR. No curvilinear relationships were observed and baseline frequency of walking did not moderate the associations.Discussion and ImplicationsProximity of utilitarian and recreational destinations, well-connected streets, and better walking paths can be supportive of long-term participation in walking among middle-to-older aged adults. Environmental and policy initiatives focusing on such destination and route attributes have the potential to support residents’ aging in place.

Why do some older adults withdraw from the public, and which role does the (urban) environment play in spatial (dis-)engagement? Environmental gerontology’s model of person–environment (PE) fit suggests an interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity and wellbeing in later life. However, there is little research on how these dimensions are actually related. This study sets out to investigate this relationship and how PE can be better adapted for deprived neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsThe study follows a qualitative case studies approach, focusing on a deprived neighborhood in Vienna, Austria. Nonparticipant observations were conducted at this site and complemented by 13 episodic interviews with older residents.ResultsThe results challenge PE’s model of interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity, wellbeing, and autonomy in later life. Spatial agency in the deprived neighborhood was intense but so was spatial alienation and distancing oneself from one’s neighborhood. Drawing on notions of territorial stigma, this might be a coping strategy to prevent one’s self-identity from being “stained”. Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space.Discussion and ImplicationsPE can be complemented with intersubjective measures of environmental conditions (e.g., stigma) and spatial engagement. Gerontology should proceed to consider not only the poor, disadvantaged, disengaged elderly, but also the rebellious, resisting, provocative new generation of older adults.

A community-based participatory action research project conducted in Western Canada examined how to best use the shared amenity spaces in a low-income seniors’ apartment complex in order to connect services and programs with tenants and to provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and create new relationships toward collaboration and service delivery.Design and MethodsPre-move deliberative dialogue workshops (n = 4) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees). Workshop participants (n = 24) generated ideas and plans on how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants.ResultsShared dialogue led to community investment and asset sharing by integrating the knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. This article highlights how collaborative planning approaches for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming), within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and community spaces), can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors. Contextual challenges to service provision are discussed, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive programming, and long-term funding.ImplicationsProlonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults.

Nonetheless, to date, there has been limited research on everyday activities of urban older adults in public open spaces. The present study examined the activities of older adults in public open spaces in Israel with a specific focus on age and gender as potential variables of relevance.Research Design and MethodsUsing still photography, we systematically photographed four sessions in two different public outdoor settings attended by older Israelis. Still photographs were converted to narrative descriptions, and then coded, quantified, and compared using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe majority (311, 97%) of older adults arrived alone to the public setting. Of these, 44% formed a social group of two or more people, whereas the remaining older adults stayed alone. When social interactions occurred, they were primarily gender homogenous (69%); women were more likely to integrate in spontaneous social conversations and men were more likely to participate in common games.Discussions and ImplicationsOur findings call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities among older adults. The findings further stress the high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults, which do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance of public spaces.

By investigating both neighborhood and home as the sociospatial realms of older adults, we explore associations between health and place across multiple contexts. We also distinguish objective and subjective measures of place and disentangle their differential associations with cognition.Research Design and MethodsWe analyzed place effects on cognition from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 2,260) linked to neighborhood characteristics and crime data. We measured place in four ways: (a) objective indicators of neighborhood such as police-reported crime rates and interviewer-reported on presence of disordered conditions on the streets; (b) perceptions of neighborhood by respondents (perceived danger and social cohesion); (c) objective conditions of home (interviewer’s report on presence of clutters, odor, and messiness); (4) perceived social support, strain, and threat by household members. The MoCA-SA was used to assess cognitive functioning.ResultsSubjective interpretations appeared to have more direct effects on cognition than did objective indicators of neighborhood or home. When examining these living environments together, we found the association between neighborhood and cognition is partially explained by characteristics of home environment, especially perceived social support. We found a buffering effect of social support on cognition for women, not for men.Discussion and ImplicationsLate life living environments are important contexts for aging. Aging-in-Place interventions should address subjective interpretations of place to reduce future risks of cognitive decline.

We examine whether disordered neighborhoods are a key contextual determinant of sleep problems in late life, as well as how subjective social power—a sense of personal control and subjective social status—mediates and moderates this association. Central to this contribution is the use of econometric techniques that holistically control for time-stable factors that may bias estimated associations.Research Design and MethodsThree waves (2006, 2010, 2014) of the psychosocial subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,130) are analyzed with random-effects models that adjust for repeated observations, as well as fixed-effects models that additionally control for all time-stable confounders.ResultsNeighborhood disorder is associated with greater sleep problems in random-effects models, but this association is substantially weakened in a fixed-effects model. Personal control mediates this association, but does not moderate it. Subjective social status does not mediate the association, but does moderate it.Discussion and ImplicationsAlthough neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in older adults, this association is likely to be overestimated in analyses that do not compressively control for time-stable confounders. Rather than acting as dual mediators and moderators, perceived control and subjective social status play distinct roles in this association, with seniors at lower levels of subjective social status especially at risk for sleep problems due to neighborhood disorder.

Measures of environmental disorder were conducted by trained interviewers. Survey data were also linked to census tract information from the 2009 American Community Survey. We used actor–partner interdependence models to estimate the likelihood of reporting low sexual interest.ResultsThere was no observed association between neighborhood context (physical disorder or census tract socioeconomic disadvantage) and sexual interest, but husbands were more likely to report low sexual interest if they lived in more disorderly households. High marital quality protected against low sexual interest, but these evaluations did not mediate or moderate the putative effect of household disorder.Discussion and ImplicationsRegardless of the broader neighborhood context, helping older adults maintain an orderly home space may help sustain sexual functioning. Future research should consider how various features of the environment matter for additional aspects of late-life sexuality.

      "Aging occurs in context. People age within their families, within their homes, within their neighborhoods, and within their societies. Too often, however, characteristics external to individuals are relegated to unexplained variance—the error—of health outcomes. With this Special Issue, The Gerontologist highlights the roles played by the physical and social environments in which people live, directly addressing whether and how neighborhoods affect the way we age. These 18 articles move the field forward conceptually and methodologically. They identify dimensions of neighborhoods that are important to health as well as those that are not, suggest ways to measure neighborhoods, demonstrate how to include elements of neighborhood into sophisticated qualitative and quantitative analyses, and offer information about where interventions are most likely to be effective.The Special Issue articles offer compelling evidence that neighborhoods shape a multitude of health outcomes, including subjective ratings of health and aging (Cain et al., 2018; Skinner, 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Spring, 2018; Wolff et al., 2018), depression and psychological well-being (Choi et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018), social isolation (Portacolone et al., 2018), person-place transactions (Hand et al., 2018), and quality of life (Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Ralston, 2018). The articles also show that neighborhood characteristics have an effect on behaviors, including walking for transport and recreation (Sugiyama et al., 2018), use of public space (Canham et al., 2018; Noon & Ayalon, 2018; Wanka, 2018), cognition (Lee & Waite, 2018), sleep (Bierman et al., 2018), and sex (Schafer et al., 2018).What is it about neighborhoods that mold the way we age? The Special Issue shows that neighborhood effects are diverse, and include the socioeconomic status of a community (Schafer et al., 2018), presence of older people (Wolff et al., 2018), crime (Lee & Waite, 2018), physical disorder (Bierman et al., 2018; Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), presence of local shops and services (Sugiyama et al., 2018), community resources including water, sanitation, and electricity (Ralston, 2018), and social cohesion (Cain et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018). Even the amount of sun and shade are important indicators of how neighborhoods can influence behavior (Noon & Ayalon 2018). Spring (2018) finds that it is the combination of lack of health services and commercial decline that has the most meaningful impact on health and that neighborhood characteristics have little effect in the short-term, but powerful effects when they are cumulative.It is clear from the Special Issue articles that neighborhood effects are complex, that they affect some people more than others, and that they affect people in different ways. Skinner (2018) explores how the intersection of global and local trends relating to population aging and rural change create contested spaces for rural aging, while Wanka (2018) examines why some older people withdraw from public spaces and how the urban environment affects this spatial disengagement. Wang and colleagues (2018) show that, among rural residents of China, neighborhood stressors stem from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, stressors derive from the social environment. Similarly, Choi and colleagues (2018) find that the effect of perceived neighborhood safety is greater among older adults with functional limitations than among those without these limitations and that perceived social cohesion is only related to psychological health among people with functional limitations. Smith and colleagues (2018) report that economically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods have higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods and that both economically vulnerable and high-income adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods suffer more depression and anxiety than those living in more affluent areas.Studying neighborhoods requires creativity, and the papers in this Special Issue display an impressive array of innovative methods for measuring the phenomena they seek to understand. Noon and Ayalon (2018) use visual research methods—still photography—to represent what a neighborhood looks like. Hand and colleagues (2018) use a combination of narrative interviews, go-along interviews, global positioning system tracking, and activity/travel diaries, to develop and implement a qualitative-geospatial approach to exploring how neighborhood and person transact to shape social connectedness. Canham and colleagues (2018) use community-based participatory action research to learn how to use shared amenity spaces in order to connect services and programs with tenants and provide opportunities for service providers to deliver services. Wolff and colleagues (2018) use geography-based analyses, demonstrating that compared to districts with an average rate of population aging, persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate hold more negative perceptions of aging and districts with slow population aging have significantly better perceptions of aging. Administrative data—data such as that collected by the U.S. Census—used by Schafer and colleagues (2018) is common, yet fraught with a host of methodological challenges that researchers must confront. Although self-perceptions (Bierman et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018), interviewer-rated assessments (Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), and ethnographic interviews (Portacolone et al., 2018) are not novel methods, when used to understand neighborhoods, they raise new issues that researchers must address. As Gobbens and van Assen (2018) demonstrate, understanding the perceptions that older people have of their environment requires a multifactorial measure.Analytically, studying neighborhoods is challenging because we cannot randomly assign people to live in a neighborhood. Rather, people move to places where people like them live, creating questions about whether findings are the result of individual or neighborhood-level variables. The nesting of people within neighborhoods is typically addressed using strategies that account for individual characteristics. Bierman and colleagues (2018), for example, find that neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in random effects models, but that the association is weakened in fixed effects model that control for age, education, sex, race, and marital status. Wang and colleagues (2018) find that after controlling for depression at baseline, symptoms decrease in neighborhoods where physical and social environments are better. From a qualitative perspective, Hand and colleagues (2018) demonstrate the unique understanding that different methods of data collection bring to our understanding of place. Portacolone and colleagues (2018) identify an overarching theme of tension between person and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerging from qualitative content analysis. They find that, although people express a longing to participate in society, their immersion in a reality dense with obstacles can make this desire difficult to attain.Several articles in the Special Issue make use of neighborhood data collected by large, representative panels, highlighting the rich opportunity these data sets have for increasing knowledge about the ways in which neighborhoods affect aging. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), National Health & Aging Trends Study (NHATS; Smith et al., 2018), Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; Spring, 2018), California Health Interview Survey (CHIS; Cain et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018), China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; Wang et al., 2018), German Aging Survey (DEAS; Wolff et al., 2018), WHO Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE; Ralston, 2018), and Health & Retirement Study (HRS; Bierman et al., 2018) have self-report and interviewer ratings of neighborhoods. When these data are merged with administrative datasets, the potential to learn how neighborhoods affect aging is tremendous.Understanding neighborhoods is important because they are places for optimizing interventions. Canham and colleagues (2018) find that shared amenity spaces can be used to connect services and programs with tenants. Noon and Ayalon (2018) call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities, yet caution that high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance in public spaces. Smith and colleagues (2018) show the negative effects that neighborhood gentrification can have on older people, suggesting that aging in place may have its drawbacks.These studies demonstrate that where we live and age matters for how we live and age. Collectively, they begin rather than end a set of important conversations. Questions about whether objective or subjective aspects of neighborhood have stronger influences on aging outcomes remain. We do not yet know what physical space—the block on which a person lives, their neighborhood, or their community—most affects outcomes since much of what we know about “neighborhoods” is based on administrative data as determined by Census tracts. In this vein, we need better understanding of how older people define their neighborhoods. We need more research about diverse aspects of contexts, including the built environment (e.g., access to health care, proximity to services), the natural environment (e.g., nearness of parks, presence of sidewalks, exposure to pollutants), the food environment (e.g., proximity to fast foods, supermarkets, availability of fresh produce), and the psychosocial environment (e.g., social cohesion; neighborhood safety; and opportunities to engage in meaningful activities, to contribute, to learn new skills, and to exercise existing skills).Moving forward in our understanding about neighborhoods requires efforts from disciplines that include psychology, sociology, geography, anthropology, economics, medicine, social work, law, and the humanities. Developments that are conceptually driven and methodologically rigorous will lead to interventions that will better the lives of older people and strengthen the places in which we all live.

Building on social capital literature, we assess how subjective appraisals of neighborhood quality are associated with self-reported health (SRH) for older adults.Research Design and MethodsCross-sectional analysis of the 2014 California Health Interview Survey, a representative survey of diverse, noninstitutionalized California residents. We use three measures of neighborhood quality: trustworthy neighbors, helpful neighbors, and feeling safe. Using weighted ordinary least squares regression, we assess the associations of trust, helpfulness, and safety to SRH, controlling for neighborhood, demographic, and health care variables. We then examine how these associations vary by household income.ResultsWe find that characterizing neighbors as helpful and feeling safe are associated with better SRH, even controlling for community, demographic, and health care variables. However, the importance of these dimensions varies across household income: helpfulness is positively associated, whereas trust is negatively associated with SRH for lower income residents; safety is positively associated with SRH in all but the lowest income residents. These findings show that social capital dimensions work differently from one another, and differentially affect the health of older adults.Discussion and ImplicationsScholarly analyses of neighborhood effects should include a range of social capital measures and stratify by household income. Our findings may also inform priority setting for social capital programs, especially for older adults with limited economic resources. Policies and programs should consider actions that raise perceptions of helpfulness and safety. Social capital, Health, Disparities (health, racial), Poverty, Well-being © The Author(s) 2017.

The aim is to build our understanding of rural as a dynamic context within which the processes, outcomes, and experiences of aging are created, confronted, and contested by older adults and their communities. A review of key developments within gerontology and rural studies reveals how competing policies, discourses, and practices relating to healthy aging and aging in place, rural citizenship and governmentality, and social inclusion and inequality combine in particular ways to empower or disempower a diverse range of older rural adults aging in a diverse range of rural communities. The article provides a contextually sensitive perspective on potential sources of conflict and exclusion for older adults in dynamic rural spaces and further enhances our understanding of how rural physical and social environments are constructed and experienced in older age. A framework for interrogating emergent questions about aging in rural contexts is developed and implications for advancing research, policy, and practice are discussed.

However, there is limited scholarship on the effects of gentrification on older adults, with most work focusing on those who leave rather than stay. This study examines the effects of remaining in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ self-rated health and mental health, with particular attention to outcomes for those who are economically vulnerable.Research Design and MethodsData are from 6,810 community-dwelling respondents in metropolitan areas from the first wave of the National Health & Aging Trends Study combined with the 1970–2010 National Neighborhood Change Database. We estimate the effects of gentrification on self-rated health and mental health separately using a quasi-experimental approach and comparing two methods: matching design and linear regression.ResultsEconomically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods reported higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods. Both economically vulnerable and higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had more depression and anxiety symptoms than those living in more affluent areas. Higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had poorer mental health than their counterparts in low-income neighborhoods.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings call attention to the complexity of gentrification, and the need for more research examining how the intersection of neighborhood and individual characteristics influences older adults’ health. Results reinforce the need for neighborhood-level interventions as well as relocation support to promote health in later life and caution against an overemphasis on aging in place.

Download all figuresAbstractBackground and ObjectivesProximity to health care, healthy foods, and recreation is linked to improved health in older adults while deterioration of the built environment is a risk factor for poor health. Yet, it remains unclear whether individuals prone to good health self-select into favorable built environments and how long-term exposure to deteriorated environments impacts health. This study uses a longitudinal framework to address these questions.Research Design and MethodsThe study analyzes 3,240 Americans aged 45 or older from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with good self-reported health at baseline, and follows them from 1999 to 2013. At each biennial survey wave, individual data are combined with data on services in the neighborhood of residence (defined as the zip code) from the Economic Census. The analysis overcomes the problem of residential self-selection by employing marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights.ResultsLogistic regression estimates indicate that long-term exposure to neighborhood built environments that lack health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, grocery stores, senior centers, and recreational facilities) and are commercially declined (i.e., have a high density of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) increases the risk of fair/poor self-rated health compared to more average neighborhoods. Short-term exposure to the same environments as compared to average neighborhoods has no bearing on self-rated health after adjusting for self-selection.Discussion and ImplicationsResults highlight the importance of expanding individuals’ access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods.

Comparably little is known about factors that contribute to SPA. Besides individual factors, the context a person lives in may shape SPA. Research has so far focused on country-level differences in age stereotypes, indicating that rapid population aging accompanies more negative age stereotypes. The present study expands previous research by investigating the impact of district-specific population aging within one country on different facets of SPA.Research Design and MethodsBased on a large representative survey in Germany, the study investigates changes in SPA as ongoing development as well as the SPA of physical loss over a 12-year period in adults aged 40+. The study uses several indicators of population aging (e.g., population development, average age, greying index), to identify four clusters differing in their pace of population aging. Based on three-level latent change models, these clusters were compared in their impact on changes in SPA.ResultsCompared to districts with an average rate of population aging, the study shows that persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate (C1) hold more negative SPA in both facets (ps = .01). Districts with slow population aging (C2) have significantly higher SPA ongoing development (p = .03).Discussion and ImplicationsThe study underlines the importance for regional differences in population aging on the development of SPA. In particular, societies should be aware that fast population aging may result in more negative SPA.

To date, the bulk of empirical disaster research concerning older adults has centered on the consequences of a disaster. This study focuses on older residents in a hurricane-prone community and investigates the extent and level of their reported preparedness for hurricanes, which takes place prior to a disaster.Research Design and MethodsThis study engaged year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 older individuals of 60–90 years of age. Transcripts were analyzed by qualitative content analysis integrating both inductive and deductive coding approaches.ResultsOlder respondents overwhelmingly practiced survival preparedness by only storing water and food supplies, but lacked efforts in planning and structural preparedness due to insufficient awareness and financial resources. Most respondents asserted hurricane readiness despite the shortage of preparation practices because “being prepared” is defined differently for different individuals. Many respondents claimed hurricane experience and subjective interpretation rather than objective nature of prior exposure appeared to have a greater influence over respondents’ reported preparedness behavior.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study adds to the emerging, but highly limited body of work specifically addressing disaster preparedness among older adults. The interview data inclusive of respondents’ voices and values suggest that expectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. More practical and age-specific interventions are needed to promote disaster preparedness of older adults.

Guided by the ecological extension of the Pearlin’s Stress Process Model, this study explores the rural and urban differences in neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms among older adults in China.Research Design and MethodsData came from two waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative survey. The study included 6,548 older adults ages 60 and above in 2011, with follow-up in 2013. Predictors (individual and neighborhood characteristics) were drawn from the 2011 baseline, and outcome, depressive symptoms, was extracted from the 2013 wave.ResultsMultilevel modeling results showed that after controlling for depressive symptoms at the baseline, symptoms decreased in neighborhoods where physical environment and social environment were better. Among rural respondents, neighborhood stressors stemmed mainly from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, the stressors came from the social environment.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study demonstrated and discussed the role that neighborhoods may play in reducing depressive symptoms in later life. Community organizers and policy makers are encouraged to ameliorate community environments to improve mental health among older adults in China.

A deeper understanding of factors contributing to social isolation can allow policymakers and health care providers to create policies and programs to alleviate the social isolation of these vulnerable and understudied individuals.Research Design and MethodsParticipants were recruited through the support of the Housing Authority and Police and Fire Departments of Richmond, California, a town with a high-crime rate. Fifty-nine ethnographic interviews were conducted with 20 individuals of 58–95 years of age. Transcripts and fieldnotes were analyzed with a focus on the specific factors contributing the social isolation of participants.ResultsAn overarching theme of tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerged from qualitative content analysis. A tension emerged between a longing to participate in society and the immersion in a reality so dense with obstacles that made participation in society difficult to attain. Four specific themes also emerged. Three themes demonstrated underlying factors of social isolation stemming from the personal sphere and the physical and social environment. The fourth theme illustrated participants’ desire for social integration.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings demonstrate the salience of interventions and programs to make neighborhoods safe and accessible to older residents. Findings also suggest a need to reframe the conceptual framework for social isolation to better measure and alleviate this public health problem.

The interwoven and complex nature of person and place points to methods that can examine these relationships in situ and explore meanings attached to places. Participatory geospatial methods can capture situated details about place that are not verbalized during interviews or otherwise discerned, and qualitative methods can explore interpretations, both helping to generate deep understandings of the relationships between person and place. This article describes a combined qualitative-geospatial approach for studying of older adults in neighborhoods and investigates the qualitative-geospatial approach developed, including its utility and feasibility in exploring person–place transactions in neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsWe developed and implemented a qualitative-geospatial approach to explore how neighborhood and person transact to shape sense of social connectedness in older adults. Methods included narrative interviews, go-along interviews, and global positioning system tracking with activity/travel diary completion followed by map-based interviews. We used a variety of data analysis methods with attention to fully utilizing diverse forms of data and integrating data during analysis. We reflected on and examined the utility and feasibility of the approach through a variety of methods.ResultsFindings indicate the unique understandings that each method contributes, the strengths of the overall approach, and the feasibility of implementing the approach. Discussion and ImplicationsThe developed approach has strong potential to generate knowledge about person–place transactions that can inform practice, planning, policy, and research to promote older adults’ well-being.

In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults’ perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics.Design and MethodsAssociations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the “Senioren Barometer.” Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF.ResultsSeven scales (comprising 3–9 items) of environment were constructed—housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental.ImplicationsThis study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance.

Policymakers increasingly recognize that “successful” aging policies must not only address physical health needs but also factors that influence subjective well-being.Design and MethodsTo investigate the influence of area-level distribution of “public goods” on well-being in a low- and middle-income setting, nationally representative WHO-Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey data is combined with district-level data that captures built resources and health system distribution. Multilevel regression modeling is utilized to explore how community context, including built resources and health infrastructure quality, influence older persons’ quality of life and how chronic health conditions may moderate this relationship while controlling for important individual characteristics.ResultsWhile controlling for individual and district level factors, it is found community level provision of built resources of basic services (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity, housing) has a modest but significant impact on older persons’ subjective well-being. Further, this effect on older persons’ perceptions of quality of life is moderated by individual chronic health status; individuals with a chronic health condition do not receive an equivalent benefit from district built condition like those without an illness do.ImplicationsThis work adds to the literature concerning the effect of environments in low- and middle-income countries on older adults’ subjective well-being. It also adds to the growing literature on the complex relationship between subjective well-being and health in diverse contexts.

Participants (N = 454) reported weekly frequency of WT and WR at baseline (2003–2004) and follow-up (2007–2008). Attributes of local destinations and routes were based on self-reported measures at baseline and included: proximity to utilitarian and recreational destinations, the number of such destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, street connectivity, and walking paths. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the associations of perceived destination and route attributes with changes in frequency of WT and WR.ResultsHigher levels of perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations, reporting a larger number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home and higher street connectivity were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WT. Higher levels of perceived proximity to recreational destinations and better walking paths were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WR. No curvilinear relationships were observed and baseline frequency of walking did not moderate the associations.Discussion and ImplicationsProximity of utilitarian and recreational destinations, well-connected streets, and better walking paths can be supportive of long-term participation in walking among middle-to-older aged adults. Environmental and policy initiatives focusing on such destination and route attributes have the potential to support residents’ aging in place.

Why do some older adults withdraw from the public, and which role does the (urban) environment play in spatial (dis-)engagement? Environmental gerontology’s model of person–environment (PE) fit suggests an interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity and wellbeing in later life. However, there is little research on how these dimensions are actually related. This study sets out to investigate this relationship and how PE can be better adapted for deprived neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsThe study follows a qualitative case studies approach, focusing on a deprived neighborhood in Vienna, Austria. Nonparticipant observations were conducted at this site and complemented by 13 episodic interviews with older residents.ResultsThe results challenge PE’s model of interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity, wellbeing, and autonomy in later life. Spatial agency in the deprived neighborhood was intense but so was spatial alienation and distancing oneself from one’s neighborhood. Drawing on notions of territorial stigma, this might be a coping strategy to prevent one’s self-identity from being “stained”. Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space.Discussion and ImplicationsPE can be complemented with intersubjective measures of environmental conditions (e.g., stigma) and spatial engagement. Gerontology should proceed to consider not only the poor, disadvantaged, disengaged elderly, but also the rebellious, resisting, provocative new generation of older adults.

A community-based participatory action research project conducted in Western Canada examined how to best use the shared amenity spaces in a low-income seniors’ apartment complex in order to connect services and programs with tenants and to provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and create new relationships toward collaboration and service delivery.Design and MethodsPre-move deliberative dialogue workshops (n = 4) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees). Workshop participants (n = 24) generated ideas and plans on how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants.ResultsShared dialogue led to community investment and asset sharing by integrating the knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. This article highlights how collaborative planning approaches for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming), within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and community spaces), can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors. Contextual challenges to service provision are discussed, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive programming, and long-term funding.ImplicationsProlonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults.

Nonetheless, to date, there has been limited research on everyday activities of urban older adults in public open spaces. The present study examined the activities of older adults in public open spaces in Israel with a specific focus on age and gender as potential variables of relevance.Research Design and MethodsUsing still photography, we systematically photographed four sessions in two different public outdoor settings attended by older Israelis. Still photographs were converted to narrative descriptions, and then coded, quantified, and compared using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe majority (311, 97%) of older adults arrived alone to the public setting. Of these, 44% formed a social group of two or more people, whereas the remaining older adults stayed alone. When social interactions occurred, they were primarily gender homogenous (69%); women were more likely to integrate in spontaneous social conversations and men were more likely to participate in common games.Discussions and ImplicationsOur findings call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities among older adults. The findings further stress the high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults, which do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance of public spaces.

By investigating both neighborhood and home as the sociospatial realms of older adults, we explore associations between health and place across multiple contexts. We also distinguish objective and subjective measures of place and disentangle their differential associations with cognition.Research Design and MethodsWe analyzed place effects on cognition from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 2,260) linked to neighborhood characteristics and crime data. We measured place in four ways: (a) objective indicators of neighborhood such as police-reported crime rates and interviewer-reported on presence of disordered conditions on the streets; (b) perceptions of neighborhood by respondents (perceived danger and social cohesion); (c) objective conditions of home (interviewer’s report on presence of clutters, odor, and messiness); (4) perceived social support, strain, and threat by household members. The MoCA-SA was used to assess cognitive functioning.ResultsSubjective interpretations appeared to have more direct effects on cognition than did objective indicators of neighborhood or home. When examining these living environments together, we found the association between neighborhood and cognition is partially explained by characteristics of home environment, especially perceived social support. We found a buffering effect of social support on cognition for women, not for men.Discussion and ImplicationsLate life living environments are important contexts for aging. Aging-in-Place interventions should address subjective interpretations of place to reduce future risks of cognitive decline.

We examine whether disordered neighborhoods are a key contextual determinant of sleep problems in late life, as well as how subjective social power—a sense of personal control and subjective social status—mediates and moderates this association. Central to this contribution is the use of econometric techniques that holistically control for time-stable factors that may bias estimated associations.Research Design and MethodsThree waves (2006, 2010, 2014) of the psychosocial subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,130) are analyzed with random-effects models that adjust for repeated observations, as well as fixed-effects models that additionally control for all time-stable confounders.ResultsNeighborhood disorder is associated with greater sleep problems in random-effects models, but this association is substantially weakened in a fixed-effects model. Personal control mediates this association, but does not moderate it. Subjective social status does not mediate the association, but does moderate it.Discussion and ImplicationsAlthough neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in older adults, this association is likely to be overestimated in analyses that do not compressively control for time-stable confounders. Rather than acting as dual mediators and moderators, perceived control and subjective social status play distinct roles in this association, with seniors at lower levels of subjective social status especially at risk for sleep problems due to neighborhood disorder.

Measures of environmental disorder were conducted by trained interviewers. Survey data were also linked to census tract information from the 2009 American Community Survey. We used actor–partner interdependence models to estimate the likelihood of reporting low sexual interest.ResultsThere was no observed association between neighborhood context (physical disorder or census tract socioeconomic disadvantage) and sexual interest, but husbands were more likely to report low sexual interest if they lived in more disorderly households. High marital quality protected against low sexual interest, but these evaluations did not mediate or moderate the putative effect of household disorder.Discussion and ImplicationsRegardless of the broader neighborhood context, helping older adults maintain an orderly home space may help sustain sexual functioning. Future research should consider how various features of the environment matter for additional aspects of late-life sexuality.
