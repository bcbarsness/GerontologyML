       "'Aging occurs in context. People age within their families, within their homes, within their neighborhoods, and within their societies. Too often, however, characteristics external to individuals are relegated to unexplained variance—the error—of health outcomes. With this Special Issue, The Gerontologist highlights the roles played by the physical and social environments in which people live, directly addressing whether and how neighborhoods affect the way we age. These 18 articles move the field forward conceptually and methodologically. They identify dimensions of neighborhoods that are important to health as well as those that are not, suggest ways to measure neighborhoods, demonstrate how to include elements of neighborhood into sophisticated qualitative and quantitative analyses, and offer information about where interventions are most likely to be effective.The Special Issue articles offer compelling evidence that neighborhoods shape a multitude of health outcomes, including subjective ratings of health and aging (Cain et al., 2018; Skinner, 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Spring, 2018; Wolff et al., 2018), depression and psychological well-being (Choi et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018), social isolation (Portacolone et al., 2018), person-place transactions (Hand et al., 2018), and quality of life (Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Ralston, 2018). The articles also show that neighborhood characteristics have an effect on behaviors, including walking for transport and recreation (Sugiyama et al., 2018), use of public space (Canham et al., 2018; Noon & Ayalon, 2018; Wanka, 2018), cognition (Lee & Waite, 2018), sleep (Bierman et al., 2018), and sex (Schafer et al., 2018).What is it about neighborhoods that mold the way we age? The Special Issue shows that neighborhood effects are diverse, and include the socioeconomic status of a community (Schafer et al., 2018), presence of older people (Wolff et al., 2018), crime (Lee & Waite, 2018), physical disorder (Bierman et al., 2018; Gobbens & van Assen, 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), presence of local shops and services (Sugiyama et al., 2018), community resources including water, sanitation, and electricity (Ralston, 2018), and social cohesion (Cain et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018). Even the amount of sun and shade are important indicators of how neighborhoods can influence behavior (Noon & Ayalon 2018). Spring (2018) finds that it is the combination of lack of health services and commercial decline that has the most meaningful impact on health and that neighborhood characteristics have little effect in the short-term, but powerful effects when they are cumulative.It is clear from the Special Issue articles that neighborhood effects are complex, that they affect some people more than others, and that they affect people in different ways. Skinner (2018) explores how the intersection of global and local trends relating to population aging and rural change create contested spaces for rural aging, while Wanka (2018) examines why some older people withdraw from public spaces and how the urban environment affects this spatial disengagement. Wang and colleagues (2018) show that, among rural residents of China, neighborhood stressors stem from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, stressors derive from the social environment. Similarly, Choi and colleagues (2018) find that the effect of perceived neighborhood safety is greater among older adults with functional limitations than among those without these limitations and that perceived social cohesion is only related to psychological health among people with functional limitations. Smith and colleagues (2018) report that economically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods have higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods and that both economically vulnerable and high-income adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods suffer more depression and anxiety than those living in more affluent areas.Studying neighborhoods requires creativity, and the papers in this Special Issue display an impressive array of innovative methods for measuring the phenomena they seek to understand. Noon and Ayalon (2018) use visual research methods—still photography—to represent what a neighborhood looks like. Hand and colleagues (2018) use a combination of narrative interviews, go-along interviews, global positioning system tracking, and activity/travel diaries, to develop and implement a qualitative-geospatial approach to exploring how neighborhood and person transact to shape social connectedness. Canham and colleagues (2018) use community-based participatory action research to learn how to use shared amenity spaces in order to connect services and programs with tenants and provide opportunities for service providers to deliver services. Wolff and colleagues (2018) use geography-based analyses, demonstrating that compared to districts with an average rate of population aging, persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate hold more negative perceptions of aging and districts with slow population aging have significantly better perceptions of aging. Administrative data—data such as that collected by the U.S. Census—used by Schafer and colleagues (2018) is common, yet fraught with a host of methodological challenges that researchers must confront. Although self-perceptions (Bierman et al., 2018; Lee & Waite, 2018), interviewer-rated assessments (Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), and ethnographic interviews (Portacolone et al., 2018) are not novel methods, when used to understand neighborhoods, they raise new issues that researchers must address. As Gobbens and van Assen (2018) demonstrate, understanding the perceptions that older people have of their environment requires a multifactorial measure.Analytically, studying neighborhoods is challenging because we cannot randomly assign people to live in a neighborhood. Rather, people move to places where people like them live, creating questions about whether findings are the result of individual or neighborhood-level variables. The nesting of people within neighborhoods is typically addressed using strategies that account for individual characteristics. Bierman and colleagues (2018), for example, find that neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in random effects models, but that the association is weakened in fixed effects model that control for age, education, sex, race, and marital status. Wang and colleagues (2018) find that after controlling for depression at baseline, symptoms decrease in neighborhoods where physical and social environments are better. From a qualitative perspective, Hand and colleagues (2018) demonstrate the unique understanding that different methods of data collection bring to our understanding of place. Portacolone and colleagues (2018) identify an overarching theme of tension between person and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerging from qualitative content analysis. They find that, although people express a longing to participate in society, their immersion in a reality dense with obstacles can make this desire difficult to attain.Several articles in the Special Issue make use of neighborhood data collected by large, representative panels, highlighting the rich opportunity these data sets have for increasing knowledge about the ways in which neighborhoods affect aging. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP; Lee & Waite, 2018; Schafer et al., 2018), National Health & Aging Trends Study (NHATS; Smith et al., 2018), Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; Spring, 2018), California Health Interview Survey (CHIS; Cain et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018), China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; Wang et al., 2018), German Aging Survey (DEAS; Wolff et al., 2018), WHO Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE; Ralston, 2018), and Health & Retirement Study (HRS; Bierman et al., 2018) have self-report and interviewer ratings of neighborhoods. When these data are merged with administrative datasets, the potential to learn how neighborhoods affect aging is tremendous.Understanding neighborhoods is important because they are places for optimizing interventions. Canham and colleagues (2018) find that shared amenity spaces can be used to connect services and programs with tenants. Noon and Ayalon (2018) call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities, yet caution that high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance in public spaces. Smith and colleagues (2018) show the negative effects that neighborhood gentrification can have on older people, suggesting that aging in place may have its drawbacks.These studies demonstrate that where we live and age matters for how we live and age. Collectively, they begin rather than end a set of important conversations. Questions about whether objective or subjective aspects of neighborhood have stronger influences on aging outcomes remain. We do not yet know what physical space—the block on which a person lives, their neighborhood, or their community—most affects outcomes since much of what we know about “neighborhoods” is based on administrative data as determined by Census tracts. In this vein, we need better understanding of how older people define their neighborhoods. We need more research about diverse aspects of contexts, including the built environment (e.g., access to health care, proximity to services), the natural environment (e.g., nearness of parks, presence of sidewalks, exposure to pollutants), the food environment (e.g., proximity to fast foods, supermarkets, availability of fresh produce), and the psychosocial environment (e.g., social cohesion; neighborhood safety; and opportunities to engage in meaningful activities, to contribute, to learn new skills, and to exercise existing skills).Moving forward in our understanding about neighborhoods requires efforts from disciplines that include psychology, sociology, geography, anthropology, economics, medicine, social work, law, and the humanities. Developments that are conceptually driven and methodologically rigorous will lead to interventions that will better the lives of older people and strengthen the places in which we all live.

Building on social capital literature, we assess how subjective appraisals of neighborhood quality are associated with self-reported health (SRH) for older adults.Research Design and MethodsCross-sectional analysis of the 2014 California Health Interview Survey, a representative survey of diverse, noninstitutionalized California residents. We use three measures of neighborhood quality: trustworthy neighbors, helpful neighbors, and feeling safe. Using weighted ordinary least squares regression, we assess the associations of trust, helpfulness, and safety to SRH, controlling for neighborhood, demographic, and health care variables. We then examine how these associations vary by household income.ResultsWe find that characterizing neighbors as helpful and feeling safe are associated with better SRH, even controlling for community, demographic, and health care variables. However, the importance of these dimensions varies across household income: helpfulness is positively associated, whereas trust is negatively associated with SRH for lower income residents; safety is positively associated with SRH in all but the lowest income residents. These findings show that social capital dimensions work differently from one another, and differentially affect the health of older adults.Discussion and ImplicationsScholarly analyses of neighborhood effects should include a range of social capital measures and stratify by household income. Our findings may also inform priority setting for social capital programs, especially for older adults with limited economic resources. Policies and programs should consider actions that raise perceptions of helpfulness and safety. Social capital, Health, Disparities (health, racial), Poverty, Well-being © The Author(s) 2017.

The aim is to build our understanding of rural as a dynamic context within which the processes, outcomes, and experiences of aging are created, confronted, and contested by older adults and their communities. A review of key developments within gerontology and rural studies reveals how competing policies, discourses, and practices relating to healthy aging and aging in place, rural citizenship and governmentality, and social inclusion and inequality combine in particular ways to empower or disempower a diverse range of older rural adults aging in a diverse range of rural communities. The article provides a contextually sensitive perspective on potential sources of conflict and exclusion for older adults in dynamic rural spaces and further enhances our understanding of how rural physical and social environments are constructed and experienced in older age. A framework for interrogating emergent questions about aging in rural contexts is developed and implications for advancing research, policy, and practice are discussed.

However, there is limited scholarship on the effects of gentrification on older adults, with most work focusing on those who leave rather than stay. This study examines the effects of remaining in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ self-rated health and mental health, with particular attention to outcomes for those who are economically vulnerable.Research Design and MethodsData are from 6,810 community-dwelling respondents in metropolitan areas from the first wave of the National Health & Aging Trends Study combined with the 1970–2010 National Neighborhood Change Database. We estimate the effects of gentrification on self-rated health and mental health separately using a quasi-experimental approach and comparing two methods: matching design and linear regression.ResultsEconomically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods reported higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods. Both economically vulnerable and higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had more depression and anxiety symptoms than those living in more affluent areas. Higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had poorer mental health than their counterparts in low-income neighborhoods.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings call attention to the complexity of gentrification, and the need for more research examining how the intersection of neighborhood and individual characteristics influences older adults’ health. Results reinforce the need for neighborhood-level interventions as well as relocation support to promote health in later life and caution against an overemphasis on aging in place.

Download all figuresAbstractBackground and ObjectivesProximity to health care, healthy foods, and recreation is linked to improved health in older adults while deterioration of the built environment is a risk factor for poor health. Yet, it remains unclear whether individuals prone to good health self-select into favorable built environments and how long-term exposure to deteriorated environments impacts health. This study uses a longitudinal framework to address these questions.Research Design and MethodsThe study analyzes 3,240 Americans aged 45 or older from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with good self-reported health at baseline, and follows them from 1999 to 2013. At each biennial survey wave, individual data are combined with data on services in the neighborhood of residence (defined as the zip code) from the Economic Census. The analysis overcomes the problem of residential self-selection by employing marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights.ResultsLogistic regression estimates indicate that long-term exposure to neighborhood built environments that lack health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, grocery stores, senior centers, and recreational facilities) and are commercially declined (i.e., have a high density of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) increases the risk of fair/poor self-rated health compared to more average neighborhoods. Short-term exposure to the same environments as compared to average neighborhoods has no bearing on self-rated health after adjusting for self-selection.Discussion and ImplicationsResults highlight the importance of expanding individuals’ access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods.

Comparably little is known about factors that contribute to SPA. Besides individual factors, the context a person lives in may shape SPA. Research has so far focused on country-level differences in age stereotypes, indicating that rapid population aging accompanies more negative age stereotypes. The present study expands previous research by investigating the impact of district-specific population aging within one country on different facets of SPA.Research Design and MethodsBased on a large representative survey in Germany, the study investigates changes in SPA as ongoing development as well as the SPA of physical loss over a 12-year period in adults aged 40+. The study uses several indicators of population aging (e.g., population development, average age, greying index), to identify four clusters differing in their pace of population aging. Based on three-level latent change models, these clusters were compared in their impact on changes in SPA.ResultsCompared to districts with an average rate of population aging, the study shows that persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate (C1) hold more negative SPA in both facets (ps = .01). Districts with slow population aging (C2) have significantly higher SPA ongoing development (p = .03).Discussion and ImplicationsThe study underlines the importance for regional differences in population aging on the development of SPA. In particular, societies should be aware that fast population aging may result in more negative SPA.

To date, the bulk of empirical disaster research concerning older adults has centered on the consequences of a disaster. This study focuses on older residents in a hurricane-prone community and investigates the extent and level of their reported preparedness for hurricanes, which takes place prior to a disaster.Research Design and MethodsThis study engaged year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 older individuals of 60–90 years of age. Transcripts were analyzed by qualitative content analysis integrating both inductive and deductive coding approaches.ResultsOlder respondents overwhelmingly practiced survival preparedness by only storing water and food supplies, but lacked efforts in planning and structural preparedness due to insufficient awareness and financial resources. Most respondents asserted hurricane readiness despite the shortage of preparation practices because “being prepared” is defined differently for different individuals. Many respondents claimed hurricane experience and subjective interpretation rather than objective nature of prior exposure appeared to have a greater influence over respondents’ reported preparedness behavior.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study adds to the emerging, but highly limited body of work specifically addressing disaster preparedness among older adults. The interview data inclusive of respondents’ voices and values suggest that expectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. More practical and age-specific interventions are needed to promote disaster preparedness of older adults.

Guided by the ecological extension of the Pearlin’s Stress Process Model, this study explores the rural and urban differences in neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms among older adults in China.Research Design and MethodsData came from two waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative survey. The study included 6,548 older adults ages 60 and above in 2011, with follow-up in 2013. Predictors (individual and neighborhood characteristics) were drawn from the 2011 baseline, and outcome, depressive symptoms, was extracted from the 2013 wave.ResultsMultilevel modeling results showed that after controlling for depressive symptoms at the baseline, symptoms decreased in neighborhoods where physical environment and social environment were better. Among rural respondents, neighborhood stressors stemmed mainly from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, the stressors came from the social environment.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study demonstrated and discussed the role that neighborhoods may play in reducing depressive symptoms in later life. Community organizers and policy makers are encouraged to ameliorate community environments to improve mental health among older adults in China.

A deeper understanding of factors contributing to social isolation can allow policymakers and health care providers to create policies and programs to alleviate the social isolation of these vulnerable and understudied individuals.Research Design and MethodsParticipants were recruited through the support of the Housing Authority and Police and Fire Departments of Richmond, California, a town with a high-crime rate. Fifty-nine ethnographic interviews were conducted with 20 individuals of 58–95 years of age. Transcripts and fieldnotes were analyzed with a focus on the specific factors contributing the social isolation of participants.ResultsAn overarching theme of tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerged from qualitative content analysis. A tension emerged between a longing to participate in society and the immersion in a reality so dense with obstacles that made participation in society difficult to attain. Four specific themes also emerged. Three themes demonstrated underlying factors of social isolation stemming from the personal sphere and the physical and social environment. The fourth theme illustrated participants’ desire for social integration.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings demonstrate the salience of interventions and programs to make neighborhoods safe and accessible to older residents. Findings also suggest a need to reframe the conceptual framework for social isolation to better measure and alleviate this public health problem.

The interwoven and complex nature of person and place points to methods that can examine these relationships in situ and explore meanings attached to places. Participatory geospatial methods can capture situated details about place that are not verbalized during interviews or otherwise discerned, and qualitative methods can explore interpretations, both helping to generate deep understandings of the relationships between person and place. This article describes a combined qualitative-geospatial approach for studying of older adults in neighborhoods and investigates the qualitative-geospatial approach developed, including its utility and feasibility in exploring person–place transactions in neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsWe developed and implemented a qualitative-geospatial approach to explore how neighborhood and person transact to shape sense of social connectedness in older adults. Methods included narrative interviews, go-along interviews, and global positioning system tracking with activity/travel diary completion followed by map-based interviews. We used a variety of data analysis methods with attention to fully utilizing diverse forms of data and integrating data during analysis. We reflected on and examined the utility and feasibility of the approach through a variety of methods.ResultsFindings indicate the unique understandings that each method contributes, the strengths of the overall approach, and the feasibility of implementing the approach. Discussion and ImplicationsThe developed approach has strong potential to generate knowledge about person–place transactions that can inform practice, planning, policy, and research to promote older adults’ well-being.

In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults’ perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics.Design and MethodsAssociations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the “Senioren Barometer.” Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF.ResultsSeven scales (comprising 3–9 items) of environment were constructed—housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental.ImplicationsThis study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance.

Policymakers increasingly recognize that “successful” aging policies must not only address physical health needs but also factors that influence subjective well-being.Design and MethodsTo investigate the influence of area-level distribution of “public goods” on well-being in a low- and middle-income setting, nationally representative WHO-Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey data is combined with district-level data that captures built resources and health system distribution. Multilevel regression modeling is utilized to explore how community context, including built resources and health infrastructure quality, influence older persons’ quality of life and how chronic health conditions may moderate this relationship while controlling for important individual characteristics.ResultsWhile controlling for individual and district level factors, it is found community level provision of built resources of basic services (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity, housing) has a modest but significant impact on older persons’ subjective well-being. Further, this effect on older persons’ perceptions of quality of life is moderated by individual chronic health status; individuals with a chronic health condition do not receive an equivalent benefit from district built condition like those without an illness do.ImplicationsThis work adds to the literature concerning the effect of environments in low- and middle-income countries on older adults’ subjective well-being. It also adds to the growing literature on the complex relationship between subjective well-being and health in diverse contexts.

Participants (N = 454) reported weekly frequency of WT and WR at baseline (2003–2004) and follow-up (2007–2008). Attributes of local destinations and routes were based on self-reported measures at baseline and included: proximity to utilitarian and recreational destinations, the number of such destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, street connectivity, and walking paths. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the associations of perceived destination and route attributes with changes in frequency of WT and WR.ResultsHigher levels of perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations, reporting a larger number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home and higher street connectivity were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WT. Higher levels of perceived proximity to recreational destinations and better walking paths were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WR. No curvilinear relationships were observed and baseline frequency of walking did not moderate the associations.Discussion and ImplicationsProximity of utilitarian and recreational destinations, well-connected streets, and better walking paths can be supportive of long-term participation in walking among middle-to-older aged adults. Environmental and policy initiatives focusing on such destination and route attributes have the potential to support residents’ aging in place.

Why do some older adults withdraw from the public, and which role does the (urban) environment play in spatial (dis-)engagement? Environmental gerontology’s model of person–environment (PE) fit suggests an interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity and wellbeing in later life. However, there is little research on how these dimensions are actually related. This study sets out to investigate this relationship and how PE can be better adapted for deprived neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsThe study follows a qualitative case studies approach, focusing on a deprived neighborhood in Vienna, Austria. Nonparticipant observations were conducted at this site and complemented by 13 episodic interviews with older residents.ResultsThe results challenge PE’s model of interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity, wellbeing, and autonomy in later life. Spatial agency in the deprived neighborhood was intense but so was spatial alienation and distancing oneself from one’s neighborhood. Drawing on notions of territorial stigma, this might be a coping strategy to prevent one’s self-identity from being “stained”. Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space.Discussion and ImplicationsPE can be complemented with intersubjective measures of environmental conditions (e.g., stigma) and spatial engagement. Gerontology should proceed to consider not only the poor, disadvantaged, disengaged elderly, but also the rebellious, resisting, provocative new generation of older adults.

A community-based participatory action research project conducted in Western Canada examined how to best use the shared amenity spaces in a low-income seniors’ apartment complex in order to connect services and programs with tenants and to provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and create new relationships toward collaboration and service delivery.Design and MethodsPre-move deliberative dialogue workshops (n = 4) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees). Workshop participants (n = 24) generated ideas and plans on how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants.ResultsShared dialogue led to community investment and asset sharing by integrating the knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. This article highlights how collaborative planning approaches for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming), within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and community spaces), can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors. Contextual challenges to service provision are discussed, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive programming, and long-term funding.ImplicationsProlonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults.

Nonetheless, to date, there has been limited research on everyday activities of urban older adults in public open spaces. The present study examined the activities of older adults in public open spaces in Israel with a specific focus on age and gender as potential variables of relevance.Research Design and MethodsUsing still photography, we systematically photographed four sessions in two different public outdoor settings attended by older Israelis. Still photographs were converted to narrative descriptions, and then coded, quantified, and compared using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe majority (311, 97%) of older adults arrived alone to the public setting. Of these, 44% formed a social group of two or more people, whereas the remaining older adults stayed alone. When social interactions occurred, they were primarily gender homogenous (69%); women were more likely to integrate in spontaneous social conversations and men were more likely to participate in common games.Discussions and ImplicationsOur findings call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities among older adults. The findings further stress the high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults, which do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance of public spaces.

By investigating both neighborhood and home as the sociospatial realms of older adults, we explore associations between health and place across multiple contexts. We also distinguish objective and subjective measures of place and disentangle their differential associations with cognition.Research Design and MethodsWe analyzed place effects on cognition from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 2,260) linked to neighborhood characteristics and crime data. We measured place in four ways: (a) objective indicators of neighborhood such as police-reported crime rates and interviewer-reported on presence of disordered conditions on the streets; (b) perceptions of neighborhood by respondents (perceived danger and social cohesion); (c) objective conditions of home (interviewer’s report on presence of clutters, odor, and messiness); (4) perceived social support, strain, and threat by household members. The MoCA-SA was used to assess cognitive functioning.ResultsSubjective interpretations appeared to have more direct effects on cognition than did objective indicators of neighborhood or home. When examining these living environments together, we found the association between neighborhood and cognition is partially explained by characteristics of home environment, especially perceived social support. We found a buffering effect of social support on cognition for women, not for men.Discussion and ImplicationsLate life living environments are important contexts for aging. Aging-in-Place interventions should address subjective interpretations of place to reduce future risks of cognitive decline.

We examine whether disordered neighborhoods are a key contextual determinant of sleep problems in late life, as well as how subjective social power—a sense of personal control and subjective social status—mediates and moderates this association. Central to this contribution is the use of econometric techniques that holistically control for time-stable factors that may bias estimated associations.Research Design and MethodsThree waves (2006, 2010, 2014) of the psychosocial subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,130) are analyzed with random-effects models that adjust for repeated observations, as well as fixed-effects models that additionally control for all time-stable confounders.ResultsNeighborhood disorder is associated with greater sleep problems in random-effects models, but this association is substantially weakened in a fixed-effects model. Personal control mediates this association, but does not moderate it. Subjective social status does not mediate the association, but does moderate it.Discussion and ImplicationsAlthough neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in older adults, this association is likely to be overestimated in analyses that do not compressively control for time-stable confounders. Rather than acting as dual mediators and moderators, perceived control and subjective social status play distinct roles in this association, with seniors at lower levels of subjective social status especially at risk for sleep problems due to neighborhood disorder.

Measures of environmental disorder were conducted by trained interviewers. Survey data were also linked to census tract information from the 2009 American Community Survey. We used actor–partner interdependence models to estimate the likelihood of reporting low sexual interest.ResultsThere was no observed association between neighborhood context (physical disorder or census tract socioeconomic disadvantage) and sexual interest, but husbands were more likely to report low sexual interest if they lived in more disorderly households. High marital quality protected against low sexual interest, but these evaluations did not mediate or moderate the putative effect of household disorder.Discussion and ImplicationsRegardless of the broader neighborhood context, helping older adults maintain an orderly home space may help sustain sexual functioning. Future research should consider how various features of the environment matter for additional aspects of late-life sexuality.

      "[Aging occurs in context. People age within their families, within their homes, within their neighborhoods, and within their societies. Too often, however, characteristics external to individuals are relegated to unexplained variance—the error—of health outcomes. With this Special Issue, The Gerontologist highlights the roles played by the physical and social environments in which people live, directly addressing whether and how neighborhoods affect the way we age. These 18 articles move the field forward conceptually and methodologically. They identify dimensions of neighborhoods that are important to health as well as those that are not, suggest ways to measure neighborhoods, demonstrate how to include elements of neighborhood into sophisticated qualitative and quantitative analyses, and offer information about where interventions are most likely to be effective.The Special Issue articles offer compelling evidence that neighborhoods shape a multitude of health outcomes, including subjective ratings of health and aging (; ; ; ; ), depression and psychological well-being (, ), social isolation (), person-place transactions (), and quality of life (; ). The articles also show that neighborhood characteristics have an effect on behaviors, including walking for transport and recreation (), use of public space (; ; ), cognition (), sleep (), and sex ().What is it about neighborhoods that mold the way we age? The Special Issue shows that neighborhood effects are diverse, and include the socioeconomic status of a community (), presence of older people (), crime (), physical disorder (; ; ; ), presence of local shops and services (), community resources including water, sanitation, and electricity (), and social cohesion (; ). Even the amount of sun and shade are important indicators of how neighborhoods can influence behavior ().  finds that it is the combination of lack of health services and commercial decline that has the most meaningful impact on health and that neighborhood characteristics have little effect in the short-term, but powerful effects when they are cumulative.It is clear from the Special Issue articles that neighborhood effects are complex, that they affect some people more than others, and that they affect people in different ways.  explores how the intersection of global and local trends relating to population aging and rural change create contested spaces for rural aging, while  examines why some older people withdraw from public spaces and how the urban environment affects this spatial disengagement.  show that, among rural residents of China, neighborhood stressors stem from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, stressors derive from the social environment. Similarly,  find that the effect of perceived neighborhood safety is greater among older adults with functional limitations than among those without these limitations and that perceived social cohesion is only related to psychological health among people with functional limitations.  report that economically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods have higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods and that both economically vulnerable and high-income adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods suffer more depression and anxiety than those living in more affluent areas.Studying neighborhoods requires creativity, and the papers in this Special Issue display an impressive array of innovative methods for measuring the phenomena they seek to understand.  use visual research methods—still photography—to represent what a neighborhood looks like.  use a combination of narrative interviews, go-along interviews, global positioning system tracking, and activity/travel diaries, to develop and implement a qualitative-geospatial approach to exploring how neighborhood and person transact to shape social connectedness.  use community-based participatory action research to learn how to use shared amenity spaces in order to connect services and programs with tenants and provide opportunities for service providers to deliver services.  use geography-based analyses, demonstrating that compared to districts with an average rate of population aging, persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate hold more negative perceptions of aging and districts with slow population aging have significantly better perceptions of aging. Administrative data—data such as that collected by the U.S. Census—used by  is common, yet fraught with a host of methodological challenges that researchers must confront. Although self-perceptions (; ), interviewer-rated assessments (; ), and ethnographic interviews () are not novel methods, when used to understand neighborhoods, they raise new issues that researchers must address. As  demonstrate, understanding the perceptions that older people have of their environment requires a multifactorial measure.Analytically, studying neighborhoods is challenging because we cannot randomly assign people to live in a neighborhood. Rather, people move to places where people like them live, creating questions about whether findings are the result of individual or neighborhood-level variables. The nesting of people within neighborhoods is typically addressed using strategies that account for individual characteristics. , for example, find that neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in random effects models, but that the association is weakened in fixed effects model that control for age, education, sex, race, and marital status.  find that after controlling for depression at baseline, symptoms decrease in neighborhoods where physical and social environments are better. From a qualitative perspective,  demonstrate the unique understanding that different methods of data collection bring to our understanding of place.  identify an overarching theme of tension between person and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerging from qualitative content analysis. They find that, although people express a longing to participate in society, their immersion in a reality dense with obstacles can make this desire difficult to attain.Several articles in the Special Issue make use of neighborhood data collected by large, representative panels, highlighting the rich opportunity these data sets have for increasing knowledge about the ways in which neighborhoods affect aging. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP; ; ), National Health & Aging Trends Study (NHATS; ), Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; ), California Health Interview Survey (CHIS; ; ), China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; ), German Aging Survey (DEAS; ), WHO Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE; ), and Health & Retirement Study (HRS; ) have self-report and interviewer ratings of neighborhoods. When these data are merged with administrative datasets, the potential to learn how neighborhoods affect aging is tremendous.Understanding neighborhoods is important because they are places for optimizing interventions.  find that shared amenity spaces can be used to connect services and programs with tenants.  call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities, yet caution that high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance in public spaces.  show the negative effects that neighborhood gentrification can have on older people, suggesting that aging in place may have its drawbacks.These studies demonstrate that where we live and age matters for how we live and age. Collectively, they begin rather than end a set of important conversations. Questions about whether objective or subjective aspects of neighborhood have stronger influences on aging outcomes remain. We do not yet know what physical space—the block on which a person lives, their neighborhood, or their community—most affects outcomes since much of what we know about “neighborhoods” is based on administrative data as determined by Census tracts. In this vein, we need better understanding of how older people define their neighborhoods. We need more research about diverse aspects of contexts, including the built environment (e.g., access to health care, proximity to services), the natural environment (e.g., nearness of parks, presence of sidewalks, exposure to pollutants), the food environment (e.g., proximity to fast foods, supermarkets, availability of fresh produce), and the psychosocial environment (e.g., social cohesion; neighborhood safety; and opportunities to engage in meaningful activities, to contribute, to learn new skills, and to exercise existing skills).Moving forward in our understanding about neighborhoods requires efforts from disciplines that include psychology, sociology, geography, anthropology, economics, medicine, social work, law, and the humanities. Developments that are conceptually driven and methodologically rigorous will lead to interventions that will better the lives of older people and strengthen the places in which we all live. References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesGrowing literature documents that where you live has an impact on your health, due in part to social capital. Building on social capital literature, we assess how subjective appraisals of neighborhood quality are associated with self-reported health (SRH) for older adults.Research Design and MethodsCross-sectional analysis of the 2014 California Health Interview Survey, a representative survey of diverse, noninstitutionalized California residents. We use three measures of neighborhood quality: trustworthy neighbors, helpful neighbors, and feeling safe. Using weighted ordinary least squares regression, we assess the associations of trust, helpfulness, and safety to SRH, controlling for neighborhood, demographic, and health care variables. We then examine how these associations vary by household income.ResultsWe find that characterizing neighbors as helpful and feeling safe are associated with better SRH, even controlling for community, demographic, and health care variables. However, the importance of these dimensions varies across household income: helpfulness is positively associated, whereas trust is negatively associated with SRH for lower income residents; safety is positively associated with SRH in all but the lowest income residents. These findings show that social capital dimensions work differently from one another, and differentially affect the health of older adults.Discussion and ImplicationsScholarly analyses of neighborhood effects should include a range of social capital measures and stratify by household income. Our findings may also inform priority setting for social capital programs, especially for older adults with limited economic resources. Policies and programs should consider actions that raise perceptions of helpfulness and safety. , , , , Neighborhood contexts matter for the health of residents. This is especially true for older adults, for whom physical and social engagement may be limited by increased disability and need for supports (). As adults age, they spend more time in their own communities with geographically smaller social networks (; ). Older adults are especially susceptible to structural problems in the neighborhood—such as lack of sidewalks, uneven surfaces, and traffic—because of limited mobility (; ). The quality of neighborhoods varies across contexts, affecting older adults’ health.Social cohesion, a component of social capital, also varies across neighborhoods (; ). There are various definitions of “social capital” (see for example ; ; ), but it is most commonly conceptualized as a resource stemming from group membership that exists at psychological, individual, meso-, and macro-levels, including social relationships that are beneficial to individuals and communities (). There is a long history of research showing that higher social capital improves health, above and beyond individual-level characteristics (; ). Research on social capital and health takes various forms. In some studies, the term is used to mean the quantity and quality of social relationships and is often measured through social networks (; ). In other studies, it is used to signify cognitive evaluations of the group, such as shared values and trust (; ).By combining findings from both approaches, some questions emerge about social capital and health of older adults. For example, we often assume that older adults become more socially isolated as they age, but studies have shown a complex dynamic. Although older age is associated with smaller network size and connections that are less close, older adults also report more frequent socializing and community engagement than their younger adult peers (). These forms of social engagement likely improve the health of older adults; however, more research is needed to understand how social capital works independently of simple social engagement for older adults’ health. In this study, we conceptualize social capital as a community-level resource; analyze three different dimensions of social capital; and focus on how these dimensions of social capital may affect older adults differently, based on their economic resources. BackgroundNeighborhood factors affect a variety of health outcomes. In terms of mortality, a meta-analysis of neighborhood effects concluded that the socioeconomic status of neighborhoods and social cohesion affected mortality such that people living in poorer areas and without social cohesion had the highest rates of mortality (). Physical functioning for older adults is also affected by neighborhood contexts. One study found that older adults who identified problems in their neighborhood were more than twice as likely as those without problems in the neighborhood to have losses in functional ability (). These findings also hold for mental health. A study of 60 communities across the United States found that social support and safety from violence were protective against mental health disorders and substance abuse ().In this study, we use self-reported health (SRH) to understand the importance of social capital for older adults. SRH has been used in previous studies of community context and health of older adults (; ) and serves as a global measure of health that captures functional, physical, and psychosocial factors that affect quality of life (). This measure has also been shown to be valid across racial and ethnic groups, making it especially useful for our study of diverse Californians (; ). Finally, SRH is predictive of mortality, decline, and health care utilization ().Residents’ perceptions of neighborhood quality reflect community social capital. The quality of neighborhoods is assessed through subjective measures such as quality of relationships among neighbors or feelings of trust. Our approach builds on recent scholarship that seeks to evaluate subjective assessments of neighborhoods (; ; ). For example,  examined neighborhood affluence and disadvantage alongside community members’ overall satisfaction, evaluation of neighborhood upkeep, and safety. They find that subjective appraisals of the community were more strongly associated with adult health than objective features. , studying older adults in Cook County, Illinois, come to similar conclusions, suggesting that subjective evaluations of neighborhoods matter a great deal.There are several possible mechanisms linking subjective assessments of neighborhood quality and SRH. First, feeling like neighbors are helpful, trustworthy, and that the neighborhood is safe may encourage physical activity (), which then is associated with better physical and mental health (; ).  found that older adults who lived in neighborhoods that were safe and encouraged social interaction walked for greater lengths of time than those living in less social environments. Second, more cohesive neighborhoods may encourage more social interaction and community engagement (), which then improves physical and mental health. Third, social cohesion may also indicate that residents feel supported by a community-level culture that is helpful, productive, and protective against crime, which improves overall well-being (), as well as mental health among older adults ().It is likely that social capital resources work differently for individuals living in different economic conditions. Inequality in access to economic resources is a fundamental cause of health disparities (). In addition to providing access to care, economic conditions shape the kinds of social interactions that take place within neighborhoods.  found that older adults living in more affluent neighborhoods had more social interaction than those living in poorer areas. Neighborhood socioeconomic status is also associated with psychological health: residents of lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods have poorer psychological health, even controlling for individual differences ().  found that neighborhood poverty affected a range of social processes, including trust, safety, helpfulness, but also racism, disorder, fear, victimization, and dissatisfaction with police. In sum, economic conditions shape how much social capital is available, if and how older adults use it, and how it then affects health.In this study, we assess how community social capital, as measured through subjective assessments of neighborhood quality, is associated with SRH for a diverse sample of Californians, aged 65 or older. Specifically, we analyze residents’ assessments of their neighbors as helpful and trustworthy, and their neighborhood as safe. We ask: How are these dimensions of social capital associated with SRH of older adults? Do these social capital dimensions have an association independent from typical social determinants of health factors, such as community, demographic, or health care variables? Do the associations of social capital on SRH vary by residents’ economic resources? We expect that social capital will be positively associated with SRH. We also expect that these positive associations will remain statistically significant, even when typical social determinants of health controls are added. However, we expect that how these social capital variables work is conditional on the economic resources of residents. Data and MethodsDataWe use data from the public use files of the 2014 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), administered by UCLA’s Center for Health Policy Research (). CHIS is an ongoing cross-sectional survey of California residents, sampled through a multistage design. It is administered by phone, including cell phone and landline numbers and is representative of noninstitutionalized people living in California.Phone numbers were randomly selected within strata representing different counties in California. In order to represent the diverse population of Californians, CHIS oversamples several smaller racial and ethnic groups. Surveys were conducted in seven different languages/dialects: English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. We have used CHIS survey weights to represent the noninstitutionalized population. These weights account for differential probability of selection and reduce nonresponse biases. We limit our analyses to respondents aged 65 or older, resulting in a sample size of 8,256. Demographic data on respondents are shown in . Table 1.Weighted Descriptive Statistics for Adults Aged 65 or Older—California Health Interview Survey 2014 (n = 8,256) Note: n = 8,256, weighted to adjust sample to population distribution. Population = 4,834,175. HS = high school. Key Dependent and Independent VariablesOur dependent variable, SRH, is a measure of general health condition and respondents were instructed to select between Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor. For our analysis, we have reverse coded the responses such that Excellent equals 5 and Poor equals 1.Our key independent variables are subjective ratings of neighborhood quality. We use three variables, each scored with Likert-type responses: “People in my neighborhood are willing to help each other,” “People in this neighborhood can be trusted,” (strongly agree [4] to strongly disagree [1]) and “Do you feel safe in your neighborhood?” (all of the time [4] to none of the time [1]). In the second set of analyses, we use household income as a percent of the federal poverty threshold as an additional key independent variable. We have created four groupings according to the cut-points for the  assistance eligibility. Because people aged 65 and older receive Medicare, the ACA eligibility does not affect their access to health insurance. However, the ACA eligibility variable creates roughly equal groupings based on differences in access to economic resources. A value of “1” indicates that the household is between 0 and 138% of the federal poverty threshold, “2” indicates 139–249%; “3” indicates 250–399%, and “4” indicates 400% and higher. Control VariablesWe measure several aspects of community life that are separate from subjective evaluations of neighborhood. First, we include variables for two types of social action that have been associated with health outcomes: volunteerism and community engagement (). Controlling for these factors allows us to evaluate if subjective appraisals of the neighborhood have an effect beyond community involvement. We also include housing measures such as multiunit (apartment, condo, etc.) living and home ownership. Home ownership, in particular, has been associated with more active community investment and is an indicator of assets that are health protective (; ). In addition, we include a series of dichotomous variables for type of area using the rural-urban coding at the U.S. Census block as classified by Claritas (). Because of the documented challenges receiving health care in rural areas (; ), we use rural as the reference group in regression analyses.Demographic factors also affect SRH. We include controls for sex, race/ethnicity, education, age group, and married/cohabitating. Race and ethnicity come from a survey question asking respondents to pick the race or ethnicity with which they most identify. We chose this variable for race and ethnicity in order to focus on respondents’ own experience of race and ethnicity. It is important to note that some respondents may fall into more than one category, but were asked to pick only one. We have completed all analyses using alternative variables for race and ethnicity and have found substantively identical results. Responses included Latino (any race), American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, African American, white, and other single/multiple race. Because of small sample sizes of some racial and ethnic groups, we combine into five categories: Latino (any race), African American, Asian, white, and other/multiple. Our categorical measures of education include no high school diploma to graduate or professional degree. We have dichotomized each of these and compare them to no high school diploma in the regression analysis. Our demographic variables also include a dichotomous measure for respondents who are aged 85 or older. Extant literature shows that this age group constitutes the “oldest old” and may have different strengths and challenges than those aged 65–84 (). We also include a measure for married/cohabitating, which captures a potential form of support or informal caregiving responsibility.Our final set of variables control for health conditions and health care access. We include a dichotomized composite variable for disability status that include blindness, deafness, cognitive difficulties, limits to physical activity, need for assistance with activities of daily living, and difficulty going outside the home alone. Existence of any of these disabilities was coded as 1. We include measures for health insurance status, including no insurance, Medicare plus other insurance, Medicare only, and dual insurance from Medicare and Medicaid. As a proxy for acuity of health conditions, we include a count of visits to the doctor in the previous 12 months. We also include a measure of serious psychological distress, using the Kessler 6 scale, dichotomized at 12 or above as indicating serious distress (). Statistical ModelsWe use weighted ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to examine associations between our key independent variables, control variables, and SRH. We first present a model that includes only the measures for helpfulness, trust, and safety. Our second model includes these as well as other community-related variables. Our third model includes key independent variables, community variables, and demographic variables. The fourth model includes all of the above as well as health care controls.Additionally, we ask how these associations vary by the economic condition of residents. Because we expected that the direction, strength, and slope of the independent variables may all vary across social class groupings, we performed separate weighted OLS regressions for each of the groups. We also performed several sensitivity analyses to determine if multilevel modeling would be more appropriate for our data and the extent to which variables interacted with one another (available in online ). ResultsOur dependent variable for this analysis, SRH, ranges from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) and has a mean value of 3.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.12–3.25). Over 70% of the older adults in this sample rate their own general health condition as good, very good, or excellent. Our key independent variables are measured on a four-point Likert-type scale. The mean for helpfulness of neighbors is 3.17 (95% CI = 3.13–3.20) and 90% of the sample said they agreed or strongly agreed that “people in my neighborhood are willing to help each other.” The mean for trust is 3.13 (95% CI = 3.10–3.16) and 91% of the sample agreed or strongly agreed that “people in my neighborhood can be trusted.” Finally, the mean for safety is 3.51 (95% CI = 3.47–3.55) and 93% of the sample reported feeling safe in the neighborhood most or all of the time. These descriptive findings indicate that the majority of older adults in this sample positively evaluate their own health as well as the quality of their neighborhoods. Neighborhood Quality and HealthOur first research question concerned how social capital—measured through subjective neighborhood quality—is associated with SRH for older adults. In the first analysis, we have used stepped regression models to examine how residents’ assessments of neighborhood quality compare to other variables typically associated with SRH. In Model 1 (), we have only included the key independent variables of helpfulness, trust, and safety. We find that characterizing neighbors as more helpful and feeling more safe are both associated with an increase in SRH (B =.26, p ≤ .001 for both). Characterizing neighbors as more trustworthy does not have a statistically significant association with SRH. Table 2.Self-Reported Health Regressed on Neighborhood Quality, Community, Demographics, and Health Care, Adults Aged 65 or Older—California Health Interview Survey 2014 Note: HS = high school diploma; SE = standard error.*Statistical significance at .05 level. **Statistical significance at .01 level. ***Statistical significance at or below .001 level.Our second research question asked if the associations of social capital with SRH would be sustained when variables for community characteristics, demographics of respondents, and health care were added. Model 2 includes our key independent variables as well as variables associated with community involvement and neighborhood characteristics. In this model, higher helpfulness (B = .19, p ≤ .001) and safety (B = .23, p ≤ .001) continue to have statistically significant positive associations to SRH. The coefficients drop slightly once community variables are added. Controls for community indicate that volunteering, living in a multiunit home, and owning a home are also all positively associated with SRH. None of the variables for suburbs, second city, or urban are statistically significant (reference = rural).Demographic controls permit analysis of subjective assessment of neighborhoods independent of the characteristics of respondents. In Model 3, helpfulness (B = .11, p = .02) and safety (B = .21, p ≤ .001) continue to be positively associated with SRH, with additional slight drops when demographic variables are added. Female is positively associated with SRH. None of the race and ethnicity variables are statistically significant. Each level of education is positively associated with SRH. The controls for oldest old and married/cohabitating are not statistically significant. In this model, we also include household income as a proportion of the federal poverty level; it is statistically significant and positively associated with health (B = .20, p ≤ .001).Model 4 includes all previous variables in addition to the controls related to health care. Helpfulness and safety continue to have positive associations to SRH, even controlling for all other variables. In this model, Latino and Asian are both associated with sizeable reductions in SRH, as compared to whites. Disability status, number of doctor visits, and serious psychological distress are all negatively associated with SRH.As expected, helpfulness and safety remained positively associated with SRH, even when controlling for community, demographic, and health care variables. Contrary to our expectations, trust in neighbors was not significant in any of these models. Differences by Household Economic ResourcesOur final research question asked whether social capital associations to SRH varied by resident’s household economic resources. We split our sample of older adults into four categories, based on the household’s percent of the federal poverty threshold. Because splitting the sample reduced the total sample size for each group, we report results using a lower statistical significance cutoff than in the first set of analyses.  reports on these results. Table 3.Self-Reported Health Regressed on Neighborhood Quality, Community, Demographics, and Health Care, By Household Percent Poverty Threshold, Adults Aged 65 or Older—California Health Interview Survey 2014 Note: Because of the smaller sample sizes for these analyses, we have adjusted our statistical significance cutoff to .10. HS = high school diploma; SE = standard error.+Statistical significance at .10 level. *Statistical significance at .05 level. **Statistical significance at .01 level. ***Statistical significance at or below .001 level.For people living in households with less than or equal to 138% of the federal poverty threshold (Model 5), characterizing neighbors as helpful was positively associated with SRH (B = .15, p = .08). Helpfulness is also positively associated with SRH in Model 6, which represents households at 139–249% FPT. Meanwhile, characterizing neighbors as trustworthy was negatively associated with SRH (B = −.21, p = .07) in Model 6. Additionally, for residents at 139–250% FPL, feeling safe was positively associated with SRH (B = .15, p = .06).The control variables in Models 5 and 6 vary slightly from the full sample models. The only community variable that is significant is home ownership. Latino and African American are not significant in Model 5, but are negatively associated with SRH in Model 6; Asian and other/multiple are both negatively associated with SRH in both models. Disability status, number of visits to the doctor, and serious distress (Model 6) are negatively associated with SRH, though the strengths of those coefficients vary.As resident’s household incomes increase, the social capital variable associations to SRH shift. Models 7 (250–399% FPT) and 8 (400% FPT or higher) show that only feeling safe is statistically significant for residents with higher incomes (B = .13, p = .06 in Model 7 and B = .20, p ≤ .001 in Model 8) and is positively associated with SRH. Although residents with lower household incomes benefitted from traditional social capital indicators, such as helpful neighbors, residents with more economic resources only benefitted from feeling safe.Analysis of control variables for Models 7 and 8 shows that volunteering is positively associated with SRH for higher income residents, though not for lower income residents. In these models, Latino, African American, Asian, and other/multiple are less consistently negatively associated with SRH. Even given some of the protections that may come from high income, older adults’ disability status, number of visits to the doctor, and serious psychological distress (Model 7 only) have negative associations with SRH. In line with our expectations, social capital variables’ associations to SRH were contingent on residents’ household income. See  for a graphical display of findings.

Discussion and Con‑clusionNumerous studies have linked social capital to health, concluding that social cohesion and relationships are routes through which individuals take on healthful patterns of behavior and provide support throughout the community (; ). Although this research has grown substantially over time, the concept of the neighborhood has been difficult to integrate. Social capital at the neighborhood-level appears to be more than just the sum of the social capital of residents (; ; ). The question of how neighborhood social capital works is especially important for older adults, for whom social support networks become smaller and more geographically based as they age (; ; ).In this paper, we examined subjective neighborhood assessments—as indicators of neighborhood-level social capital—and their effect on SRH for older adults. We found that assessing neighbors as helpful and the neighborhood as safe were strongly and positively associated with SRH for Californians, aged 65 or older. We expected that social capital may work differently across economic conditions of older adults’ lives. Our second set of models split the sample by household income, finding that older adults living in poorer households benefitted from seeing neighbors as helpful, but seeing neighbors as trustworthy was negatively associated with SRH for some. Furthermore, older adults living in higher income households only benefitted from feeling safe in their neighborhood.These findings enrich theories of social capital and health of older adults in two ways. First, our subjective neighborhood variables illustrate one option for conceptualizing the neighborhood in social capital research. Previous literature has focused on helpfulness and trust, but usually does not also include safety (; ). Our second contribution is to show how social capital works differently across economic resources of residents. Our findings show that some of the assumptions about social capital are more relevant for older adults with higher household incomes than those with lower household incomes, and some dimensions of social capital work differently than expected. More discussion of our three social capital variables and household income follows.Implicit to definitions of social capital is the sense that social relationships provide support as well as instrumental help. We find that characterizing neighbors as helpful was associated with SRH, but not for all older adults. Additionally, the coefficient for helpfulness is partially reduced by the inclusion of demographic factors. Qualitative research provides some explanations for both findings. , in a comparative ethnography of community centers for older adults, found that the meaning of helping peers varied across social class and racial/ethnic groups. Although helping a neighbor might be seen as kind in some contexts, it may indicate that the neighbor was perceived as too weak to care for themselves in another context. Despite differing social meanings of help, helpful neighbors may mitigate problems stemming from poor economic conditions and deprivation (), which could explain the positive association with help and SRH for only the lower income groups. It is also possible that higher income older adults are able to hire out help and do not rely on neighbors as much as lower income older adults.Trust is a central concept in theories of social capital. Contrary to previous research (; ), we find that trust of neighbors was not statistically significant for the full sample and negatively associated with SRH for residents just above the federal poverty threshold. The counterintuitive finding for trust requires additional research. It is possible that older adults with high degrees of trust are more likely to be victimized (). This may be especially true in poorer neighborhoods where residents may not have economic resources to buffer against victimization. It is also possible that trusting older adults in poorer neighborhoods take on more reciprocal caregiving activities (), which then creates a health burden on themselves (). This finding could also be the result of reverse causality in that poor health may be related to experiences where residents rely on neighbors and come to trust them more.Our third social capital variable of interest was the characterization of the neighborhood as safe. We find that all groups, except the lowest income group, have positive associations between safety and SRH. However, the coefficient for safety was partially reduced by adding health care controls. It is likely that the inclusion of disability status affected the coefficient for safety. As needs for physical assistance increase, hazards of the neighborhood change and heighten (; ). An uneven sidewalk may not be noticeable to someone with no need for assistance, but may become dangerous to someone walking with a cane. Likewise, older adults with disabilities may be more susceptible to victimization and crime, potentially making them fearful and avoidant of social interaction. Studies of neighborhoods often include measures of safety; studies using the social capital perspective do not. As research on social capital and older adults continues, adding this dimension may help improve explanations. LimitationsSome limitations of this paper do exist. First, our analysis is cross-sectional, so we cannot determine the causal direction of the associations we have reported. Second, we use SRH as our dependent variable. Although studies have found SRH to be predictive of health outcomes, it is a rough approximation of health status (; ). Third, we use the public use file for CHIS, which does not include a variable for length of time in residence. Adding this variable may have helped to better understand the length of exposure to community conditions. Finally, our variables for race and ethnicity gloss over differences within groups that may be meaningful. We used a variable that asked respondents to select the race or ethnicity with which they most identify, but CHIS includes additional race/ethnicity variables and a great diversity of responses. Because of small sample sizes we could not make full use of this diversity. Policy ImplicationsOur findings have implications for policies to improve neighborhoods for older adults, especially as current policy efforts encourage aging in place (). Examining the role of subjective assessments of neighborhoods on health shows that efforts should focus on improving community mutual help and safety. Trust may be a mechanism to foster these (in some contexts), but it alone is likely not sufficient. Attention to issues of safety is especially important for older adults and may be heightened as people age and their mobility is reduced. Additionally, those most likely to be economically disadvantaged or socially isolated (widowed, without family) most benefit from mutual helping behavior (). Policies that encourage mutual help may build social capital for all in the neighborhood. The focus on helpful behaviors may be especially effective for older adults with limited resources.Community contexts are rich with social processes that affect the lives of older adults. Most of the respondents in our study characterized their neighbors as helpful and trustworthy, and their neighborhoods as safe. Even so, residents who felt less helped or less safe in their neighborhood had poorer SRH. We have shown how these dimensions of social capital and their effects vary for a diverse sample of Californians, aged 65 or older. Future research would benefit from deeper understanding of the neighborhood conditions that produce feelings of helpfulness, trust, and safety, with particular attention to economic variation. This would improve theories of social capital as well as suggest ways to intervene to improve community life for older adults. Supplementary MaterialSupplementary data is available at The Gerontologist online. Conflict of InterestNone reported. References Issue Section:Supplementary data - docx file, AbstractInformed by a critical turn underway in rural gerontology, this article explores how the intersection of global and local trends relating to population aging and rural change create contested spaces of rural aging. The aim is to build our understanding of rural as a dynamic context within which the processes, outcomes, and experiences of aging are created, confronted, and contested by older adults and their communities. A review of key developments within gerontology and rural studies reveals how competing policies, discourses, and practices relating to healthy aging and aging in place, rural citizenship and governmentality, and social inclusion and inequality combine in particular ways to empower or disempower a diverse range of older rural adults aging in a diverse range of rural communities. The article provides a contextually sensitive perspective on potential sources of conflict and exclusion for older adults in dynamic rural spaces and further enhances our understanding of how rural physical and social environments are constructed and experienced in older age. A framework for interrogating emergent questions about aging in rural contexts is developed and implications for advancing research, policy, and practice are discussed. , , , , In examining the global contexts in which people grow older, rural places are assuming greater significance for understanding the processes, outcomes, and representations of aging. Predominantly, this trend is associated with growing global rates of rural population aging, which are anticipated to increase demand on health and social care services in nonmetropolitan regions (). However, there is also consensus that rural environments present different challenges and opportunities to health and wellbeing in later life to those experienced in urban spaces (; ; ). Despite these differences, the rural context remains largely underexamined within gerontological research (). In particular, there is a dearth of critical inquiry that can be partly attributed to common romanticizations of rural areas as “good places to grow old” due to perceived high levels of social capital and support (). In recent decades, work across diverse international contexts has sought to debunk this simplistic notion, with key studies calling for more critical perspectives in researching rural aging (; ; ). The critical lens acknowledges the role of structural changes and constraints on older people’s status and access to resources, and enables exploration of how older adults become disempowered through macro-level social and economic trends (; ; ). It also enables explorations of how older people and their communities experience and transform processes and outcomes of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental change (; ; ). Underlying these explorations is a growing interest in understanding rural as a dynamic context within which experiences and outcomes of aging are created ().With regard to spaces of rural aging, the critical turn has given rise to a body of literature within social and environmental gerontology that draws on human ecology theory. This perspective acknowledges that rural older adults are not only shaped by but also play a significant role in co-constructing their community environments (; ; ). However, there has been little exploration within gerontology of the processes and dynamics underpinning these constructions and experiences of place (,4). Implicit in discussions relating to older people’s access to power and resources within rural settings are the negotiations, conflicts, and contests associated with use, production and occupancy of rural social, built and symbolic spaces, which either facilitate or hinder access (). As  notes, these negotiations over rural space are generated through differing interpretations of the rights and responsibilities associated with being a rural citizen, which is commonly referred to as rural citizenship (). We argue that understanding how the intersection of rural citizenship and population aging creates “contested rural spaces” is fundamental for understanding how diverse rural older adults become empowered or disempowered within certain contexts.Contested spaces encompass “geographical locations where conflicts in the form of opposition, confrontation, subversion and/or resistance engage actors whose social positions are defined by differential control of resources/access to power” (: 18). In many cases, this conflict relates to disputes over rights and access to different spaces, and the future trajectories of these spaces (; ). Given that the literature has simultaneously highlighted issues relating to the contested nature of rural space (e.g., ) and of older age (e.g., ; ), examining how these contested spaces intersect is critical in understanding how older adults can age well (; ). Consequently, our aim in this article is to explore how contested spaces of rural aging are created, and the implications of this for older people and their communities, setting forth a contextually sensitive framework for rural aging research, policy, and practice. In doing so, we seek to contribute simultaneously to a spatial turn underway in social gerontology () as well as a critical turn called for within rural gerontology (). The article begins with an overview of key developments within these fields that inform our approach, before discussing how contested spaces of rural aging are created, what is being contested and the processes and outcomes of contestation for diverse groups. We conclude with a consideration of the implications of contested rural aging spaces for advancing research, policy, and practice. Critical Rural GerontologyAs  noted in their authoritative review of the emerging field of rural gerontology, academic interest in rural as a context of aging is long-standing. This is evident within pioneering studies of the lives of older rural people from the 1960s onward (e.g., ), through to the burgeoning of gerontological interest in the trends, processes, and outcomes of rural demographic change around the world today (). Propelled by the development and application of ecological perspectives within environmental gerontology (; ,; ) and, more recently, spatial perspectives within geographical gerontology (; ), rural has become a focal point for research on aging contexts. Indeed, recent publications in the field argue for greater attention to rural aging studies for their transferable insights into pressing program and policy issues facing contemporary aging societies (e.g., retirement migration, social isolation, and age-friendly communities; e.g., ; ; ). Notwithstanding this intellectual trajectory nor the current global trend in rural population aging; however, rural gerontology is only now being recognized as a coherent field of inquiry.Twenty years ago, in a review of the field that remains prescient today, : 115) observed how “…decades of researching on ageing in rural environments has resulted in limited progress towards developing a distinctive rural gerontology”. Illustrative of broader critiques underway in the social sciences at the time, his review called for greater engagement with post-positivist theorizations of rural contexts of aging (i.e., ecological, sociocultural, and phenomenological) that help account for the diversity and complexity of rural aging processes, outcomes, and experiences. Two decades on, as evident in the program of the first International Conference on Rural Aging () and the international contributions to subsequent special issues and edited collections on rural aging themes (e.g., ; ; ; ; ; ), social gerontologists had begun to address this gap by expanding the theoretical breadth of rural aging research to account for exclusion, identity, and representation, among other identifiers of change and difference. They also continued to strengthen the applied focus of gerontology on the issues facing aging rural populations; namely, population dynamics, service provision, technology, and health policy (). As observed by , however, despite many gerontological studies continuing to view rural as merely a setting for empirical research rather than an ever-changing context that can potentially shape experiences and outcomes for older adults, an increasingly robust body of multidisciplinary rural aging scholarship—if not the foundations of a distinctive rural gerontology—has now emerged.Of particular importance for building our understanding of the contested spaces of rural aging is the influence of two recent developments aimed at addressing the lack of engagement with contextually sensitive and critical perspectives within gerontology more broadly. First, is the spatial turn underway in social gerontology, led by greater engagement with geographical concepts of space and place in the study of older people’s interactions with their environments, communities, and societies (). Work within geographical gerontology is shedding light on how rural aging contexts (spaces, places, environments, landscapes) are produced through the interactions of older people and the settings within which they experience and respond to aging (). The implication for rural gerontology is an increased recognition of the importance of context for understanding older adults’ experiences of the processes and outcomes of aging (). For instance, international studies have highlighted the interdependent relationship between older adults’ voluntarism and rural community sustainability, in that the volunteer contributions of older adults are critical in ensuring that vital community services and supports are available to support aging in place (; ; ). Second, is the over-arching influence of culturally informed critical approaches to aging studies that advocate for increasing attention to the diversity and complexity of aging experiences, and how these are socially constructed (). Work within critical gerontology is illuminating the ways in which gender, sexuality, race, class, and ability relate to processes and outcomes, experiences and representations of aging (). Implications for rural gerontology include the need to understand and challenge the construction (and contestation) of environments of rural aging, and the myths and stereotypes that are associated with prevailing conceptions of aging and rurality. Key studies highlight the increasing diversity of life histories, experiences, and expectations of older adults in rural areas () and how this diversity creates the likelihood that older rural adults will challenge the implicit and explicit rights and responsibilities associated with being a rural citizen (; ; ; ). Taken together, these developments point to the need for better understanding the contested spaces of rural aging as a means of further advancing a theoretically informed and applied “rural turn” in contemporary gerontology advocated for by . Contested Spaces of Rural AgingConsistent with critical human ecological approaches to rural gerontology (), the rural aging literature highlights the importance of interactions across and within different environmental contexts (e.g., household, community, organizational, and policy) in creating contested spaces of rural aging. In aging rural communities, we propose that these conflicts emerge over the negotiation of rural citizenship, which encompasses the “rights and entitlements to the symbolic, geographic and social spaces” that make up rural places (). However, it also reflects the performance of citizen responsibilities to access these rights (), through adherence to both formal and informal codes of conduct relating to the consumption or production of rural space (; ). Our discussion in this section draws on the contemporary rural gerontology literature to articulate the processes and practices that give rise to contested space, and in doing so, identifies five key, interrelated processes and outcomes, which are articulated as follows.1. Contested spaces of rural aging are created as a result of competing policies and practices relating to healthy aging and rural governmentality, and changing rural demographicsObserving the rights and responsibilities associated with rural citizenship are critical to community sustainability in the context of wider rural restructuring () and this is pressing where policies and trends relating to both aging and the rural intersect. In the context of global population aging and its purported economic impact, neoliberal governments are promoting positive aging discourses that emphasize individual responsibility for wellbeing and the right to pursue choice and independence as they age (). This is associated with the reinvention of later life as a time to exercise agency, choice, and consumption (), and to challenge traditional stereotypes of older age as a time of marginalization and decline (). However, this aging discourse will inevitably conflict with prominent implicit and explicit rural codes of conduct (). In the context of decades of rural service restructuring and economic decline, which have severely influenced the sustainability of rural settings, neoliberal governments have drawn on governmentality discourses to rationalize limited rural public expenditure. This approach emphasizes the importance of individual involvement in, and responsibility for, rural community governance in keeping rural communities sustainable. Specifically, it emphasizes the need for rural communities to develop proactive strategies for community development independent of government (), which is “sold” as a right. However, implicit in this discourse is the importance of benevolence and acting for the public good (), which will not necessarily align with individualist approaches to aging nor the capacities of rural older adults to engage in community governance.This contradiction also becomes problematic when considered that rural aging populations are becoming increasingly diverse in response to wider counter-urbanization trends and growing rates of rural retirement migration (; ). In the context of wider aging policies aimed at developing the age-friendliness of community settings (), different life course experiences and relationships with the rural will inevitably result in contestation over what age-friendliness should encompass in a rural setting, and what this entails for rights and responsibilities to rural communities in older age. Within a public policy setting where governments are looking to exclude themselves from the direct provision of health and social care (), and the relative unattractiveness of the rural market for health and social care providers (), conflict will inevitably emerge over who is responsible for the care of older adults in rural settings. The differential rates of population aging in rural settings () and the varied resource base within rural communities () will also influence the importance with which population aging is viewed at the local level, which may prompt disputes over perceived rights and entitlements.Consequently, although macro-level trends create the context for the emergence of rural contested spaces, the actual contestation of these spaces occurs within community and individual environments, and are facilitated by multiple actors. As our subsequent discussion highlights, conflict, and tension emerge within aging rural spaces in relation to two primary issues: rights and responsibilities to rural space in older age; and rights and responsibilities associated with rural aging in place.2. Contested spaces of rural aging emerge over competing discourses over the rights to rural symbolic, political, and cultural space in older ageRural community contexts are significant in shaping the health and wellbeing of older adults (e.g., ; ). However, alongside the many processes of change underway in diverse rural settings, continued population aging in rural areas will prompt increased contestation of the right to diverse rural spaces—symbolically, politically, and culturally. As  note, aging has prompted increased competition for the right to imagine what rural communities should look like; that is, as symbolic spaces of aging. Different cohorts of older adults are actively contesting their right to the rural, by contesting socioeconomic regional and local flows to the countryside, rural development () and threats to environmental sustainability (). Research has noted that the rural imaginary is debated and challenged among older people aging in place, older in-migrants, established rural power elites, and long-term residents in terms of what the rural should look like, how it should be regulated and how it should be used (; ; ).Older people also are active in contesting political space within rural communities, in terms of power to govern and control, or to regulate symbolic space. In Chinese contexts, for example, commentators have noted that local authorities often try to mobilize seniors’ associations because of their political influence, which creates new relations of local power (; ). Similarly, Western research has noted that rural older adults are active in contesting government processes and planning at various levels (; ; ). Older people are often the custodians of long-term rural community groups, which have emerged as highly contested spaces within rural communities in the context of demographic change. Research has noted conflict between the younger-old and older-old in relation to succession planning for rural community groups () as well as resistance among older adults to groups run and managed by well-connected rural power elites ().  have also observed tensions between local organizational management structures and community experts in relation to legitimacy of knowledge about rural aging, with older adults fighting to be heard within debates relating to rural health service delivery ().Within a changing rural demography, the right to a rural place identity in older age also is highly contested. The differing life course trajectories of older people in relation to experience of historical time and place within the rural have created tension in relation to notions of belonging and power (). In particular, increasing levels of rural retirement migration and the emergence of rural locations as spaces of tourism and consumption are producing contested rural space by disturbing established rural social and cultural traditions (). Moreover, the assumption of power by older adults in rural places may challenge existing rural community belief systems, leading to contested cultural spaces of rural aging ().3. Contested spaces of rural aging emerge over competing discourses relating to the right to age in place within rural communitiesThe ability of communities to be age-friendly in the context of rural transformative processes is also highly contested (). At the individual level, the literature has noted tension between the benefits of rural aging in place, such as increased independence, place attachment and community belonging, and the constraints it presents in accessing required services and geographic isolation (; ; ; ). Studies have also identified conflicting notions among older people in relation to how they should be supported as they age. Although rural older adults do not wish to be a burden, they may similarly expect that families and communities should look after them (). Consequently, various actors are contesting the right of rural older adults to age in place, what this should look like and who is responsible.First, many older people are contesting their right to age in place (). As highlighted in the previous point, this contestation is largely played out within civic spaces. In opposition to government predictions relating to the burden that rural population aging will place on the service sector, many older adults are challenging this notion by refusing services (; ). However, they are similarly advocating for the right to access quality services needed to enable aging in place in the context of rural restructuring, and opposing the notion that they should move to access required services (). Across international contexts, older adults are challenging government cuts-backs, hospital closures and health service change in rural areas, the age-friendliness of settings and services (; ), and the advent of virtual spaces of care (). In doing so, they are resisting the provision of substandard health and aged care services, and in an era of personalization are exercising their rights to pursue support that will suit them (), by contesting rural service gaps, unresponsive services, or fragmented care delivery (; ). Within this arena, older people with diverse financial and functional capacities are competing with each other for scarce local resources (), with different groups of older adults having different perspectives on how local governments and communities should allocate resources and amenities (; ). In this context, tension arises between the individual and the state in relation to responsibility for aging in rural communities, in terms of the extent to which the state should extend support to older people who choose to remain in small, service-challenged rural communities (). However, the extent to which aging rurally is a choice is also highly contested, with many older adults unable to relocate as they age (). Consequently, conflict is arising in relation to how older people interact with health and aged care services, and the way these services are planned and managed ().Second, various local actors are challenging policy directives that impact on older adults’ rights to age within their rural communities. Community providers, such as not-for-profit and community groups, are taking action to enable viable aging in place (), with rural community members actively resisting service changes for the sake of older residents (). In particular, the rural voluntary sector plays a role in challenging rural restructuring and the imperative that older adults should move to access services (). In some cases, they are advocating for the rights of older people within the context of rural restructuring; with voluntary not-for-profit organizations resisting structural changes passed down by government, and opposing polices designed to introduce market-oriented competition in rural areas by means of legal challenges and advocacy. In doing so, they are evading the political preference for private not-for-profit by doing whatever is required (). Rural media also plays a key role in initiating this contested space by calling for the defense of community interests in the face of government health system restructuring. They challenge community members to lobby government to protect local interests, give a voice to volunteers and oppose the responsibility of volunteer-based as opposed to formal health care systems ().However, tension is also emerging between local organizations, due to power struggles over responsibility for service provision to rural older adults (; ). In the context of increased devolution of services to the voluntary sector, conflict has arisen between managed competition and voluntary sector capacity in relation to responsibility for long-term care (). Recent research in Australia, for instance, has similarly identified conflicting views between health, government, and community organizations, in terms of their respective responsibility to cater for aging populations, to engage isolated older adults, and to resource age-friendly initiatives (). Within rural organizational spaces, the equitable distribution of resources to aging populations is also contested. Aging may not be a priority for certain organizations and research has noted organizational tensions relating to the ability to provide age-friendly initiatives in the context of structural constraints and competing priorities (; ). At a government level, smaller communities are often competing with larger centres in relation to allocation of age-friendly resources and some communities may have age-friendly projects and initiatives competing with each other (). Thus, equitable resourcing is problematic in relation to existing tensions relating to regional versus local service provision. Many rural organizations are grappling with the desire to provide flexible, responsible local models of care to older people in greater need, against government mandates to provide more general, utilitarian models of care (; ; ).4. Contested spaces of rural aging are created through active and passive interactions between diverse older adults, wider community members, rural organizations, and policyAs the examples in our discussion have already alluded to, aging rural spaces become contested through the active and passive actions of both older people and rural community actors. In terms of active opposition, rural older adults contest negative stereotypes relating to aging through participation in daily activities, and their leisure and consumption activities (). They also resist service changes through active involvement as volunteers (; ). Older adults also mobilize at the grassroots level through advocacy and protest actions defending their rights (; ; ; ). However, trends relating to older people’s participation can change power structures within rural communities and organizations, which can prompt conflict (). Rural community not-for-profit organizations also resist structural changes initiated by government by undertaking advocacy and legal challenges against the development of market-oriented competition (). However, they are often simultaneously contesting the right of older people to age in place against these structural changes by mobilizing to provide volunteer services (). Continuing our earlier observation, albeit here at a macro-level, the media also play a significant role in highlighting the capacity for rural communities to resist structural change, through questioning the responsibility of volunteers against that of formal health systems (; ).However, contested rural aging spaces also are initiated through passive processes, whereby community actors resist policy imperatives relating to governmentality and positive aging by refusing to engage. For example, rural older people often refuse to travel long distances to access health care () and resist technological interventions that are designed to compensate for a lack of proximal services (). There is also evidence that rural older adults are increasingly reluctant to engage in community governance, voluntarism, and co-production of rural services (; ). Conversely, many rural older adults refuse to step down from community leadership positions (), and although there is an increasing emphasis on local organizations and clubs for the social care of older adults, many older people refuse to join groups that are perceived to have been hijacked by local power elites ().5. Contested spaces of rural aging can both create and reproduce inequity within rural communities for older adultsOutcomes of contested aging rural spaces manifest at both the individual and community levels. For older adults who can gain greater rights through these contested processes, this will likely result in a more agentic older age within a rural setting that fits their needs and preferences. However, this may not be advantageous for other older adults nor for the wider rural community, with contestation processes facilitated by or among older adults linked to community conflict over rights to the rural, deprivation, discrimination, and disconnectivity (; ). For those older persons who lose power or resources through these contested processes, this may result in a lack of fit (symbolically, politically, or culturally) and in some cases a more precarious experience of aging in place (). As highlighted above, active resistance is prominent among rural older adults in relation to access to rural space and aging in place. However, this is problematic where mobilization of rights is undertaken more actively by certain groups of rural older people, as these parties are more likely to have their voices heard in relation to resource allocation. However, this active mobilization can be beneficial where it places more pressure on rural community structures and governments to be more accommodating of their aging populations as a whole ().Similarly, although the previous discussion has highlighted the passive resistance that often occurs among older rural populations, this may have varied outcomes. Although lack of engagement in volunteer structures and community groups may be beneficial for some older adults from the perspective of their individual preferences and needs, it will likely pose issues for the sustainability of wider community groups and activities in rural settings (). This will restrict the capacity of more marginalized older adults to access community supports and services that they desire or require. Passive forms of resistance are also problematic where lack of engagement is contextualized as merely a “choice” by local power elites, rather than dissatisfaction with current rural aging processes and outcomes (). Advancing Rural Aging Research, Policy, and PracticeTaken together, the spaces of rural aging examined in this article contribute to understanding the contested ways in which rural environments are created and the diverse contexts within which aging is experienced. Although our five-part discussion is intended to make the dynamics associated with the development of aging rural spaces more explicit, the risk of over-simplifying and homogenizing the dynamics and processes associated with the development of rural contested spaces in particular places must be acknowledged. The processes illuminated here inevitably will be influenced by local rural specificities and different historical-geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural trajectories; the competing discourses of rural aging will be experienced and represented differently across diverse rural settings and among older adults. The conceptual framing outlined herein nevertheless provides a valuable starting point to interrogate further the diverse, complex, and nuanced ways in which rural spaces in older age are created, confronted, and contested.As revealed in the discussion presented above, rural aging can be understood as influenced by competing policies, discourses, and practices related to aging (healthy aging, aging in place), rurality (citizenship, governmentality), and community (participation, inequity), which combine in five interrelated ways to create contested, often unequal and even precarious spaces within which rural people are growing older. Underlying this perspective is the need to interrogate further the interactions among older people and their communities within different spaces of rural aging—the household, community, organizational, and structural—as a means of understanding how they are responding to the processes and outcomes of policies, discourses, and practices that shape experiences of rural aging. Toward this end, we advocate an approach to developing contextualized studies of rural aging spaces that account for the complexity and diversity of older rural people and aging rural places such that the experiences of older adults and the responses of their communities are viewed as not only mutually constituted, but also mutually transformative (see contributions to ). Greater attention to understanding how the contested spaces of rurality and aging intersect, and the importance of people–place interactions in creating spaces of rural aging, provides the foundation for a contextually sensitive perspective called for within an increasingly critical rural gerontology (). Given the interdependence between older rural adults’ fulfilment of certain responsibilities (e.g., volunteering, civic engagement) and the sustainability of rural communities (; ), a more nuanced understanding is essential in ensuring that the trajectories of rural communities continue to support aging in place for a greater diversity of older adults.To advance the field of inquiry,  highlights several ways in which greater attention to the creation of contested spaces can inform rural aging research, policy, and practice. Following , articulated as a suite of emergent questions for consideration within rural gerontology, policy discourse, and community leadership, the table provides a contextually sensitive framework for interrogating the implications of contested rural aging spaces for older adults, rural communities, and health policy. For example, the multiple processes and outcomes of creating rural aging spaces leads to new research questions about the manifestation of competing policies, discourses, and practices (e.g., among rural development and healthy aging policy priorities, different rural communities, diverse aging rural populations, and different forms of contestation). They also lead to strategic questions aimed at the development of rural aging policy that accounts for context; for instance, in regard to recognizing diverse forms of rural population aging, the rights and responsibilities of older adults, implications for sustainability, the role of national and sub-national policy in encouraging active forms of contestation and in confronting exclusion and marginalization. Perhaps most constructively, they can be used to ask pragmatic questions about how to improve programs in support of aging in rural communities. In this case, there is a clear need to understand how to manage competing policy discourses, to identify who is being disenfranchized and who is responsible for providing services and supports, to understand how to steer forms of contestation toward appropriate services for older adults, and to support initiatives that mediate negative outcomes. Table 1.Emergent Questions for Rural Aging Research, Policy, and Practice To conclude, in seeking to advance gerontological scholarship on contexts of aging (see other contributions to this special issue), this article explored how contested spaces of rural aging are created and the implications of these phenomena for the health and wellbeing of older adults, and the sustainability of their communities. The key dynamics of rural aging processes and outcomes articulated above, and our consideration of their implications for research, policy, and practice, provides the foundations for a contextually sensitive framework that is applicable to understanding and addressing the diversity of experiences of and responses to rural aging. Significantly, with subsequent attention to unpacking the elements of place (historical-geographical, socioeconomic, cultural, etc.), this framework is also transferable to other geographically, economically, and socially constructed contexts of aging (such as global, urban, indigenous, gendered, LGBT). In articulating a contextually sensitive approach, the article contributes to critically informed rural gerontology that is ever more relevant in contemporary aging societies.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesIn the United States, the older adult population and the proportion of neighborhoods experiencing gentrification are both growing. However, there is limited scholarship on the effects of gentrification on older adults, with most work focusing on those who leave rather than stay. This study examines the effects of remaining in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ self-rated health and mental health, with particular attention to outcomes for those who are economically vulnerable.Research Design and MethodsData are from 6,810 community-dwelling respondents in metropolitan areas from the first wave of the National Health & Aging Trends Study combined with the 1970–2010 National Neighborhood Change Database. We estimate the effects of gentrification on self-rated health and mental health separately using a quasi-experimental approach and comparing two methods: matching design and linear regression.ResultsEconomically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods reported higher self-rated health than economically vulnerable older adults in low-income neighborhoods. Both economically vulnerable and higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had more depression and anxiety symptoms than those living in more affluent areas. Higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods had poorer mental health than their counterparts in low-income neighborhoods.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings call attention to the complexity of gentrification, and the need for more research examining how the intersection of neighborhood and individual characteristics influences older adults’ health. Results reinforce the need for neighborhood-level interventions as well as relocation support to promote health in later life and caution against an overemphasis on aging in place. , , , , In the United States, the number of gentrifying neighborhoods has doubled since 1980 (). While gentrification involves investment in economically deprived neighborhoods, both scholarship and reports by the media note negative consequences for vulnerable populations, including increasing housing costs, involuntary displacement, and loss of social ties (; ). Concurrent with this rise of gentrification is a growing effort to help older adults age in place in their homes or communities. Some scholars have criticized this prioritization for ignoring older adults who are stuck in place in a neighborhood that fails to meet their needs (; ). Economically vulnerable older adults may be particularly at risk for poor health outcomes if they lack the financial means to relocate to better neighborhoods. To date, however, there has been limited scholarship on the effects of gentrification on older adults, with most focusing on those who leave (either voluntarily or involuntarily) rather than those who stay. To address this gap in the literature, this study examines the effects of living in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ self-rated health and mental health, with particular attention to outcomes for those who are economically vulnerable. Background and Literature ReviewBuilding on Ruth  work in the 1960s, scholars have understood gentrification as a market process in which low-income neighborhoods become higher income, typically in conjunction with the in-migration of new residents (). Gentrification is part of a shift by cities to a market orientation prioritizing capital investment over the well-being of existing residents (). Articles in the popular press emphasize the dangers of gentrification, including the loss of neighborhood character, steeply rising rents, and relocation of longtime residents (; ; ). However, the scholarly literature is less clear as to whether gentrification is beneficial or detrimental to neighborhood residents. One potential consequence is what  referred to as exclusionary displacement, by which economically vulnerable residents are priced out of gentrifying neighborhoods and forced into low-income neighborhoods because they have no other options.  note the risk of displacement has been a main focus of gentrification scholarship. Critical scholars view this displacement as unjust and advocate for coordinated policy responses such as the protection of affordable housing units (). However, findings from New York City (), Boston (), and other major cities in the United States suggest that gentrification does not necessarily result in the displacement of poor residents (; ).Questions remain about the connection between gentrification and displacement, and less is known about the consequences of continuing to live in a gentrifying area. Those who stay may lose vital informal networks as others are displaced, yet may also gain from improved safety and services (; ). Furthermore, the effects of gentrification are complex and may differ depending on individual demographic, social, and health characteristics. For example,  found that while gentrification is associated with better self-rated health overall, it has the opposite effect for African Americans.Similarly, current understanding of the effects of gentrification on older adults, whether low-income or otherwise, remains limited. The aging of residents combined with the aging of housing stock can create conditions for gentrification (; )—for example, low-income older adults make an assistance move or pass away, and their homes are subsequently occupied by higher-income residents (; ). Much work on the consequences of gentrification for older adults has focused also on their risk for displacement.  concluded that neighborhoods with the potential for gentrification experience a decrease in retired residents concomitant with an increase in young professionals. In a case study of older adults living in New York City,  found that gentrification is associated with both an increase in rents and a decrease in older adults. Alternatively,  reported that older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods are less likely to move than other age groups, suggesting many older adults remain. To our knowledge, there has been little research examining outcomes for older adults who stay in a gentrified neighborhoods, including self-rated health or mental health.It is important to study this link because disjunctions can occur between the aging individual and their changing neighborhood environment. The majority of older adults express a preference to stay in their current home and neighborhood () and aging in place is thought to foster place attachment, health, and well-being in later life (; ). However, remaining in the same home and neighborhood is not an optimal situation for everyone.  has warned against “one-size-fits-all aging in place solutions” (p. 393) that fail to acknowledge relocation as a necessary or desirable choice. For example, aging in place may not be an ideal living situation as household size decreases and home maintenance costs increase (). Furthermore, some older adults may be “stuck in place” () or “involuntary stayers” () because they do not have the financial resources to relocate. The limited research on older adults who are stuck in place indicates they are not only disadvantaged compared to other older adults in terms of their socioeconomic status, but also in their physical functioning, mental health, and social engagement (). There is a need for research to expand our understanding of the effects of neighborhood gentrification on older adults who stay, particularly those who are economically vulnerable and therefore possibly stuck in place. Purpose of the StudyIn summary, gerontological scholars have raised questions about the health consequences for older adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods characterized by an influx of higher-income younger residents along with services and businesses designed to meet their wants and needs (). Gentrification scholars have documented concerns about consequences for poor residents of all ages, including those who stay and those who are displaced; however, as noted by , “the literature on gentrification has failed to quantify accurately the negative impacts of gentrification” (p. 28). Because of the limited attention to older adults continuing to live in gentrifying neighborhoods, it remains unclear whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged compared to those living in low-income or affluent areas. Even less is known about economically vulnerable older adults who may be stuck in place. Although gentrification could bring new investment and services that improve health, it may also negatively affect health via skyrocketing housing costs, loss of formal and informal supports, or threat of eviction.According to one recent analysis, the number of U.S. neighborhoods experiencing gentrification doubled from 1980 to 2010 (). Furthermore, by 2010 almost 1 in 10 neighborhoods in center cities and inner suburbs had experienced gentrification pressure. More research is critical. The purposes of our study are to: (a) compare self-rated health and mental health of those living in gentrifying neighborhoods to those in low-income and higher-income neighborhoods, and (b) assess variations in these relationships by economic vulnerability. MethodsData and SampleWe used data from the baseline (2011) wave of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older in the United States that aims to examine disability trends and dynamics in late life, and understand how late-life changes affect social and economic circumstances (). Using the Medicare enrollment database as the sampling frame, NHATS employed a stratified three-stage sample design to ensure sufficient participation by age and race/ethnicity, oversampling those aged 90 or older, and African Americans (). A total of 8,245 older adults participated in 2011, for a response rate of 71%.NHATS data are available with census tract identifiers through a restricted data application. We merged these data with the 1970–2010 National Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB) produced by  to link census tracts across the decades. The NCDB includes census tracts within metropolitan Core Based Statistical Areas (formerly referred to as Metropolitan Statistical Areas; ). We restricted our sample to community-dwelling respondents in metropolitan areas for a final selected sample of 6,810. MeasuresHealth OutcomesTo examine the effects of gentrification on older adults’ health, we separately examined two dependent variables. First, we measured self-rated health using a single-item on a 5-point response scale (“Would you say that in general your health is…” 0 = poor, 1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, 4 = excellent). Self-rated health is a general measure used routinely in the literature that captures physical, social, emotional, and psychological well-being (; ). Self-rated health tends to be low among those with low socioeconomic status (SES) () or living in neighborhoods characterized by low SES ().Second, we measured mental health by examining depression and anxiety symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which assesses how often (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day) a respondent had little interest, felt down, felt nervous, or was unable to stop worrying over the past month. Summed scores range from 0 to 12, where a higher score indicates greater levels of depression and anxiety (). Although some studies report a significant association between neighborhood characteristics and mental health (), a systematic review found mixed evidence for a link between neighborhoods and mental health (). One study of urban-dwelling older adults, for example, reported that depressive symptoms appear primarily driven by individual characteristics rather than environmental ones (). Neighborhood TypeWe created three neighborhood types. First, we measured gentrifying neighborhoods using baseline conditions in the previous decade (; ). If in the year 2000 a neighborhood had an average household income less than the 40th percentile of the metropolitan area and resided in a primary city or inner-ring suburb, we categorized it as gentrifying if there was an increase in: (a) median household income, (b) percent of college-educated residents, (c) median owner-occupied housing values, and (d) median rent (, ; ). We identified low-income neighborhoods as those that had an average household income less than the 40th percentile of the metropolitan area in 2000 and did not gentrify by 2010. We categorized all other metropolitan neighborhoods as moderate-to-high income neighborhoods. Economic VulnerabilityWe used the receipt of Medicaid, a public program that provides health care coverage to low-income Americans, as an indicator of economic vulnerability (0 = no, 1 = yes). Although there is some variation in the financial eligibility requirements among states, Medicaid is only available to older adults with low incomes (e.g., <133% of the U.S. federal poverty level) and few financial assets. Control VariablesWe adjusted for characteristics found to be associated with self-rated health and mental health. Demographic characteristics included age in years, years at current address, born in the United States, high school graduate, female, and race/ethnicity. Health characteristics included number of diagnosed conditions (count of: heart attack, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, lung disease, stroke, dementia, or cancer); number of activities of daily living (ADL) limitations (count of difficulty with: eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, getting around the house, and getting in and out of bed); and has regular doctor (0 = no, 1 = yes). We also created a count variable of interviewer-observed number of neighborhood problems (i.e., presence of litter, graffiti, vacant houses, and/or foreclosure signs; range 0–4). Finally, social measures included number of people in social network (range 0–5) and any participation restriction in the following activities: visiting with friends and family; attending religious services; participating in clubs, classes, or other organized activities; and going out for enjoyment (0 = no, 1 = yes). Analysis PlanTo assess the impact of “exposure” to neighborhood type, we employed a quasi-experimental design. One threat to internal validity in this study is selection bias—unobserved characteristics associated with moving into a gentrifying neighborhood may be associated with outcomes. To account for selection bias, we used two methods in Stata 14 to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET), which is the difference in means between the treatment (e.g., living in gentrifying neighborhood) and comparison group (e.g., living in low-income neighborhood) after conditioning on these observed personal characteristics. First, we used a matching design that biases the estimate of ATET toward zero to ensure against a false positive. Second, we estimated a linear regression with endogenous treatment effects using maximum likelihood with survey weights. These regression estimates are less likely to have a false negative than the matched pair design. Because missing data were low (i.e., each item missing <2%), we used pairwise deletion.In the first design, to create the comparison groups, we matched on personal characteristics that influence neighborhood selection (i.e., age, years at current address, being born in the United States, educational attainment, number of children in the household, income, gender, race/ethnicity). We tested the assumption of conditional independence () and whether the treatment and comparison group have common support (i.e., a shared distribution; ). These assumptions were not violated.In our second design, we used linear regression with endogenous treatment effects. We employed the NHATS sampling weights to adjust for oversampling and nonresponse (; ), and calculated Taylor series linearized standard errors. We also calculated rho, the correlation between the treatment assignment error term and the outcome regression error term, as an informative diagnostic to detect selection bias (). For each dependent variable, we compared: (a) respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods versus respondents in low-income neighborhoods and (b) respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods versus respondents in moderate- or high-income neighborhoods. We report results separately for two mutually exclusive subpopulations: the economically vulnerable, and those with higher incomes. Results presents descriptive statistics for the sample by neighborhood types and economic vulnerability. Based on bivariate comparisons, among respondents living in gentrifying neighborhoods higher-income older adults were more likely to have better mental health status, live longer at their current addresses, have a high school diploma, and own their home compared to economically vulnerable older adults. There was no significant difference in health conditions by economic vulnerability. Among those living in low-income neighborhoods and moderate-to-high-income neighborhoods, higher-income older adults reported better health and mental health status, fewer levels of neighborhood problems, and lower levels of participation restriction than economically vulnerable older adults. Table 1.Characteristics of Selected Sample From 2011 Wave of National Health and Aging Trends Study (N = 6810) Note: Statistically significant bivariate comparisons between economically vulnerable and higher-income respondents p < .05: (a) gentrifying neighborhoods: “mental health,” “years at current address,” “born in US,” “high school graduate,” “own home,” “White,” and “other race”; (b) low-income neighborhoods: all were significant except “age” and “has regular doctor”; and (c) moderate-to-high-income neighborhoods: all were significant except “has regular doctor.” ADL = activities of daily living.aThere are discrepancies in sample size within a neighborhood type. For example, in gentrifying neighborhoods, columns add up to only 148 because of missing data on Medicaid receipt. Self-Rated HealthFor the matched pair design, the subpopulation of economically vulnerable respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods reported a .47 higher average difference in self-rated health to the subpopulation of economically vulnerable respondents in low-income neighborhoods (95% confidence interval [CIs] [.09, .85], p = .02). There were no statistically significant differences in self-rated health otherwise (not presented, results available on request).See  for multivariate regression models for self-rated health. The economically vulnerable respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods had a 1.81 higher average rating on self-rated health compared to economically vulnerable respondents in low-income neighborhoods. The relationship was in the same direction as the matched pair design, but the estimated effect size was higher after adjusting for control variables. This estimate is statistically significant with 95% CIs [1.10, 2.51], p < .001. Also in , the negative relationship on rho = −.78 indicates the estimated treatment effect is unlikely a false positive because unobserved variables that improve self-rated health are correlated with unobserved variables that lower the odds of living in a gentrifying neighborhood (i.e., the two selection biases may cancel each other out). Consistent with the matched pair design, other comparisons were not significant. Table 2.Linear Regression of Neighborhood Gentrification on Self-Rated Health Note: We measured gentrification’s effects using survey weights using svy etregress in Stata 14 to calculate the linearized standard errors. ADL = activities of daily living; Coef = coefficient; CI = confidence interval.*p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001. Mental HealthFor the matched pair design, there were no statistically significant differences in mental health as measured by PHQ-4 between respondents in gentrifying and low-income neighborhoods or those in moderate-to-high-income neighborhoods for either subpopulation (not presented, results available upon request). presents the multivariate results for mental health. Economically vulnerable respondents in a gentrifying neighborhood had a 4.79 higher score on the PHQ-4 (CI = 2.79–6.78) compared to economically vulnerable respondents in moderate- or high-income neighborhoods after adjusting for control variables. In addition, higher-income respondents in a gentrifying neighborhood had a 3.64 higher score on the PHQ-4 (CI = 2.87–4.41) compared to higher-income respondents in moderate- or high-income neighborhoods after adjusting for control variables. For both subpopulations, the negative relationship on rho (−.76 and −.77, respectively) indicates the estimated treatment effect is unlikely to be a false positive. Somewhat surprisingly, higher-income respondents in a gentrifying neighborhood had a 3.62 higher score on the PHQ-4 (CI = 2.84–4.41) compared to higher-income respondents in low-income neighborhoods after adjusting for control variables. The negative relationship on rho = −.81 indicates that our estimated treatment effect is unlikely to be a false positive. In summary, although the conservative matched pair designs were not significant, the adjusted regression estimates identified subgroups in gentrifying neighborhoods with more symptoms of anxiety and depression.

DiscussionOur results contribute to an understanding of the consequences of living in a neighborhood undergoing renewal by examining the effects of living in a gentrifying neighborhood on older adults’ health. Of particular concern are outcomes for older adults who are economically vulnerable, given the recognition that a segment of the older adult population may be stuck in place in neighborhoods that do not support their needs (). For physical health, economically vulnerable respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods have better self-rated health than those in low-income neighborhoods. For mental health, although the conservative matched pair design did not find any significant effects, the adjusted regression estimates showed that both economically vulnerable and higher-income older adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods have greater risk for anxiety and depression than those in other neighborhoods. Taken together, these findings reinforce prior work acknowledging the complexity of the effects of gentrification, including how effects differ based on individual characteristics.Although previous literature notes the potential for deleterious outcomes of living in either low-income or gentrifying neighborhoods (), our results suggest gentrifying neighborhoods are a more optimal environment for economically vulnerable older adults for self-rated health. Low-income neighborhoods often have physical and social deprivations, including limited access to amenities and services or a lack of social cohesion (), which in turn are associated with poor health outcomes, including functional decline (), cognitive impairments (), and lower quality of life (). In gentrifying neighborhoods, by contrast, economically vulnerable older adults may benefit from reinvestment. It is possible that economically vulnerable older adults rely more on what is in their immediate neighborhood, whereas higher-income older adults are able to access resources outside their neighborhood by traveling or having resources brought to them.Our findings regarding mental health indicate that both higher income and economically vulnerable older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods are disadvantaged in terms of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to their counterparts in moderate-to-high-income neighborhoods. We also found that higher-income older adults in gentrifying neighborhoods have more depression and anxiety symptoms compared to those in low-income neighborhoods, but there are no such differences among economically vulnerable older adults. Those with higher incomes may not be immune to the stresses of living in a changing neighborhood. Increasing housing costs, fears about displacement, and the replacement of businesses and services cited in the literature (e.g., ; ) may be more problematic for the mental health of higher-income older adults compared to those in low-income neighborhoods. ImplicationsOur findings have several implications for research, policy, and practice. Differences between the economically vulnerable and higher-income respondents, as well as inconsistent findings when comparing the results for self-rated health and mental health, suggest critical directions for future research. These include addressing the limitations of the current study, such as designating Medicaid receipt as a proxy for economic vulnerability and the absence of some relevant variables in NHATS, including place attachment and residential satisfaction. Furthermore, we employed Census tract data to define gentrification instead of direct observation, which is an imperfect reflection of the spaces that actually matter to individuals (). Due to confidentiality concerns, NHATS does not offer access to respondents’ addresses. Although the model had time ordering, it cannot account for simultaneity or time-varying covariates that are correlated with the outcome. The findings for PHQ-4 results are not robust to a conservative matched pair design, indicating the findings of the regression model are not necessarily spurious but should be interpreted with caution.Furthermore, future research should examine the implications for neighborhood and demographic change as the number of gentrifying neighborhoods and proportion of older Americans remaining in their community and out of institutional care are increasing (; ). More in-depth information is needed from older adults, including the extent to which they are aging in place by choice or stuck in place. For example,  categorizes some older adults as the “elected,” in the sense that they have the power to exercise choice over where they live, whereas others are excluded from a changing neighborhood environment but lack the resources to change their situation. This reinforces the need for future studies to examine not only length of residence in a neighborhood, but the aging individual’s feelings of place attachment. Future research could measure gentrification using direct observation or Google Street View to rate block by block the level of gentrification (), and study different types of gentrifying neighborhoods (). Finally, while this study focused on the intersection of economic vulnerability and neighborhood gentrification, other key dimensions to examine include ethnicity, gender, and age.In terms of policy and practice implications, while we were unable to assess the extent to which NHATS participants are stuck in place, our findings support work cautioning against an overemphasis on aging in place (; ; ; ). This sample lived in their current home for a mean of 23.5 years, with three quarters having been in their home at least 7 years. Respondents in gentrifying neighborhoods had lived in their home an average of 27.13 years. There are two strategies to address the potential negative consequences of gentrification. First, policymakers and practitioners can support the relocation of older adults who wish to move to a different neighborhood. For example, in Detroit a university/community partnership is facilitating desired relocation through an assessment tool for aging services providers to identify quality affordable housing, particular those that accept housing vouchers, in desirable neighborhoods (). Such a strategy, however, depends on the availability of affordable housing, which is currently in short supply (). Indeed, nearly 1.5 million older adult households are low-income renters who do not receive government housing assistance and pay more than half of their income on rent, live in poor housing conditions, or both (). Therefore, any efforts to support older adults’ relocation options need to be integrated with long-term affordable housing development, consistent with the recommendations of .Second, there is a need for policies, programs, and infrastructure changes to support older adults who wish to age in place in a gentrifying neighborhood. One prominent example of this approach is the growing number of age-friendly community initiatives (AFCIs) that engage residents, multiple sectors, and professions to modify a neighborhood’s physical and social environment to meet the needs of older adults. AFCIs face a number of challenges, including the potential exclusion of certain older adults (including those who are low-income, older, frailer, or from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds), limited empirical evidence to identify best practices, and the difficulties of moving from an assessment phase to an action phase. But they also offer the promise of better aligning individual needs with neighborhood supports and opportunities (). While gentrification raises critical concerns for vulnerable residents, any approach that embraces social justice must ensure that the positive effects of gentrification be shared by all and not just the newly arrived younger and wealthier residents.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesProximity to health care, healthy foods, and recreation is linked to improved health in older adults while deterioration of the built environment is a risk factor for poor health. Yet, it remains unclear whether individuals prone to good health self-select into favorable built environments and how long-term exposure to deteriorated environments impacts health. This study uses a longitudinal framework to address these questions.Research Design and MethodsThe study analyzes 3,240 Americans aged 45 or older from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with good self-reported health at baseline, and follows them from 1999 to 2013. At each biennial survey wave, individual data are combined with data on services in the neighborhood of residence (defined as the zip code) from the Economic Census. The analysis overcomes the problem of residential self-selection by employing marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weights.ResultsLogistic regression estimates indicate that long-term exposure to neighborhood built environments that lack health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, grocery stores, senior centers, and recreational facilities) and are commercially declined (i.e., have a high density of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) increases the risk of fair/poor self-rated health compared to more average neighborhoods. Short-term exposure to the same environments as compared to average neighborhoods has no bearing on self-rated health after adjusting for self-selection.Discussion and ImplicationsResults highlight the importance of expanding individuals’ access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods. , , , A growing literature has documented associations between neighborhoods and health, and built environment has been described as one key mechanism linking neighborhood context to health outcomes (). Prior research indicates that proximity to built environments with many health-related goods and services is associated with improved health outcomes (; ), while residence in commercially declined areas (those with a preponderance of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food outlets) may be a risk factor for poor health (). However, most researchers are wary of drawing strong claims that built environment impacts health from past work, in part because most prior studies do not account for two key methodological challenges. The first challenge is dynamic neighborhood selection, whereby individuals self-select into various neighborhood built environments. The second challenge is that of cumulative neighborhood exposure. Short-term health impacts of the current neighborhood built environment may differ from long-term impacts that accumulate over time, but few studies explore both. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between neighborhood built environment and the onset of fair/poor self-rated health among older adults. The study relies on nationally representative, longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) over a 14-year period (1999–2013) matched with annually updated data from the Economic Census to addresses the challenges of dynamic neighborhood selection and short-term versus cumulative exposure. BackgroundAssociations between neighborhoods and health are not entirely explained by individual characteristics like race, education, or income. Therefore, many recent studies of health have drawn from the “neighborhood effects” literature to identify health predictors in the physical and social environment (; ; ; ). These studies consistently find that neighborhood structural factors like socioeconomic status, poverty, and employment rates are associated with individual health outcomes. However, it is theorized that these structural neighborhood factors operate through more direct mechanisms like social cohesion, stress, transportation, and access to services. A growing number of studies explore these specific mechanisms (; ; ; ). These studies get closer to explaining why neighborhood conditions like poverty are associated with health. Such information is useful for the design and implementation of place-based changes to improve population health.The built service environment—defined here as the geographic availability of health, retail, and recreational services in the neighborhood—is one specific mechanism that may link neighborhoods and health. This link may occur for at least three reasons. First, proximity to services like physicians, pharmacies, and supermarkets may directly improve health by making it easier to obtain medical care and purchase health-related goods like medications and healthy food. Indeed, geographic access to health care services has been positively associated with health and health care utilization (; ), and access to supermarkets has been associated with lower risk of obesity (). Proximity to other services might worsen health, as increased access to alcohol and fast food outlets has been linked to obesity, chronic disease, and injury (; ). Second, the built service environment may influence health-related behaviors like diet and exercise. Increased recreational opportunities like playgrounds, parks, and gyms have been related to higher levels of physical activity (). Increased access to supermarkets has been associated with healthier diets (), whereas increased access to alcohol and fast food has been linked to poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption (; Fuzhong et al., 2009). Third, the built service environment may influence neighborhood social processes like social interaction, social cohesion, and feelings of safety, all linked to health (; ). Community centers or parks may encourage or discourage interaction, depending on whether they appear well-maintained and free from crime. Similarly, high densities of liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food may signal to residents that neighborhoods are unsafe (). An increased fear of crime is linked to worse health outcomes (; ) and risk factors for poor health like low physical activity and social isolation (; ). Collectively, prior work suggests that the built service environment is linked to health through multiple direct and indirect pathways that are often related and self-reinforcing. Based on this evidence, I hypothesize that:H1: older adults with greater geographic access to health-supportive services (e.g., physicians, pharmacies, supermarkets, and recreational facilities) have better health outcomes.H2: older adults residing in areas with commercial decline (e.g., liquor stores, pawn shops, and fast food) are at increased risk for poor health.Despite the important contributions of prior studies, health impacts of the built environment are still inconclusive. Unlike the studies described previously, many other studies investigating links between heath and aspects of the built environment report no associations (for example, see work by , on grocery stores and  on recreational facilities). These mixed findings may arise from inconsistencies in how prior research has addressed two key methodological challenges: dynamic neighborhood selection and short-term versus cumulative neighborhood exposure.Dynamic neighborhood selection is an implicit selection process whereby individual characteristics, including health, may influence neighborhood choice, which in turn affects future outcomes like health. The types of moves made in later life differ substantially by health status (). Compared to healthier individuals, individuals in poor health have higher rates of residential mobility (; ), but are less likely to escape disadvantaged neighborhoods with their move (). Healthier older adults, who also tend to be younger, wealthier, and more often married, are more likely to make moves motivated by lifestyle factors like leisure, public transportation, and shopping, compared to movers in poor health (). Exposure to particular types of neighborhoods may not only directly affect health, but may also impact the assets that residents have for future residential moves. As a result, the people who maintain or gain residence in advantageous neighborhoods as a partial virtue of their health may be able to further delay health declines.Most studies attempt to address selection bias by controlling for a host of individual characteristics (like age, race, marital status, and income) predictive of both residential location and health. Indeed, failing to control for individual-level confounders runs the risk of overestimating neighborhood impacts on health. But that solution is imperfect, as time-varying individual characteristics are influenced by prior neighborhood context, and controlling for them ultimately leads to underestimating or “controlling-away” the complete impact of neighborhoods (; ). Alternative strategies that better deal with selection have recently gained momentum in the neighborhoods literature (; ; ). These studies first model neighborhood selection to obtain the probability of living in neighborhoods of various types, and then adjust for these probabilities in a second model predicting the outcome of interest. These are known as marginal structural models (MSMs) with inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weights. They are a means of incorporating the indirect effects of neighborhoods while still adjusting for neighborhood selection. While neighborhood studies employing MSMs have not focused specifically on the built environment, they have generally found that neighborhood-health associations are robust to selection bias (; ). Some have also found that conventional regression underestimates the impact of neighborhoods on health compared to MSMs (). Such studies provide important clues about underlying selection processes. However, these studies have largely explored neighborhood poverty or levels of disadvantage, rather than the built environment. The results are not necessarily transferable, as different selection processes may govern different neighborhood characteristics. For instance, movers may specifically select neighborhoods for a built environment feature (e.g., seeking out neighborhoods with parks), but they may be unaware of the actual poverty rate. In this example, there is stronger potential for selection bias associated with the built environment than with poverty. Thus, it is important to investigate built environment on its own to evaluate this study’s third hypothesis:H3: observed links between neighborhood built environment and health persist after accounting for dynamic neighborhood selection.The long period over which dynamic neighborhood selection unfolds draws attention to potential long-term impacts of neighborhoods. Especially with health, there may be a distinction between short-term impacts of neighborhoods and impacts that accumulate over many years. Cross-sectional studies (; ) and even some longitudinal studies () of neighborhood effects on health focus on short-term exposure by measuring characteristics of the neighborhood concurrently or in the 1 or 2 years immediately prior to the measurement of health. Recent studies have begun to explore long-term effects by calculating cumulative averages from longitudinal data of neighborhood characteristics experienced over a long period of time. Studies employing this technique have documented health impacts of long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage () and neighborhood poverty (), but they have not examined the built environment. Furthermore, very few researchers compare short- and long-term exposure, with the exception of , who find that long-term exposure to neighborhood poverty is more strongly linked to mortality than short-term exposure. Research is needed comparing short- and long-term health impacts of the built environment, but related studies suggest length of exposure may be an important conceptual consideration. Based on previous evidence, I hypothesize that:H4: cumulative exposure to health-supportive services and commercial decline is more strongly associated with health than short-term exposure.The current study relies on longitudinal data to investigate associations between health and the built environment. In doing so, this study contributes to the ongoing debate of whether neighborhood-health associations represent causal connections or selection biases. It does so for the built environment, a neighborhood characteristic that has yet to be explored with models that better account for selection or cumulative exposure. By focusing on a different aspect of the neighborhood than prior studies, this study also addresses the possibility that selection and cumulative exposure are more important for some neighborhood characteristics than for others. Finally, by focusing on a specific mechanism linking neighborhoods and health, this study can provide valuable insight into direct, actionable ways to create neighborhood contexts that support healthy aging, through improving built environments. Design and MethodsSampleThis study utilizes data from the PSID for the years 1999 to 2013. The PSID is a nationally representative, longitudinal study of U.S. families that began in 1968 and has continued to follow individuals from the core sample and their descendants over time. Respondents were interviewed biennially from 1999 to 2013. The sample consists of community-dwelling adults aged 45 and older at baseline (1999) who are designated as a household head or spouse and in good self-reported health. Data are structured as a series of person-periods, each referring to the 2-year period between successive PSID interviews. The analytical sample includes 15,372 person-periods, corresponding to 3,240 unique respondents who range in age from 45 to 104. MeasuresSelf-Rated HealthHealth status is represented by self-rated health, a subjective measure that encompasses mental and physical health () and is predictive of objective health outcomes like disability, morbidity, and mortality (; ). Self-rated health responses are dichotomized so that a value of “1” indicates fair or poor self-rated health and “0” indicates excellent, very good, or good self-rated health. Only respondents in excellent, very good, or good health at baseline (1999) are included in the analysis. The outcome of interest is the first onset of fair or poor self-rated health, occurring between 2001 and 2013. Person-periods after the first onset of fair/poor health are excluded from the analysis. Respondents in the sample are observed an average of 4.5 person-periods, corresponding to 9 years, before the onset of fair/poor health. Respondents range in age from 46 to 99 at the time of fair/poor health onset. Built EnvironmentTo guide the measurement of neighborhood built environment, I reviewed the literatures on neighborhood service environments and neighborhood disadvantage. While there is general agreement on the types of services that are salient for health, it is more difficult to determine how to specify the service measures (e.g., as categories or continuous measures). Prior research suggests that environmental effects on health are generally nonlinear and often only emerge in the most disadvantaged living conditions (; ). For this reason, researchers often create categories (generally defined by medians or percentiles of the variable of interest) to represent levels of neighborhood exposures (; ; ; ). This allows for comparisons of living in the most disadvantaged category to the other categories. Furthermore, it allows for estimating the probability of living in each neighborhood category, a necessary component of the MSMs.For these reasons, I constructed a five-category typology of built environment, based on the density of health-supportive services and commercial decline in respondents’ zip codes. Services are identified by their NAICS industry classification codes using year-specific data from the Economic Census (1999–2013). Zip codes are based on the Census Bureau’s delineation of 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Areas. Health-supportive services density is constructed by summing the number of supermarkets (NAICS 44511), pharmacies (NAICS 44611), health care services (NAICS 621), hospitals (NAICS 622), residential care facilities (NAICS 623), senior services (NAICS 62412), and recreational facilities (NAICS 71394) in the zip code and dividing by the zip code population. Commercial decline is constructed by summing the number of liquor stores (NAICS 4453), pawn shops (NAICS 45331), and fast food outlets (NAICS 722513) in the zip code and dividing by the zip code population. Less than 1% of person-periods are missing values for zip code services and are multiply imputed. Zip code population and other aggregate demographics are obtained from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Decennial Censuses, using linear interpolation for non-census years. describes the categorization, based on quartiles of health-supportive services density and commercial-decline density. The resulting categories include: high density: zip codes with high densities of health-supportive services and commercial decline; low density: zip codes with low densities of health-supportive services and commercial decline; service dense: zip codes with high density of health-supportive services and low density of commercial decline; commercially declined: zip codes with low density of health-supportive services and high density of commercial decline; and average: zip codes with medium densities of health-supportive services and commercial decline. There are a few zip codes that have unusually high service densities despite having only a few establishments, because they have very small populations. To minimize the impact of these outliers, I restrict the high-density and service-dense categories to those with at least five health-supportive services, and the high-density and commercially declined categories to those with at least five commercially declined services. In addition, places with one or zero health-supportive and commercially declined services are automatically categorized as low density. Importantly, the results are fairly robust to alternate specifications of the neighborhood categories. A more restrictive typology, where only the 1st and 4th quartiles are considered nonaverage, results in stronger effects but substantively similar results to those presented here. A less restrictive typology, where categories are dichotomized to above or below and the median and the “average” category is eliminated, results in weaker effects than those presented here. I ultimately chose the current specification because it provides conservative estimates while still allowing some neighborhoods to be classified as “average”. Table 1.Zip code built environment typology To examine short-term impacts of the built environment, a single-point-in-time typology is constructed for each wave prior to the measurement of self-rated health. Long-term impacts are examined with a cumulative typology, calculated from a running average of health-supportive services density and commercial decline density that is averaged from all survey waves from the baseline up to and including the prior wave. Both typologies would be unnecessary if individuals rarely moved between neighborhood categories, as most people could be characterized with a single, time-invariant neighborhood measure. However, many sample respondents experience a change in neighborhood category, either through a residential move or through changes in the surrounding neighborhood. About 40% of the sample at any point in time lives in a neighborhood category that is different than their baseline category. CovariatesCovariates of self-rated health are included in the analyses as either time-invariant or time-varying characteristics. Time-invariant covariates include race, sex, age, marital status, years of education, family income, family size, homeownership, whether the respondent's household is headed by a female, and employment status of the household head, all measured at baseline. Baseline health measures are also included to adjust for prior health history and its impact on neighborhood selection. They include number of chronic conditions ever diagnosed (cancer, arthritis, diabetes, lung disease, asthma, hypertension, heart disease, heart attack, or stroke), number of functional limitations (difficulty walking, getting in/out of bed, using the toilet, getting outside, eating, dressing, and bathing), body mass index, frequency of physical activity per week, and whether the respondent currently smokes. Time-varying covariates are measured in the prior survey wave or as a running average of all previous survey waves. They include family income, family size, marital status, female-headed household, homeownership, employment of the household head, whether the household head retired or became unemployed, and whether the respondent became widowed or divorced. Up to 4% of values of the individual covariates are missing and are multiply imputed. To account for possible confounding of built environments with other neighborhood attributes, models also control for structural characteristics of zip codes derived from census data. These are population, land area, population density, location in a metropolitan area, percent poor, percent college-educated, and percent non-white. Statistical MethodsResults are initially estimated with conventional logistic regression models predicting the onset of fair/poor self-rated health with baseline and time-varying covariates. The contribution of selection bias is then evaluated by comparing results of the conventional models to MSMs utilizing IPT weights. The MSM method proceeds in two steps. In step 1, the treatment assignment (built environment category) is modeled. Prior-wave neighborhood built environment category, baseline covariates, baseline built environment category, and time-varying covariates are used to predict the respondent’s probability of residing in each built environment category in the current wave. Respondents are then assigned a treatment weight, following the procedure for calculating and stabilizing IPT weights outlined in . The weighting process essentially creates a pseudopopulation that upweights individuals whose neighborhood exposure is underrepresented (compared to what would have been observed through random assignment), and downweights individuals whose neighborhood exposure is overrepresented. Within this pseudopopulation, treatment and time-varying confounders are no longer associated ().The IPT method is also frequently used to account for selective attrition (; ). In this study, respondents are censored if they die, are lost to follow-up, are institutionalized, or are no longer a designated household head or spouse. To account for potential attrition bias, censoring weights are generated using the same process and covariates described for calculating the neighborhood weights. The final weights used in the analysis are the product of multiplying the stabilized censoring weight and the stabilized neighborhood weight for each respondent in each survey year.In step 2, the generated weights are used as probability weights in a logistic regression equation estimating effects of the built environment (captured with the single-point-in-time and cumulative measures) on the probability of fair/poor self-rated health onset. The equation is referred to as a MSM because it models the marginal distribution of potential outcomes after adjusting for time-dependent confounders (). Results utilizing the single-point-in-time measure and the cumulative measure are compared to assess differences in short- versus long-term impacts of the built environment. All regression models use Huber-White clustered standard errors to account for multiple observations of the same individual over time and clustering of spouses within households. Results reports descriptive statistics of the sample in the baseline year of 1999. All respondents were in good self-reported health at baseline. On average, respondents were just older than 56 years, 48% were male and 52% were female, most were non-Latino white (76%), most were married (76%) and employed (69%), and their annual family incomes were $79,261. Respondents at baseline had been diagnosed with less than one chronic condition and had less than one functional limitation on average, an overall indicator of their good health. The most common built environment category at baseline was average (41%), followed by low density (30%), high density (13%), service dense (12%), and commercially declined (3.3%). Table 2.PSID sample characteristics at baseline (1999) Note: First of 10 imputation data sets.aFamily income is standardized to the year 2000 consumer price index. reports descriptive statistics of time-varying characteristics separately for person-periods in which the respondent remained in good self-rated health and person-periods characterized by the onset of fair/poor health. Differences between those in good versus fair/poor health for all reported statistics are statistically significant at the 99% confidence level, with the exception of job loss and retirement. Respondents experiencing the onset of fair/poor health are older on average than respondents remaining in good health. They have family incomes that are on average about $30,000 lower, are more likely to be recently widowed or divorced, and are less likely to own their home compared to respondents in good health. Differences in the built environment by health status are prevalent. Those in good health are more likely to currently live in high-density or service-dense environments, where they have the greatest access to health-supportive services. In contrast, respondents experiencing the onset of fair/poor health are more likely to reside in low-density or commercially declined areas. Table 3.Time-varying characteristics, by self-rated health Note: First of 10 imputation data sets. Differences by self-rated health are statistically significant at p < .01, with the exception of recently retired and unemployed, which are not significantly different.aFamily income is standardized to the year 2000 consumer price index.To get at structural differences in the types of built environments,  shows how each built environment category is characterized by census demographics. High-density built environments are indeed denser (in terms of population) than average places, and they have higher rates of college degrees, are more racially diverse, and are almost exclusively within metropolitan areas. A quintessential example of a neighborhood that would be categorized as high density is Brooklyn, New York. In contrast, low-density environments have sparse populations that are less racially diverse and have lower rates of college degrees compared to most other places. They are exemplified by many of the nation’s small towns, and also by outlying areas of some larger metros. Service-dense places are perhaps the most advantaged category, with below-average poverty rates and above-average rates of college degrees. Places like San Mateo, California, would be classified as service-dense. Finally, commercially declined places are perhaps the most disadvantaged. They have large populations, the highest population densities, poverty rates near 20%, the lowest rate of college degrees, and are predominately non-white. As an example, several inner-city Detroit neighborhoods would be classified as commercially declined. Table 4.Zip code built environment categories and census characteristics Note: First of 10 imputation data sets.The logistic regression results further describe the health impacts of these environments.  compares results from conventional regression models with MSMs incorporating IPT weights. Panel 1 shows the set of models focusing on short-term exposure. To be most comparable with the MSMs, the conventional models control for the same baseline and time-varying covariates. The conventional models show no short-term impacts of neighborhood built environment on health. This is consistent with other studies reporting no effects (; ), but to date, it has been unclear whether “over-controlling” for individual covariates previously influenced by neighborhood selection has led to the lack of significant findings. However, the corresponding MSM, which better accounts for selection, also shows no short-term health impact of the built environment. This stage of the analysis shows no evidence that over-controlling for selection obscures short-term built environment impacts. Rather, it suggests that built environments may not be associated with health in the short-term. Table 5.Logistic regression estimates of the short- and long-term effects of built environment on first onset of fair/poor self-rated health (N = 15,372) Note: Combined estimates from 10 multiple imputation data sets. All models include all baseline and time-varying individual and zip code covariates, although their effects are not reported.*p < .05., panel 2, shows corollary results for longer-term environmental exposures. The same outcome variable (onset of fair/poor self-rated health) is predicted by the built environment category experienced, on average, by the respondent across every wave since the baseline. For respondents in the last wave, this amounts to 14 years of exposure. Results from the conventional model show that respondents with long-term exposure to low-density or commercially declined environments are at heightened risk of poor health compared to respondents in average environments. However, the corresponding MSM suggests that the conventional results for low-density environments should be interpreted with caution. The MSM reports no significant difference between low-density and average environments. Rather, it suggests that residential patterns, whereby individuals prone to poor health move to (or stay in) low-density environments, explains the apparent association between low-density neighborhoods and poor health. In contrast, the association between health and commercially declined neighborhoods persists in the MSM, even with the adjustment for neighborhood selection. More specifically, the MSM indicates the odds of fair/poor health onset are 1.851 times larger for residents of commercially declined environments compared to residents of average environments. In contrast, there is no observed difference in the odds of fair/poor health between high-density, low-density, service-dense, and average neighborhoods. DiscussionThis study contributes to growing evidence that built environment, and neighborhood context more generally, impacts healthy aging. The analysis builds on recent research showing that health-supportive services and neighborhood commercial decline influence health outcomes for older adults, while addressing some of the shortcomings of prior work. By investigating data from a longitudinal, nationally representative sample in models that deal with selection and cumulative exposure, this study provides more comprehensive evidence of the associations between built environment and health beyond the evidence contained in prior studies.The evidence presented here suggests that older adults in commercially declined neighborhoods are at increased risk for poor health compared to older adults in average neighborhoods. This provides support for the first hypothesis (that lack of access to health-supportive services diminishes health) and the second hypothesis (that commercial decline diminishes health), with one important caveat: it is the combination of lack of health services and commercial decline that has the most meaningful impact on health. Neighborhoods that have either limited services or commercial decline are no riskier for health than average neighborhoods. In contrast, neighborhoods with a lack of desirable services along with prolific signs of disorder significantly diminish health compared to average neighborhoods. A potential explanation is that health services and commercial decline interact—high rates of commercial decline may render the few existing health resources relatively unusable. For example, residents of commercially declined neighborhoods may feel unsafe leaving their homes or traveling to the few nearby physicians or supermarkets. Residents of other neighborhoods may feel safe because signs of disorder are few or are balanced out by more desirable amenities. The results confirm prior evidence that older adults who face difficulty accessing health services are at greater risk for health declines (; ; ), but also suggests that an important piece of the “difficulty” with access may be related to neighborhood disorder. Future research should work to untangle the complex and possibly reciprocal relationships between neighborhood services and disorder. The findings also underscore the idea that health impacts often only emerge in the most disadvantaged environments (; ). Thus, policies should prioritize expanding health-supportive services in underserved neighborhoods coupled with reducing commercial decline in such neighborhoods, so that all older adults have unfettered access to at least an average level of services. Devoting resources to improving neighborhoods beyond this point is likely to produce diminishing returns for population health.The third hypothesis (that the health effects of built environments persist after accounting for dynamic neighborhood selection) is supported for long-term effects only. This suggests that short-term effects of the built environment reported in prior studies may actually be driven by selection processes, such as healthier individuals moving out of neighborhoods that lack health services for better areas. But in the long-term, the impacts of built environments appear to accumulate, impacting not only current health but future residential selections, and in turn, future health. More work needs to be done to better understand the selection processes that sort healthier individuals into advantageous neighborhoods and individuals prone to poor health into deteriorated neighborhoods. But it is also apparent that selection may not fully explain long-term associations between neighborhoods and health, supporting the idea of an independent cumulative neighborhood effect. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that resources for expanding access to services may be most impactful if directed towards people unlikely to attain residence in age-friendly environments on their own.The fourth hypothesis is also supported, as cumulative exposure to commercially declined neighborhoods seems to matter much more than short-term exposure (if short-term exposure matters at all, as this study did not detect any short-term effects). The cumulative impacts may reflect the direct health consequences of living many years with limited access to physicians, healthy foods, and other health resources. But they may also reflect the aggregate effect of prior residential choices, whereby prior neighborhood context influenced health directly and also indirectly through ongoing residential choices. Given that existing research on built environments and health primarily focuses on recent surroundings, a priority for future research should be investigating residential histories and cumulative environmental exposures. This is especially important in light of evidence that few residents of high-poverty neighborhoods experience upward residential mobility (). Furthermore, because the impact of built environment on health may unfold over a long period of time, researchers exploring short-term measures should be cautious of concluding that built environments have no impact on health. From a policy perspective, these results underscore the need for a long-term outlook in the development of “age-friendly” neighborhoods. Policies and practices supporting age-friendly environments may need to be enacted before the people they intend to help reach old age. Furthermore, short-term changes likely cannot undo years of exposure to disadvantaged built environments.This study has several limitations. Most important, environmental exposure is determined solely by geographic availability of services, ignoring other important considerations like cost, quality, and transportation (). I utilize zip code boundaries in part by necessity, to align with the industry data. But zip codes may vary greatly internally and may not adequately capture older adults’ activity spaces. A related limitation is that this study does not directly identify the specific behaviors linking neighborhood services to health. It remains unclear whether, for example, lack of health-supportive services diminishes health because people are less likely to visit a physician, eat healthy foods, exercise, or some combination of these and other behaviors. Another limitation has to do with the measurement of self-rated health. The associated categories (i.e. “fair”, “poor”, “good”, etc.) may not mean the same to different individuals or even to the same individual over time. Furthermore, the factors that give rise to poor health may be variably related to neighborhoods. Some individuals may fall into poor health for reasons that have little to do with their neighborhood, but this study does not distinguish among the underlying conditions leading to health declines. Future research should explore whether neighborhood impacts on health are sensitive to different conceptualizations of health. ConclusionThis study further clarified relationships between self-rated health and built environment by exploring both short-term and cumulative environmental exposure, and dealing with dynamic neighborhood selection. The findings add to growing evidence that residential context influences healthy aging. They also highlight the importance of expanding individuals’ access to health-supportive services prior to their reaching old age, and expanding access for people unlikely to attain residence in service-dense neighborhoods. Future research should examine how other contextual factors—like crime, family and friendship networks, and housing—impact older adult health in the short-term versus the long-term, and how they are related to residential selection processes.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesThe importance of self-perceptions of aging (SPA) for health and longevity is well documented. Comparably little is known about factors that contribute to SPA. Besides individual factors, the context a person lives in may shape SPA. Research has so far focused on country-level differences in age stereotypes, indicating that rapid population aging accompanies more negative age stereotypes. The present study expands previous research by investigating the impact of district-specific population aging within one country on different facets of SPA.Research Design and MethodsBased on a large representative survey in Germany, the study investigates changes in SPA as ongoing development as well as the SPA of physical loss over a 12-year period in adults aged 40+. The study uses several indicators of population aging (e.g., population development, average age, greying index), to identify four clusters differing in their pace of population aging. Based on three-level latent change models, these clusters were compared in their impact on changes in SPA.ResultsCompared to districts with an average rate of population aging, the study shows that persons living in regions with a fast population aging rate (C1) hold more negative SPA in both facets (ps = .01). Districts with slow population aging (C2) have significantly higher SPA ongoing development (p = .03).Discussion and ImplicationsThe study underlines the importance for regional differences in population aging on the development of SPA. In particular, societies should be aware that fast population aging may result in more negative SPA. , , , A growing body of research underlines the importance of investigating contextual influences on psychological phenomena such as attitudes and values ().  collected empirical evidence on the effects of contextual factors on developmental trajectories in later life. The authors state that four components of context may be linked to individual development: economic characteristics (e.g., level of poverty or rate of unemployment), service characteristics (e.g., availability and accessibility of health services), social characteristics (e.g., social ties or perceived discrimination), and physical characteristics (e.g., features of the built environment or accessibility). Aging well is thus shaped by individual resources and constraints as well as contextual factors on various levels (e.g., country, region, and neighborhood). An important indicator of aging well is the individual view on one’s own aging process. Numerous studies have illustrated the far-reaching importance of self-perceptions of aging (SPA) for health, well-being, and longevity (). However, little is known about which factors, besides individual characteristics, may shape SPA. Considering the speed of current demographic change and population aging in most industrialized countries, their impact on SPA should clearly be assessed. Thus, the current study investigates the effect differences in the pace of population aging on SPA have regionally, over 12 years. Determinants of SPAIn accordance with stereotype embodiment theory () and supported by empirical findings (e.g., ), age stereotypes are learned and internalized during youth, accumulate over the life span, and become SPA when they are directed at oneself and the own aging process with increasing age. Changes in SPA can be investigated from two perspectives: intraindividual and social change. A recent study on social change in SPA in the German population between 1996 and 2014 showed that SPA have improved in persons aged 40–85 years (). Longitudinal studies on intraindividual changes in SPA with age are rare (e.g., ) but show, in line with cross-sectional age group comparisons, that older individuals report more negative SPA than younger individuals (e.g., ).Intraindividual and social change of age stereotypes and SPA can be influenced by individual factors such as socioeconomic variables (e.g., ), health status (e.g., ; ), personality (e.g., ; ; ), and own and vicarious aging experiences, such as receipt of care (e.g., ). Contextual influences may be defined as “(…) the totality of the diverse range of phenomena, events, and forces that exist outside the developing individual, including its sociocultural and physical aspects” (, p. 84). Additionally, the environment a person lives in changes over time (), and, according to the ecological systems theory () and the cross-level dynamic biocultural coconstructive framework of development (), contextual variables influence behavior and attitudes of individuals.Empirically, contextual variables such as the portrayal of age and older adults in the media (e.g., ), age-graded social regulations such as retirement (e.g., ), or the societal roles of older adults (e.g., ) have been shown to play a role in shaping age stereotypes and their internalization into SPA. However, even though many western societies face demographic changes, characteristics of population aging at the regional level have been rarely examined as contextual influences on SPA. Population Aging and SPAWhile the effect of population aging on SPA has not been examined so far, first evidence suggests that population aging affects age stereotypes and attitudes towards aging. A comparison of eastern and western cultures showed overall more favorable age stereotypes in western cultures (e.g., ; ), which seems to be accounted for by differences in population aging (see meta-analysis by  for details).  showed that individuals living in countries with rapid population aging, which is true for most eastern countries, have more negative age stereotypes. In a similar vein,  compared aging perceptions of mostly younger adults in 26 countries and found that countries with a higher proportion of inhabitants aged 65+ had more negative perceptions of aging. These findings, however, contradict the assumption of the contact hypothesis (cf. ; ), which suggests that having more contact with a group of people will result in reduced prejudices towards that group. That is, individuals living in contexts with comparatively more older adults should have fewer prejudices toward older adults, which could, in turn, be associated with decreased negative age stereotypes. However, these studies focused on age stereotypes or attitudes toward aging and did not investigate how an individual perceives his or her own aging process.Regarding the relation between population aging and SPA, there are good arguments for both more positive and more negative SPA due to population aging: On the one hand, increased contact with older adults due to living in an area with a larger older adult population could reduce negative SPA as population aging may enhance the likelihood of experiencing healthy older adults, who actively participate in society. On the other hand, population aging can impose threats and challenges on a society. For example, anticipated problems in distributive justice of health care and pension systems, increased care needs of old-old individuals, or the financial burden of younger family members or the younger generation in general may result in more negative age stereotypes and SPA. In particular, rapid population aging may hamper adaptation to these changes.  argue that a greater proportion of older adults may result in intergenerational conflict over limited resources.  state that age structure drives the demand for services (e.g., health clinics) and infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks) as well as fostering expectations about social roles (e.g., informal monitoring of children) that may affect social contact and cohesion in neighborhoods.  found that a high number of aged residents is associated with a more active neighborhood watch, better social services, and, in general, a community more engaged in civic affairs.Furthermore, social characteristics on a regional level affect individuals via informal social control (e.g., monitoring, expectations for action, availability of role models; cf. ; ). These changes in infrastructure and norms may provide more opportunities for intergenerational contact resulting in stronger social cohesion. For example, increased intergenerational contact due to a community program was already shown to result in more positive images of aging in fourth grade students (even though no effect was found for negative images of aging; ).A country level perspective, however, ignores heterogeneity in population aging within a country. Aspects of population aging, such as increases in the proportion of elderly population, do not happen in the same manner in all geographical regions of one country (). In addition, regional patterns of population aging affect more directly the immediate environment where people live as well as the perception of older people and may, therefore, have stronger effects on SPA. In Germany, districts are responsible for various infrastructural aspects, such as establishing economic infrastructures, planning for housing areas, providing health care services, and offering opportunities for volunteering. Previous research has largely neglected regional differences in population aging, age stereotypes, and SPA, even though there are some hints of regional differences in age stereotypes for example between urban and rural areas (favoring rural areas; ). Thus, the analysis of population aging at the district-level provides additional information to previous studies on country-level aging: First, the heterogeneity of population aging within one country is captured, and, second, this perspective takes into account that age stereotypes and SPA emerge under specific regional circumstances of social, economic, and cultural life. The Present StudyNo study has thus far examined the impact of population aging on SPA. The present study therefore explores the question whether district level differences in population aging in Germany explain changes in SPA. Population aging is an interaction of different demographic factors and a complex phenomenon that cannot be captured sufficiently with single indicators, such as percentage of older adults (as used in most of the previous studies). Therefore, we decided to use four clusters reflecting differences in indicators of population aging (e.g., average age; proportion of very old individuals [80+] at district level) were used in the analyses (see Method section for details; ).The clusters should explain variability in change in two different facets of SPA: the experience of aging as both ongoing development and physical loss. These two facets capture two important dimensions of the multidimensional construct of SPA (cf. ; ; ). Ongoing development describes the belief that aging is accompanied with new opportunities and one is still making new plans. Chances for ongoing development are affected by contextual factors such as opportunities for leisure or other activities. The second facet captures the common belief that aging is strongly associated with physical loss. This loss-related view might also be prone to contextual influences, for example, in terms of environments equipped for older and functional disabled persons.This study examines population aging at the district level and changes in two facets of SPA across 12 years using data from a large representative survey of adults aged 40 years and older in Germany to answer the research question: Do different regional patterns of population aging influence changes in SPA? Design and MethodsSampleData come from two measurement points (1996, 2008) of the German Ageing Survey (DEutscher AltersSurvey [DEAS]; ). DEAS is a national representative cohort-sequential study of adults aged 40 years and older. Cross-sectional baseline samples have been drawn every 6 years since 1996 and are stratified by age, gender, and region (Eastern/Western Germany). The sampling procedure of the DEAS starts with randomly drawn municipalities, in which stratified samples are randomly drawn from registry offices. Thereby, the sample is representative of the German population, with only a subsample of all 413 German districts in the data. At each measurement point, participants took part in a 90-min interview and filled in a paper-pencil questionnaire.The current study combines cross-sectional and longitudinal information from two measurement points (t1: 1996 and t2: 2008; see ) to assess a combination of social change (between baseline samples of 1996 and 2008) and intraindividual change (between t1 [1996] and t2 [2008]) in SPA. The 1996 sample data represents a baseline at t1 (n = 4,838). The 2008 sample includes both baseline data from additional participants (n = 6,205) as well as the longitudinal data from the 1996 participants. Due to political reforms that led to changes in the number of districts in Germany, 155 persons had to be excluded because they could not be clearly assigned to one of the clusters (n1996 = 32; n2008 = 123). As SPA were assessed in the paper-pencil questionnaire, only participants who completed the questionnaire were included in the analyses: Of the remaining sample from 1996, n = 797 persons did not fill-in the paper-pencil questionnaire in 1996 and n = 148 in 2008. Of the remaining sample in 2008, n = 1,699 participants had to be excluded due to missing paper-pencil questionnaires. Additionally, we excluded all persons who moved between districts between measurement points (n = 45 of the 1996 sample). The analyzed sample in 1996 includes 3,816 persons. The analyzed sample in 2008 consists of 5,122 persons, including information from the 2008 baseline sample (n = 4,383) and longitudinal information from the 1996 sample (n = 739). Thus, a total sample of n = 8,199 was analyzed. Of the 413 districts in Germany, 207 are represented in the data. On average, 40 persons lived in each district.

MeasuresDemographic ClustersFour clusters differing in their pace of population aging were identified by a cluster analysis () aimed at describing population aging in all German districts based on the following indicators: (a) population development per 1,000 inhabitants between 1995 and 2008, (b) average age of population in 2008, (c) percentage of population aged 65+ in 1995, (d) percentage of population aged 65+ in 2008, (e) greying index (old-old population, aged 80+ years, in relation to young-old, aged 65–79 years) in 2008, and (f) balance of births and deaths per 1,000 inhabitants in 2008. The average values of these indicators from each cluster for all German districts are summarized in  and described below. Table 1.Cluster Indicators of Population Aging in Germany (average values, 413 districts in 2008)  Cluster 1 (C1; fast aging; 2008: highest average age/low proportion of 80+)Cluster 1 comprises districts with a rapidly aging, shrinking population. All districts in this cluster are located in Eastern Germany. In the past, these districts had a relatively young population structure. Since 1995 they have been confronted with population decline and an accelerated aging process. The average age in 2008 is the highest of all clusters. The percentage of people aged 65+ is above average, although the percentage of people aged 80+ is the smallest among all clusters. In this study, 42 districts with 2,084 participants belong to C1. Cluster 2 (C2; slow aging; 2008: lowest average age/low proportion of 80+)The districts of this cluster are mostly situated in urban agglomerations and are characterized by a slowly aging, growing population. The population has been increasing since 1995, mostly due to internal migration. The average age in 2008 is lower than the average for Germany. Moreover, the percentages of people aged 65+ or 80+ are low in comparison to the other clusters. The districts of C2 have stable and growing populations. Demographic change is occurring at a much slower pace. In this study, 53 districts with 2,266 participants belong to C2. Cluster 3 (C3; average aging; 2008: high average age/high proportion of 80+)This cluster comprises districts with a slowly aging, shrinking population. All districts in this cluster are located in Western Germany. Population aging in this cluster has progressed considerably: In contrast to C1 it started with a much older population in 1995; since then, the pace of population aging has been slower than in C1. The percentage of the population aged 65+ is higher than on average. The greying index is the highest of all clusters in 2008. In this study, 31 districts and 849 participants belong to C3. Cluster 4 (C4; average aging; 2008: average age/average proportion of 80+)Cluster 4 consists of districts with an average rate of population aging. The vast majority of districts in this cluster are situated in Western Germany. They are characterized by a medium pace of population aging and minimal population growth since 1995. Most of the indicators of population aging are close to the average for Germany. In this study, 81 districts and 3,000 participants belong to C4.For the analyses, the clusters were dummy coded using C4 as reference category as it represents average population aging in Germany. SPATwo scales of SPA were assessed in 1996 and 2008 with subscales for the aging-related cognition of ongoing development and physical loss (AgeCog-Scales; ; ). The SPA ongoing development consists of four items and refers to the positive view that aging is seen as a time of continuous personal development (e.g., “Aging means to me that I can still learn new things,” “Aging means to me that my capabilities are increasing”; Cronbach’s α1996 = .91; Cronbach’s α2008 = .93). The SPA physical losses consists of four items and addresses the view that aging is accompanied by physical decline (e.g., “Aging means to me that I am less healthy,” “Aging means to me that I am less energetic and fit”; Cronbach’s α1996 = .91; Cronbach’s α2008 = .91). Responses could range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). For each scale, the four items were averaged to obtain a score, with higher values indicating greater agreement. That is, a higher SPA score for ongoing development indicates a more positive view, and a higher SPA score for physical losses indicates a more negative view. Covariates (individual)Covariates on the individual level were age, gender, and region (Eastern/Western Germany) as the DEAS sample is stratified by theses variables and to account for age-related differences in SPA. As more healthy and highly educated people are known to report more positive SPA, analyses were also controlled for education. This was assessed using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED with three levels; ). The three levels are: low education (9 years of school education at most), medium education (secondary school), and high education (qualifying for university admission). Additionally, the health status of the participants was controlled for using both self-reported numbers of physical diseases (up to 11 diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, back or joint diseases, respiratory diseases) and functional health (physical functioning subscale of the SF-36 questionaire; ). The latter was coded according to the manual, with values ranging from 1 to 100 and higher values indicating better functional health. Values of these covariates are based on the first assessment point of each participant. Covariates (district)The variables included as covariates are indicators of the wealth and health care opportunities of the district, which have been shown to be related to SPA and psychological resources (). On a district level, all analyses were controlled for using the percentage of unemployed older workers (55–65 years) from all unemployed persons (M [SD] = 13.56 [2.31]), primary care supply (number of general practitioners per 100,000 inhabitants; M [SD] = 673.30 [179.51]), gross domestic product (GDP in 1000 Euro per capita; M [SD] = 28.66 [12.37]), and population density (number of residents per km2; M [SD] = 749.82 [967.97]) in 2008. In addition, the analyses were controlled for using the district level average remaining life expectancy for 60-year-old persons between 2007 and 2009 (M [SD] = 23.21 [0.74]). Primary care supply, GDP, and population density were divided by 100 before including them in the analyses to facilitate the estimation of the models. Data AnalysesThe data has a three-level structure with time on Level 1, individuals on Level 2, and districts on Level 3. Therefore, a three-level latent change model was used to analyze the data in Mplus (adapted from ). Within-person change in SPA across 12 years was modeled, allowing for individual and district-level differences in this change as well as in intercept. Change in SPA ongoing development and SPA physical losses were estimated in two separate models. The intercept was modeled to represent levels at 2008 allowing for testing level differences in SPA in 2008. Intercepts and change scores were predicted by the cluster dummies (C4 as reference) and all covariates. Estimation was conducted with full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) to account for longitudinal drop-out in the sample (cf. ). Significance level was set to .05. All Level 2 variables were group-mean centered. All Level 3 variables were grand-mean centered. Covariates were allowed to covary on individual and district level. To ensure model identification, the residual variances of SPA ongoing development and SPA physical losses were set zero for 1996, and the intercept and change scores were not allowed to covary on individual level. ResultsDescriptive StatisticsThe average age at first measurement point was 61.06 years (SD = 12.05, range: 40–85 years) and 48.70% were female. Of all participants, 12.96% had low, 56.04% medium, and 31.00% high-level education. On average, the score on the physical functioning subscale of the SF-36 was M (SD) = 83.99 (22.37) and participants reported 2.41 diseases (SD = 1.87). SPA Ongoing DevelopmentThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC: the proportion of variance on district level to total variance) for SPA ongoing development was .05 and .06 in 1996 and 2008, respectively. The results of the multilevel model are summarized in . Table 2.Unstandardized Parameters of Multilevel Latent Change Model for SPA Ongoing Development using DEAS Data From 1996 to 2008 Note: DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; GDP = Gross domestic product; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.In 2008, the average value of SPA ongoing development was 2.95 in the reference group (C4). Individuals living in C1 reported a lower level of SPA ongoing development than C4 (bC1 = −0.10, p = .01). C2 as well as C3 had a similar level compared to C4 because there was no significant difference in the intercept (bC2 = 0.03, p = .50; bC3 = 0.01, p = .88). The cluster variables explained 4.55% of the district-level variance in the intercept.Regarding changes from 1996 to 2008 (see ), the average value of SPA ongoing development remained stable over time in the reference group C4 (change = −0.03, p = .30). C1 and C3 did not differ from C4 in changes of SPA ongoing development (bC1 = −0.04, p = .38; bC3 = −0.04, p = .46), meaning SPA also remained stable over time in C1 and C3. Change over time differed between C2 and the reference group C4, as indicated by the significant effects of C2 on the change score (bC2 = −0.10, p = .03). That is, individuals living in C2 reported more positive SPA in 2008 than in 1996. The cluster variables explained 9.09% of the district-level slope variance. Figure 2.Change in SPA ongoing development from 1996 to 2008 in clusters of population aging using DEAS data. DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.Figure 2.Change in SPA ongoing development from 1996 to 2008 in clusters of population aging using DEAS data. DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.In sum, C1 showed the lowest levels of SPA ongoing development, meaning more negative SPA were reported in C1 as compared to the other clusters in 2008. Only C2 showed a significant increase in SPA ongoing development over time. The other clusters remained stable. SPA Physical LossesResults of the multilevel model for SPA physical losses are shown in . The ICC was .02 for SPA physical losses in 1996 and .04 in 2008. Table 3.Unstandardized Parameters of Multilevel Latent Change Model for SPA Physical Losses using DEAS Data From 1996 to 2008 Note: DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; GDP = Gross domestic product; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.In 2008, the average value of SPA physical loss was 2.65 in the reference group (C4). C2 and C3 did not differ in intercept from C4 (bC2 = 0.004, p = .89; bC3 = 0.02, p = .58), which means that individuals living in C2 and C3 reported similar levels for SPA physical losses, compared to individuals living in C4. However, C1 had higher levels of SPA physical losses in 2008 as compared to C4, as indicated by a significant effect of C1 on the intercept (b = 0.09, p = .01). In total, 7.69% of the intercept variance was explained by the cluster variables.Regarding changes from 1996 to 2008 (see ), the average value of SPA physical losses remained stable over time in the reference group (change = −0.004, p = .90). Figure 3.Change in SPA physical losses from 1996 to 2008 in clusters of population aging using DEAS data. DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.Figure 3.Change in SPA physical losses from 1996 to 2008 in clusters of population aging using DEAS data. DEAS = DEutscher AltersSurvey; SPA = Self-perceptions of aging.None of the other clusters differed in change over time from C4 (bC1 = −0.04, p = .44; bC2 = 0.05, p = .22; bC3 = −0.06, p = .28), indicating no significant change in SPA physical losses between 1996 and 2008 in C1, C2, or C3.In sum, C1 showed higher levels of SPA physical losses, which indicates more negative SPA in C1 as compared to the other clusters. SPA physical losses did not change over time in all clusters. DiscussionThis study is one of the first to investigate regional differences in SPA development by referring to population aging on a district level. Two different SPA were examined: Associating the own aging process with either ongoing development or with physical losses. Results show that population aging influenced the level of and changes in the SPA ongoing development as well as level in the SPA physical losses, whereas population aging did not predict change in the SPA physical losses. Consistently, individuals living in districts characterized by a fast aging population, high average age, and low proportion of 80+ (C1) reported more negative SPA for both facets in 2008. Change in SPA physical losses was not associated with differences in population aging, but individuals living in districts with slow population aging, low average age, and low proportion of 80+ (C2) showed a more positive development of SPA ongoing development over time as compared to individuals living in regions with average population aging (C4).In line with the findings of , results suggest that persons have more negative SPA if they live in regions where population aging happens faster. A relatively fast change in the composition of a population may affect the perception of how well needs are met in regard to local circumstances. Changes in leisure time facilities, or regarding health care (e.g., because of retiring General Practitioners) and also the mere age-related changes in the social structure of the neighborhood may affect the living conditions of older adults in these areas and pronounce negative aspects and barriers in old age, resulting in more negative perceptions of aging. Investing in infrastructure and in leisure time facilities for older persons may contribute to the perception of having opportunities for ongoing development in old age among the inhabitants of these regions. However, to accomplish this, regions need to have sufficient financial and economic strength. Fast population aging in combination with low economic strength may even amplify negative changes in SPA. On an individual level, it has already been shown that financial resources make a difference for SPA and their consequences ().  also demonstrated that social integration of older adults is associated with characteristics of neighborhoods, such as socioeconomic status, ageism, or perceived limitations of outdoor mobility, in Tel-Aviv. There is, however, a need for more studies investigating the interplay of contextual variables and psychological phenomena.Also, positive effects of regional characteristics on SPA were observed in this study. Persons living in regions with slow population aging (e.g., relatively low average age and small proportion of old-old adults) as compared to the German average showed a positive development in their SPA ongoing development. Possibly, these regions are able to better adapt to a slowly growing number of older adults as compared to regions with faster population aging. A lower proportion of older adults, and in particular of old-old adults, may result in fewer negative role models and, therefore, more positive SPA. This would be in line with research showing, that perception of older adults depends on societal roles of older adults: Older persons are perceived as more competent in countries with a higher proportion of older adults participating in paid and volunteer work (). In particular, regions with higher proportions of healthy older adults may benefit from these positive effects. Additionally, social contact and cohesion may be different in those communities where the population structure has been shifted gradually over time. As suggested in the model by , intergenerational interactions may shape development of individuals. Future research should investigate which mechanisms might underlie this relationship.Change in SPA physical losses, in contrast, was not affected by population aging as operationalized in the clusters.  argue that context effects are strongest for the aspects of aging perceptions that are least influenced by age-related biological changes, which was supported by the finding that physical perceptions of aging were less related to country level indicators than other facets such as socioemotional or family-related views of aging. Possibly, expectations of physical loss with aging are more likely to be influenced by individual factors such as health behaviors or health events than by contextual circumstances.In sum, our findings add to the previous research by extending what has been shown for age stereotypes in different countries (cf. ): Population aging is associated with changes in self-perceptions of aging. To some extent, results contradict the prediction of the contact hypothesis (cf. ; ). However, little is known about mechanisms of population aging on social contact and cohesion. For instance,  found that a higher proportion of older adults in the population was not related to more frequent intergenerational contact with young adults. LimitationsAlthough population aging can be considered similar in different districts of the same cluster, this does not imply that other environmental variables such as infrastructure or opportunities for leisure and engagement are similar. The district-level is the smallest regional level with available data on population aging in Germany. Nevertheless, living conditions within one district can differ to a considerable extent. In addition, individuals may differ in the degree of use of services provided by neighboring regions, and consequently may be more or less exposed to the population composition. However, this limitation speaks for less strong contextual effects and therefore even underlines the small but significant effects of differences in population aging on SPA found in this study.Generalizations of results to other than German regions should be drawn with caution. In particular, country-specific age stereotypes and country-specific legislations (e.g., welfare state) may drive some of the observed results. In addition, countries may differ in social change of SPA (Germany shows a positive pattern over time; ) which may affect the results. Future studies should compare regions with similar population aging patterns between different countries.The clusters used reflect a share of different population aging processes. It remains unclear, if certain aspects are more strongly related to SPA than others. A high proportion of old-old people may challenge regions differently as compared to a high proportion of young-old people. In addition, other regional aspects, not reflected in the clusters, may be relevant for the SPA of the inhabitants.This study combines the investigation of social and intraindividual change in a sample with a broad age range (40–85 years). Even though FIML counteracts the effects of sample attrition, interpretations regarding intraindividual change in SPA should be made with caution. However, the combination of social and intraindividual change has the advantage of a large sample adequately representing districts and the four clusters in Germany as well as reflecting the effects of population aging over 12 years for both social and intraindividual changes in SPA.Furthermore, there might be time periods in which contextual factors have a stronger effect on individual SPA (e.g., availability of health care institutions after a health event; engagement opportunities after retirement). Continuous, closely-timed SPA assessment may help capture those time periods and allow the identification of potential intervention targets.Although indicators of wealth and health care opportunities were included as covariates, underlying mechanisms, such as leisure opportunities and economic living conditions in the districts were not fully captured in our model and may drive the random effects of the multilevel models. Future studies should additionally try to capture these district characteristics to further explain the district level variance in level and change of SPA. ConclusionAs most societies face population aging, it is important to investigate its effects on individual development and aging. The current study focuses on contextual effects on self-perceptions of aging as one important psychological resource for health, well-being and longevity in later life. Results suggest that SPA do not develop independently from population aging on the district level. Rather, the pace of population aging in different regions of one single country can contribute to individual changes in positive and negative SPA. This finding complements previous cross-cultural comparisons. Districts facing fast population aging should address possible negative effects by providing attractive opportunities for families with young children, by increasing efforts to maintain and improve good infrastructure (e.g., public transport, health care, and shopping facilities), and by providing opportunities for intergenerational contact and mutual support. Additionally, health communication and public health messages that emphasize positive aspects of aging (e.g., wisdom, positive older role models) may counteract negative effects of fast population aging. Results imply that regional differences and potential contextual opportunities for aging well should be taken into account when trying to promote positive perceptions of aging.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesOlder adults are at greater risk than other age groups throughout all stages of a disaster. To date, the bulk of empirical disaster research concerning older adults has centered on the consequences of a disaster. This study focuses on older residents in a hurricane-prone community and investigates the extent and level of their reported preparedness for hurricanes, which takes place prior to a disaster.Research Design and MethodsThis study engaged year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 older individuals of 60–90 years of age. Transcripts were analyzed by qualitative content analysis integrating both inductive and deductive coding approaches.ResultsOlder respondents overwhelmingly practiced survival preparedness by only storing water and food supplies, but lacked efforts in planning and structural preparedness due to insufficient awareness and financial resources. Most respondents asserted hurricane readiness despite the shortage of preparation practices because “being prepared” is defined differently for different individuals. Many respondents claimed hurricane experience and subjective interpretation rather than objective nature of prior exposure appeared to have a greater influence over respondents’ reported preparedness behavior.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study adds to the emerging, but highly limited body of work specifically addressing disaster preparedness among older adults. The interview data inclusive of respondents’ voices and values suggest that expectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. More practical and age-specific interventions are needed to promote disaster preparedness of older adults. , , , Disaster preparedness refers to preparation practices taken prior to a disaster in order to minimize potential loss and devastation from the disaster (). Although disaster preparedness involves key actors across different levels, preparedness efforts that occur at the smallest unit are fundamentally important to self-sufficiency if external assistance becomes unavailable (; ; ). Despite the value of personal preparedness reiterated by researchers and practitioners, the U.S. public is overall underprepared for disasters, lacking a complete set of emergency essentials, an evacuation plan, or a family emergency communication plan (; ; ).Numerous research efforts have been devoted to understanding what motivates or impedes preparation actions and accounts for the variations in level of disaster preparedness. It has been well recognized that personal preparedness is a product of multiple influences (; ; ). Irrespective of the type of hazard under consideration, scholars have consistently concluded that income level and educational attainment are positively associated with preparedness behavior (e.g., ; ; ; ; ). In recent years, high stocks of social capital have been increasingly treated as a facilitator of disaster preparation actions and climate change adaptation (; ; ).In contrast, the influence of experiential factors on personal preparedness appears less uniform. Although some researchers have suggested that hazard experience enhances preparedness (e.g., ; ), others have argued that the influence is not absolutely positive but contingent on the nature of the experience (e.g., ; ; ; ; ). To illustrate, in the context of hurricane preparedness, multiple exposures to near-misses lulled people into a sense of complacency, making them underestimate the need for extensive preparations as they assumed future hurricanes would be of similar character and consequence (e.g., ). Here, the “emotional experience” of hazards mediated by subjective perceptions serves as an important aspect of preparedness, pointing to the possibility that basic orientations toward oneself (e.g., self-efficacy) and the world (e.g., perceived risk and vulnerability) influence individuals’ preparedness behavior (; Sattler et al., ).Researchers have also attempted to understand personal preparedness in relation to demographic characteristics but findings have been mixed. For example, some have suggested that greater disaster preparedness is positively related with age (e.g., ; ; ), whereas others have argued that preparedness declines with age after a certain age threshold (e.g., ; ). Another emerging but limited branch of research on the age effect centers on the preparedness of the older population. Results from the United States and international survey samples have demonstrated that older adults are minimally prepared for disasters (e.g., ; ; ). Nevertheless, as noted earlier, preparedness efforts are defined by multiple variables beyond chronological age. Older adults might be less likely to engage in preparedness behavior because they could have accumulated more near-misses given their greater life experience and thus a growing sense of complacency eroding their disaster readiness.It is noteworthy that quantitative methods have long dominated disaster research, in which researchers examine population characteristics and make statistical inferences about motivations for and barriers to behaviors based on these parameters (). However, the lack of systematic conclusions from limited literature directly addressing older adults’ disaster preparedness provides no foundation to formulate meaningful hypotheses. Although qualitative studies are not designed to make statistical generalizations, they are well-suited to illuminate the concerns with personal knowledge and subjective experience () to provide a more sensitive picture of vulnerable populations, such as older adults, at risk from hazardous events (). As the world’s population ages rapidly and evidence of elder vulnerability to disasters continues to accumulate (; ; ), more age-specific analyses using more contextual methodological approaches are much needed to expand and enrich our understanding of older adults’ disaster preparedness, which if well-planned and -managed, can reduce vulnerability.These issues lead to the formulation of this study, which performs qualitative interviews with older residents in a hurricane-prone community—Sarasota County, Florida—and asks three research questions. First, what hurricane preparedness activities have the respondents implemented? Second, do the respondents think they are prepared for hurricanes? Third, in what ways might hurricane experience have influenced hurricane preparedness of the respondents? Section 2 details the study area and research methods. Section 3 discusses the findings regarding hurricane preparedness, readiness, and role of experience in preparedness efforts. Section 4 recapitulates the major findings of each subtopic and concludes with the political implications of the study as well as the avenues for future research. Research Design and MethodsStudy AreaThis study presents a case study of older residents in Sarasota County, Florida, and utilizes qualitative interviews to explore their hurricane preparedness and other related topics. Sarasota (This research adopts the practice of local residents of referring to Sarasota County as simply, “Sarasota.”) sits on the southwestern Gulf Coast of Florida (see ). It is a suitable study site given its location in an active hurricane zone and its skew toward an older population. At the time of this writing, one in three Sarasota County residents are 65 years and older (); the county has reached a median age of 54.2, which is among the highest in the nation (). Although Sarasota has been spared extensive and significant damage from recent major storms that visited Florida’s west coast, its exposure to future hurricanes remains (). Concern lingers that the county’s hurricane quiescence through the 1950s and up to the present has eliminated social memory of strong storms and fostered a sense of complacency (). Local authorities have thus been trying to raise hurricane hazard awareness and strongly advising its residents to practice hurricane preparedness. Figure 1.Sarasota County, Florida.Figure 1.Sarasota County, Florida. Data Collection and AnalysisThis study takes an individual focus on older adults and is exploratory in nature. From October 28 to November 6, 2014, a total of 30 semi-structured interviews were completed. Specifically, I prepared an interview guide of primary questions to be covered in the interviews and gathered self-reported data and firsthand insights with regard to three central topics (hurricane preparation practices, hurricane readiness, and hurricane experience) from the respondents. Follow-up questions (i.e., prompts) were generated in situ to elicit elaboration or clarification. Subjects were informed of the study and their rights and signed informed consent forms before the interviews could proceed.The interviews were conducted in English and audio-recorded. Each of the interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes. The interviews took place at the Friendship Center near the downtown of the City of Sarasota. The choice of space and time embodies a deliberate effort for screening subjects. First, the Friendship Center by nature attracts older individuals who stay active and mentally healthy, so the spot for the interviews helped select subjects who are mobile and independent and who, therefore, are likely to engage in hurricane preparedness and make hurricane evacuation decisions. Second, the timing of the interviews excluded “snowbirds,” a group of older adults that only resides in Sarasota during winter, when hurricanes do not occur, and that do not need to prepare for them or make evacuation decisions.The resulting sample is nonrepresentative and skewed by a combination of self-selection and the demographics of older individuals who participate in the activities and services of the Friendship Center. To illustrate, although the spread of attributes such as chronological age, education attainment, and income level were effectively accounted (see ), minorities were underrepresented in the sample. Only two African Americans and one of other race were involved due to two facts: first, Sarasota’s population is predominately white (90.2% white, 4.7% black; ); second, Sarasota’s African Americans tend to concentrate in Newtown, a Jim Crow era black enclave, and prefer a counterpart to the downtown Friendship Centers located there. Table 1.Sample Characteristics When I returned from the interview-based fieldwork, each interview was transcribed verbatim and saved as a separate document along with the associated in-field notes and reflections. I then uploaded the 30 transcripts to Atlas.ti and conducted qualitative content analysis to identify common themes or patterns in the transcripts (; ). I applied both inductive and deductive approaches to the analysis (). On the one hand, I directly drew from the transcripts and looked for open codes because prior knowledge regarding older adults and hurricane preparedness is limited and inconsistent. On the other hand, I borrowed preconceived codes from the literature of natural hazards and disasters for the general public to apply them to a specific context (i.e., hurricanes) and population (i.e., older adults). ResultsHurricane Preparation PracticesDuring the interviews, the older respondents freely recalled any preparations that they had done for future hurricanes. Among the named preparations of 24 respondents (see  [The word cloud was generated in Wordle (), in which words or phrases that occur more often are made larger in size and given greater prominence.] and ), “water” and “food” were the most prominent elements, being mentioned by over half of the respondents. A quarter of the respondents nominated “flashlights,” making this key safety item secondary to water and food supplies. In the research area of disaster preparedness, scholars (e.g., ; ) have structured practical preparedness into three conceptual dimensions: (1) survival preparedness, which refers to stockpiling of supplies and resources for the purpose of survival; (2) planning preparedness, which refers to planning activities and allocating resources; and (3) structural preparedness, which refers to home protection, maintenance, and reinforcement. Given the taxonomy in the literature, it is clear that survival preparedness has monopolized most of the preparedness efforts among the older respondents for hurricanes. Figure 2.Hurricane preparation practices of older residents of Sarasota County.Figure 2.Hurricane preparation practices of older residents of Sarasota County. Table 2.A Ranked List of Hurricane Preparation Practices of Older Residents of Sarasota County Note. A total of 24 respondents were considered. Those with no preparations at all (six respondents) were excluded in the presentation.Planning and structural preparedness actions were poorly represented among the respondents. Few have formulated plans for evacuation and communication during hurricanes (typical examples of planning preparedness). The importance of staying in touch with children or friends particularly for those who expected evacuation rides only became apparent after being prompted. For example, as I painted the scenario of electricity disruptions during storms, one responded, “Yeah, that’s a big deal. My daughter knows that I’m okay, providing the phone lines are working. But if it’s not …” In these cases, lack of awareness impedes planning actions and external advice is required. Similarly, few respondents have practiced structural preparedness to make their homes hurricane-resistant. Financial constraints turned out to be a big hurdle to overcome for performing this kind of actions. For example, one said, “Trimming the trees in my yard will require a lot of money.” Another said, “I don’t have that kind of financial abilities to replace the old roof with a better one.”The remaining six respondents relied on “just-in-time” preparedness and even have yet to stock up on water and food to meet basic needs in hurricanes. To quote directly from one of these respondents, “I hardly have anything because people wait. Once we get the warning, you prepare. While they say a hurricane is here, a hurricane is there, but they never say a hurricane is hitting Sarasota when you have to prepare.”The sense of no urgency is in essence a sense of complacency that makes these people wait until a hurricane is imminent to prepare. Self-Reported Hurricane ReadinessNineteen of the 30 respondents claimed themselves to be hurricane-prepared. Three of them eloquently justified the claims by reporting a portfolio of preparation practices in place across different types of preparedness: survival, planning, and/or structural. The other 16 respondents, however, conveyed a sense of fulfillment despite the gaps in their status quo of preparedness. Grounded in the narratives, I propose four conceptual models to help understand why these respondents made optimistically biased evaluations and asserted hurricane readiness. Readiness as a FeelingEight respondents claimed hurricane readiness although their preparedness efforts took place only at the most rudimentary level. One gave a typical account of this, “I just feel like I am really prepared. I have extra food in the house, I have water. That’s it.” Like this man, a group of the respondents took one less-laborious action (e.g., assembling food and water supplies) and believed it would suffice in reducing vulnerability to hurricanes. The phenomenon of simplifying the procedures of hurricane preparedness to one task relates to the “single action bias”, which describes the tendency of people to count on one action in response to potential threats in different contexts (, ). In the circumstance of hurricane preparedness, some of the older respondents are less likely to take additional steps once they have taken one action to reduce their vulnerability. Readiness as an Attitude Towards LifeThis cognitive operation is best illustrated by two respondents in their eighties or nineties. One said: “I’m prepared for everything, really. I’ve been prepared all my life. How much time do I have left? You know it’s hard for a hurricane being the biggest catastrophe... Anybody that survived two wars and the Great Depression can pretty much take care of themselves.” Indeed, people who have lived through many stressful things are less likely to be motivated to prepare for hurricanes that might or might not happen during their remaining years in very old age. The older-old adults see themselves as prepared for whatever life will bring. The other added, “I don’t think I would have a problem for quite a while…We have different feelings about where we are in our lives. If it gets to that point, then sayonara.” It can be inferred that for this subgroup, if they were to perish in a hurricane, they might consider it their time to go rather than the result of insufficient preparations. Readiness as a Pure Mental ConstructTo four respondents, being hurricane-prepared primarily means being emotionally ready and mentally able to react if a storm were to hit, with or without practical preparations. For example, one woman has prepared a will, a weather radio, water, canned goods, flashlights, blankets, identified a safe spot inside her home if she needs to shelter in place, and determined a destination if she needs to evacuate. Nevertheless, she gave no credit to these practices but instead made her judgment solely based on her mental readiness: “Yes, I’m prepared. My mind is set for a hurricane. I want to stay in that mode so I don’t lose the information that I really need.” The other respondents with no preparations applied the same model when they claimed to be hurricane-prepared. Although the “it’s-all-in-my-head” model might be powerful in buffering emotional distress from a hurricane, these respondents could experience difficulty recovering from physical losses due to the absence or insufficiency of practical preparedness. Readiness as a State of Social EmbeddednessHurricane readiness in this model shifted from an individual attribute to a relational property consisting of social ties, as two respondents explained in their account: “I have a group of friends that would check on each other.” “My children would call to check on me and offer a ride for evacuation.” These respondents averted the reflection on what they as individuals had done for hurricanes; rather, they focused the connectivity of themselves to other people when claiming hurricane readiness. Normally social support that is inherent in social ties helps cushion the impacts of a stressful event (e.g., ; ), as personal preparedness is supposed to do. However, greater perceived social support prior to a disaster may lead to adverse effects if it becomes challenging to mobilize these social resources in a disaster as families and neighborhoods are ripped apart and scattered (e.g., ; ). Hence, if being prepared is dependent on being social embedded, then hurricane readiness becomes a highly situational and unreliable condition depending on whether a person’s need for social support can be satisfied during and after the event. Hurricane Experience and PreparednessPerceptions of Hurricane ExperiencesSixteen out of the 30 respondents claimed that they had personally experienced hurricanes in places they had lived or visited (see ). Hurricane Charley is the most recent and most cited storm because by 2004, many of the respondents had moved from different places to settle in Sarasota. In 2004, Sarasota had a near-miss with Hurricane Charley (). “A storm was going to hit the place about ten years ago but finally landed in Punta Gorda [a city in Charlotte County on Sarasota’s southern border]. They first said it was gonna hit towards Tampa, the Big Bend, and all of the sudden it veered off and it missed us but it hit our neighbor. I remember it hit them bad,” said one respondent. Like this man, another seven respondents repeated the story and claimed personal experience of Hurricane Charley despite not actually coming in contact with the storm.  hosts a collection of maps that illustrate how far out the respondents were from the “centers” of the named storms, corroborating previous findings (; ) that the majority of hurricane-experienced people are on the fringe of the storms (within the 100–200 km buffer zones). Table 3.A Storm Chronology Derived From the Interview Transcripts Notes. Information was insufficient to determine which storm (Connie or Diane) one respondent experienced in 1955. Entries in the Frequency of Mention column do not add up to 16 because one respondent could have multiple exposure to different storms and one storm could be experienced by multiple respondents. Figure 3.Proximity to centers of hurricanes in prior exposure.Figure 3.Proximity to centers of hurricanes in prior exposure.Weathering the StormAnother major pattern surfaced during the queries about hurricane experience: among those who claimed personal experience of hurricanes, all but three respondents had suffered neither personal injury nor severe property damage from past storms. The three exceptions all involved a direct hit and severe harm to the respondents. One respondent was within 10 kilometers of Hurricane Flora’s path as the storm passed over Tobago as a Category 3 hurricane. Flora destroyed her house, forcing the family to move from Tobago to Trinidad. In the second case, one respondent was less than 25 kilometers from the center of Hurricane Andrew. The destructive Category 5 hurricane devastated her house in Kendall, Florida, and took her car. In the third exception, one respondent in Jacksonville, Florida, was about 50 kilometers away from the track of Hurricane Dora and she grappled with utility failures and water damage to her oceanfront house brought by the strong Category 2 hurricane. The Contested Relationship Between Experience and PreparednessAfter probing the circumstances of the respondents’ hurricane experience, I examined their reported preparations at the time of the interviews versus reported preparations in prior exposure to hurricanes. The findings supported and challenged the belief that suffering personal loss enhances preparedness across different hazard contexts (e.g., ; ; ). My findings are supportive in the sense that most respondents who experienced no severe damage from past storms have demonstrated stagnation in hurricane preparedness over time. They used to prepare food and/or water and they simply continued to repeat these actions in their current hurricane preparedness. In addition, because the respondents “experienced” the hurricanes a long time ago, the risk became less salient and the effect of experience on preparedness diminished with time (; ; ; ), which perhaps also explains the disconnection between hurricane experience and preparedness. My findings were contradictory in the sense that the three women who were badly affected by past storms displayed no improvements in their hurricane preparedness. For this reason, I describe the relationship between hurricane experience and preparedness that emerged from this study as contested.The puzzling results convey an important message: hurricane preparedness is influenced more by how the respondents interpreted their hurricane experience than by the experience itself. In my sample, many respondents were actually distant from the centers of the storms but claimed hurricane experience. Low levels of physical loss and/or psychological distress have led to a poorer understanding of how strong a hurricane can be and what a good hurricane preparedness plan should entail. These respondents might have erroneously perceived the lack of severe impact as an outcome of personal resilience rather than good luck (e.g., ; ). Accordingly, they are not motivated to undertake additional preparations because they think they have “lived through” a “hurricane.” Reflection of one respondent got straight to the point: “The experience must have to do with a direct hit. You know, people – like in Sandy and Katrina –what they went through, what worked, and what didn’t work, and that sort of thing. But I haven’t had that experience.”For those in the direct paths of Hurricanes Flora, Dora, and Andrew, it would not make sense to directly link intense personal loss from past storms to poor hurricane preparedness. Instead, the state of preparedness is well explained by individual interpretations of the events they experienced. For one woman, the lack of preparations for future hurricanes is related to perceived low self-efficacy: “We can talk about it, but when it really comes to be, I don’t think we’re ready for it. I know when Andrew was coming you could tell that something was gonna happen. You didn’t know how severely it was gonna be, “what should I prepare?” and you really don’t know.” For another, the strong preference of evacuation over sheltering-in-place determined the limited extent of current preparedness. “Be ready to evacuate” is a big lesson she learned from Hurricane Dora: “Well, you have to be able to leave. Don’t stay where the hurricane is likely to hit. You leave.” Finally, the woman who dealt with a friend’s emotional meltdown during Hurricane Flora stressed the importance of peace of mind, an example of mental readiness: “Try not to be afraid. It helps because somebody had to be calm in order for us to get out of the house.” From her perspective, staying calm helped ensure a successful evacuation and their survival. Although the three survivors had very different takeaway messages from their experience, none of them ascribed the damage to the lack or inadequacy of personal preparedness. Discussion and ImplicationsAlthough most self-protective studies involving hurricanes have focused on evacuation (; ), this qualitative study explored the area of preparedness among older residents of Sarasota County in Florida and based the descriptive and analytical interpretations of hurricane preparedness and other closely related topics directly on their narratives. Through semi-structured interviews, the study examined the preparation practices that have been put in place for hurricanes as well as the gaps in current hurricane preparedness among the respondents. It also reported self-identified hurricane readiness and suggested several interpretative frameworks to unpack the meanings of being hurricane-prepared. In addition, it searched for prior exposure to hurricanes to investigate connections (and disconnections) between hurricane experience and preparedness. The following recounts the major findings surrounding these topics. Extent of Hurricane PreparednessThe three types of preparation practices—survival, planning, and structural—are not equally valued. The older respondents overall placed the greatest weight on survival preparedness. Within the survival hurricane preparedness category, most of the respondents kept their efforts at a basic level by only preparing extra water and food, which could apply to any kind of emergency. “Those are everyday preparations not specifically for hurricanes. It is the way I live every day,” as one respondent pointed out. Indeed, hurricane-specific preparedness behavior was not well developed among the respondents. Apart from the typical financial excuse, two alternative barriers have emerged from their narratives: a sense of complacency and knowledge deficit in hurricane preparedness due to an extended period of hurricane inactivity in Sarasota’s recent memory. Level of Hurricane PreparednessMost of the older respondents believed that they were hurricane-prepared despite the limited amount and narrowness of their preparedness practices. This study reported similar findings to some prior work: although Americans were minimally prepared when compared to standard preparedness recommendations, many of them personally felt prepared for hurricanes and wildfires (e.g., ). The discrepancy between actual and perceived hurricane readiness represents various views of “being prepared” among the older respondents. I categorized their interpretations of hurricane readiness into four different cognitive models and teased out several important phenomena. In the first instance, older respondents feel they are ready but the claims are not well supported by what they have practically prepared for hurricanes (i.e., readiness as a feeling). In the second instance, older respondents believe they are ready because they are prepared for whatever comes next in life (i.e., readiness as an attitude towards life). In the third instance, older respondents assert they are ready because they are mentally able to imagine a hurricane situation and line up what would happen with how they would respond (i.e., readiness as a pure mental construct). In the last instance, older respondents consider themselves to be ready since they are well connected to others (i.e., readiness as a state of social embeddedness). The various cognitive routes taken by the respondents will provide new insights and suggest additional pathways to greater preparedness by integrating the psychological and relational components into physical practices. Hurricane Preparedness and Subjective ExperienceThis study showed that like all people, the older respondents tended to count near-misses as part of their hurricane experience. It also affirmed and heightened the complexities surrounding the relationship between hurricane experience and preparedness. Drilling down to the details of the respondent’s hurricane experience, the results showed that the influence of experience on preparedness is confounded by multiple facets of experience (e.g., the recency of the experienced events, the proximity to hazards, and/or the severity of damage in prior exposure). But, for those who were badly affected by strong storms, their preparedness efforts are considerably defined by their subjective interpretations of the experience rather than the actual nature of the experience. Implications for Policy and PracticeExpectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. Apart from a sense of complacency and lack of knowledge, which are perhaps not endemic to older adults, one age-related issue deserves special attention: there are many things that are of potential harm to people when they enter later life and far down the list of concerns is to get killed or injured by a hurricane. As one respondent said, “At my age, you worry about things you can control, not things you can’t.” Another added, “I’m 78, just turned 79...I wanted to get with an undertaker so that when I die, my kids will know who to call. So, I keep putting it [hurricane preparedness] off and, you know, weeks go by, I don’t do anything about it.”A next important step towards effective vulnerability reduction for emergency managers (usually not older adults themselves) is to recognize the financial, cognitive, and affective limitations of older adults and put themselves in a different frame of reference to understand older adults’ choices, values, capacities, and needs in disaster preparedness. It is also imperative to help older adults understand what is going to happen to them personally during hurricanes. Both the availability and content of information regarding hurricane hazards and risk-reduction practices matter. When general education might have low impact, peer education could be an effective approach for enhancing disaster preparedness of older adults through teaching information and sharing behavior among those who are similar in terms of age and life experience (). Another practical and valuable intervention would be building a support network for older adults and disseminating a list of contact information and letting them know who can help with assembling food, water, medications, and other consumables, putting up shutters or boarding up windows, and transferring them to a safe place when their needs arise. Community support can expand personal emergency support networks and improve older adults’ abilities to handle disasters when familial assistance is not readily accessible (). Most importantly, preparedness should be considered in the broader context of multiple risks combing natural hazards and everyday strains by relating vulnerability reduction to larger development planning for older adults in order to improve their general well-being during nondisaster times and to reduce adverse outcomes they may experience during disasters (). Concluding ThoughtsIn conclusion, the study targeted year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida, and utilized semi-structured interviews to explore their extent and level of hurricane preparedness. The results have suggested a suite of possible explanations for the amount of efforts that the respondents spend on hurricane preparedness, a set of personal interpretations of the meanings of being hurricane-prepared, as well as the contested relationship between hurricane experience and preparedness. This study putting a spotlight on hurricane preparedness of older adults adds to the emerging but highly limited body of research and contributes to the literature on hurricane hazards in Sarasota County, Florida (e.g., ; ; ). It also makes methodological contributions to the use of qualitative approaches in the field of natural hazards and vulnerability where quantitative methods are dominant.It is important to emphasize that this study examines a limited number of cases and cannot make immediate generalizations to the entire older populations in other communities. However, the qualitative procedure has enabled me not to resort to the stereotypes associated with this group and to appreciate the diversity and breath embedded within the population. This study is also limited in its focus on hurricane preparedness of older individuals living independently, who are likely to have different personal characteristics and behavioral responses to hurricanes from those in eldercare institutions. Moving forward, to help me further interpret and generalize the qualitative findings of the study, I will develop a survey instrument using the insight from the interviews and deliver the survey to a significantly larger number of older residents in coastal communities at risk from hurricanes.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesIndividual stressors of depressive symptoms in old age are well identified, yet little is known about the neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms. Guided by the ecological extension of the Pearlin’s Stress Process Model, this study explores the rural and urban differences in neighborhood stressors of depressive symptoms among older adults in China.Research Design and MethodsData came from two waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative survey. The study included 6,548 older adults ages 60 and above in 2011, with follow-up in 2013. Predictors (individual and neighborhood characteristics) were drawn from the 2011 baseline, and outcome, depressive symptoms, was extracted from the 2013 wave.ResultsMultilevel modeling results showed that after controlling for depressive symptoms at the baseline, symptoms decreased in neighborhoods where physical environment and social environment were better. Among rural respondents, neighborhood stressors stemmed mainly from the physical environment, whereas among urban residents, the stressors came from the social environment.Discussion and ImplicationsThis study demonstrated and discussed the role that neighborhoods may play in reducing depressive symptoms in later life. Community organizers and policy makers are encouraged to ameliorate community environments to improve mental health among older adults in China. , , , , Depression, one of the most common psychiatric disorders among older populations, causes emotional suffering (; ), reduces quality of life (; ), and increases risk of suicide (). Among other noncommunicable diseases, issues related to depression have only recently been given the attention it deserves in population-based research in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). China is the largest LMIC country in the world. It faces a drastic growth of the aging population and a majority of these older Chinese live in rural areas.In 2013, the number of people 60 and over surpassed 200 million, accounting for 14.8% of the total Chinese population (); another 100 million older adults will be added by the year 2025 (; ). Among older Chinese, an estimated 60% to 80% live in rural areas (; ). The geographic distribution of China’s aging population renders more challenges in that China is not only aging at a rapid rate but that most of the increase is happening in the economically disadvantaged areas ().Studies on depressive symptoms of the Chinese older adults have emerged since the 1980s; however, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among older populations in China was not consistently reported across studies. In general, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults increased over the years. The meta-analysis of studies between 1980s to 1990s found low prevalence of only 3.86% (); whereas, the meta-analysis of studies from 1987 to 2012 reported a pooled prevalence of 23.6% (). The variations may be attributed to the reduced multigenerational household size, the weakened filial culture, the increased awareness of mental illness, and the existence of standardized diagnostic criteria (; ; ). More consistent findings were obtained from recent studies with nationally representative data: one population-based study reported a total prevalence of 39.86% () and another study reported 22.31% for males and 37.60% for females ().It is also noted that depression is much more severe among older adults in rural China. In comparison to the general aging population, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was found approximately 10% higher among rural older Chinese, 37% of whom (40 million) were left behind by the migrating adult generation from rural to urban for employment (). Urbanization and industrialization in China produced millions of low-income, isolated left-behind older adults in rural areas. The city-centric focus of the policies and programs that promote age-friendly communities systematically ignored the challenges and experiences of older adults in rural environments (). As such, millions of older adults in rural areas are overlooked and are likely to be even further marginalized. Conceptual FrameworkGuided by the neighborhood stress process model (), this study explores the neighborhood-level and individual-level antecedents of depressive symptoms for urban and rural Chinese older adults. The neighborhood stress process model is an ecological extension of the Pearlin’s Stress Process Model (PSPM) (). The original PSPM poses the stress process (exposure to stressors, personal coping resources, and mental health outcomes) and argues that stressors influence mental health outcomes directly (sources of stress) and indirectly (mediating resources) (; ).In addition to individual stressors, Aneshensal considers neighborhood-level factors as a social context of the stress process. On the individual-level, the PSPM suggests that disparities in social and economic statuses (SES) shape both the exposure to and consequence of mental health stressors. On the neighborhood-level, neighborhood stressors, such as low neighborhood SES, deterioration of the physical environment, unavailability of health-related care, lack of amenities promoting social and physical activity engagement, are positively related to depression and depressive symptoms (; ). The current study focused on the direct influences of neighborhood stressors on depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults. Due to the lack of measures on indirect stressors in the data set, the authors were not able to more fully test the influence of personal coping resources in the neighborhood stress process model. Depressive Symptoms and Individual-Level StressorsThe risk factors of late-life depression identified in literature are mostly at the individual level. Previous studies show that depressive symptoms in older Chinese are significantly associated with general health during childhood, per capita expenditure, number of chronic health problems (), level of education, gender, and marital status ().Among the individual level stressors, standard of living and health status were identified as key factors associated with depressive symptoms in later life. For example,  found that improved self-perceived income alleviated the depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults.  found that the likelihood of being depressed for older adults with poor economic status was 17.69 times higher than those with good economic status. Health is another important predictor to depression in both Western and Eastern societies. In Europe, levels of health status were negatively associated with depression () and older adults with poor physical health and/or limited physical functioning (e.g., activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living) tended to be more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms (). Similarly, in Taiwan, older adults with greater perceived health stress or with worsened functional conditions were more likely to be depressed (). This finding was also supported in Japan () and China (). Depressive Symptoms and Neighborhood-Level StressorsAs an important indicator of personal well-being, depressive symptoms are often examined with individual-level factors. However, getting older proposes a complicated blending of physiological, behavioral, social, and environmental changes that occur at both the individual level and at a broader level beyond the individual. Taking into consideration, the wider level of environment (e.g., neighborhood) in aging-related research is important in providing a sense of the “big picture” and in describing and explaining the complex blend of the individual and his or her neighborhood (, p.39)A burgeoning body of literature focuses on the effects of both neighborhoods physical and social environments on older individuals’ health and mental health, including depressive symptoms. Neighborhood walkability was found as a significant predictor of depression among older male adults (). Outdoor space in communities influenced individuals’ health behaviors and social participation (; ), which in turn affected individuals’ mental health. Neighborhoods with safety issues and lack of affordable public transportation may limit older adults’ engagement in activities outside of their homes, which could lead to social isolation and mental health issues (; ; ). Social environment factors, including social and health care services, access to sources of social support, opportunities for engagement in social-leisure activities (), and supportiveness of neighborhood environments (), have been associated with better well-being of older adults. The Present StudyIncreasing scholarly interest has led to an emerging body of knowledge about environment and health in later life. However, to date, the majority of knowledge about neighborhood-level determinants of health outcomes in later life among older adults was established through studies conducted in Western or developed countries; these relationships in developing or underdeveloped countries warrant attention, as well.The present study aims to investigate the neighborhood stressors’ influences on depressive symptoms among older Chinese with a focus on rural–urban differences, after accounting for the individual-level stressors. Specifically, the present study poses the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1Individual stressors influence the depressive symptoms in later life. It is expected that (a) lower standard of living and (b) worse health status are associated with more depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults. Hypothesis 2Neighborhood stressors influence depressive symptoms in later life. It is expected that Chinese older adults living in neighborhoods with (a) more physical environment stressors and (b) more social environment stressors have more depressive symptoms. Hypothesis 3The relative importance of physical and social environment stressors in relation to depressive symptoms differs between urban and rural older adults in China. It is expected that social environment stressors have more impact on depressive symptoms among urban Chinese older adults, whereas physical environment stressors have more impact on depressive symptoms among rural Chinese older adults.Using two waves of a nationally representative data in China, this study is one of the first studies that investigates with panel data the effects of neighborhood physical and social environments on depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults. This study extends previous work by (a) including important explanatory variables in both physical and social environments, (b) building a multilevel model of depressive symptoms that takes into account the nesting of older adults within neighborhoods, (c) establishing a longitudinal model with a 2-year time distance for the test of causality, and (d) exploring the differences in neighborhood features and their impacts on depressive symptoms among older adults in rural and urban China. MethodsData and SampleTwo waves (2011 and 2013) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) were used in this study. As modeled after the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, CHARLS collected health and retirement information from a nationally representative sample of Chinese residents ages 45 and older. A team of nearly 500 field interviewers was trained before working in the field to collect the data and the CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing) system was used to perform quality checks during the fieldwork (). In the 2011 baseline, 17,705 individuals from 453 communities were interviewed, among which 15,770 (84.77%) were followed-up in the 2013 wave. Local community officials were interviewed by the field interviewers to respond to the community survey questions. Neighborhood-level data were only available in the baseline.Using the cut-point of 60 years for “older adults” living in LMIC (), we restricted our sample to older adults who were ages 60 and above at the baseline and were interviewed in both waves, resulting in a study sample of 6,548 individuals residing in 447 communities.Among the study sample, at the baseline, 5,047 (77.08%) lived in rural villages, 1,402 (21.41%) lived in urban communities, and 99 (1.51%) lived in combined urban–rural area. The combined urban–rural area was a product of China’s rapid urbanization. These communities were usually located in the outskirts of an urban city and adjacent to rural towns and villages. The interviewees in the combined urban–rural communities were asked questions that were urban community only. For the purpose of making comparisons between the urban and rural communities, this paper included the six combined urban–rural communities to the category of “urban communities.” Therefore, the sample for this study was 5,047 older individuals from 298 rural villages and 1,501 older adults from 149 urban communities.In the present paper, we conceptualized communities in CHARLS as neighborhoods. In CHARLS, communities, as primary sampling units (PSUs), were referred to as administrative villages (cun) in rural areas and neighborhoods (shequ) in urban areas with at least one resident committee (juweihui). As for communities with very large populations (over 2,000 households), a geographic subset of the community was selected as the PSU. In the survey, interviewees were asked, “Is this office a community office or a village office?” The answer “community office” referred to a community in an urban setting; “village committee office” referred to a community in a rural setting; “both village committee office and community office” indicated a community in a combined urban–rural area. As most of the studies defined neighborhoods, the present study used administrative boundaries to characterize neighborhoods (). MeasurementDependent VariableDepressive symptoms in CHARLS were measured by a 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D 10) developed by . The CES-D 10 is a brief screening tool for depressive symptoms with satisfactory psychometric properties and construct validity (; ). Respondents were asked to indicate the frequency, from 1 (rarely or none of the time) to 4 (most or all the time), of mood and behavioral symptoms they have experienced during the previous week. Two positive worded items (happy and hopeful) were reverse-coded. A total possible score ranges from 10 to 40, with a higher CES-D score indicating a higher level of depressive symptoms (Cronbach’s α = 0.79 standardized). Individual-Level StressorsSelf-rated standard of living (SoL) was measured by the respondent’s self reporting on his/her own standard of living. The question was a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (very high). Higher scores indicate better subjective standard of living. Self-rated health was indicated from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Many previous studies have used this item to assess health status and the measure shows good performance and good psychometric properties (; ). Other individual-level variables such as age, gender, educational level, and marital status were controlled for. Neighborhood-Level StressorsThe CHARLS neighborhood survey covered a wide range of topics, including physical infrastructure and public facilities, population and labor, enterprises and wages, health and insurance, neighborhood/village history, and price level to policy parameters. The sources of the information included neighborhood/village officials and interviewer observation.The neighborhood-level characteristics were identified and categorized through the WHO’s Age-friendly communities framework (). With the aim of “optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security” and “enhanc[ing] quality of life as people age,” the WHO’s initiative identified eight domains of a community that must demonstrate age-friendly characteristics: (a) outdoor spaces and buildings, (b) transportation, (c) housing, (d) social participation, (e) respect and social inclusion, (f) civic participation and employment, (g) communication and information, and (h) community support and health services. Similar to many community and neighborhood assessment instruments (), the CHARLS neighborhood survey did not capture all the eight domains. Certain domains were completely missed (e.g., respect and inclusion) and certain domains were heavily weighed over others (e.g., outdoor spaces and buildings) (). Physical Environment StressorsThree aspects of the physical environment were examined: outdoor space and buildings, transportation, and housing. Outdoor space and buildings was measured by the type of roads (1 = paved; 0 = nonpaved), the number of days roads were not passable last year (0–366 days), whether the community has public restrooms (1 = yes), the tidiness of the roads (1 “very poor” to 7 “very good”), and handicapped access to buildings in neighborhood (1 “very poor” to 7 “very good”). Transportation was measured by the number of bus lines accessible in the neighborhood (0–32 lines) and the distance to the most frequently used bus stops (0–100 km). Housing was measured by whether the neighborhood has a sewer system (1 = yes), waste management (1 = yes), and indoor toilets (1 = yes), as well as the number of days with electricity (0–366 days). Social Environment StressorsTwo aspects of social environment were investigated: community support and health services, and neighborhood social economic status (SES). Community support and health services were measured by amenities (e.g., post office, library, police station, bank, theatre, convenience store, farmers’ market, supermarket) in neighborhoods (0–8), outdoor exercise facilities (1 = yes), the number of social organizations (e.g., organization for the elderly adults and handicapped, activity center, and elderly association; ranging from 0 to 3), health centers (1 = yes), and health posts (1 = yes). Neighborhood SES was measured on a 7-point scale, where 1 indicated “poor” and 7 “rich.” AnalysesAn overall univariate analysis and a series of bivariate analyses (t tests and chi-square analyses) were conducted to test differences in individual characteristics and environmental features between rural and urban areas. Further, two-level hierarchical linear regression models (HLM) were performed to correct the cluster effects of the neighborhood on depressive symptoms of older adults (). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for depressive symptoms in this study was 0.09, indicating that a moderate amount of the variability () of depression was accounted for by interneighborhood differences. The use of HLM accounts for the within-neighborhood clustering effects so the estimates are unbiased ().We followed the general approach by  to build the HLM models. First, a null model was fit to determine the extent to which individual’s depressive symptoms were determined by neighborhood-level factors. We found nine percent of variance in depressive symptoms (ICC = 0.09) could be attributed to the neighborhood level. A base model (Model 1) only included individual-level stressors and then subsequent models were built by adding physical environment stressors (Model 2) and social environment stressors (Model 3). To investigate the differences in determinants of depression by region, we present the findings by rural (Model 4a) and urban (Model 4b) samples. To draw a clear time order, we regressed the 2013 outcome (CES-D) on individual- and neighborhood-level stressors in 2011, when the baseline CES-D score was controlled in the models. Maximum likelihood estimation was used for each model to ensure the comparability between different models through fit indices (e.g., Akaike information criterion [AIC] and Bayesian information criterion [BIC]) (). We followed the recommendation by  to use grand mean centering to discern the effects of neighborhood stressors on depressive symptoms while controlling the effects of individual-level factors. The above analyses were also compared to the results if allowing slopes to be random and the results (not shown) suggested that adding random slopes did not improve the model. Therefore, the models presented in this study were random-intercept models to ensure the model parsimony. All the analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). ResultsFindings of Univariate and Bivariate Analyses features descriptive statistics on sample characteristics. The average age of the participants was 68.50 years old, close to half of the participants (49.65%) were women and most were married (77.86%). About one-third of the participants (30.50%) had education of middle school and above. The average self-rated standard of living was 2.47, indicating that on average older Chinese rated their living standard between poor and fair. Older Chinese’s average rating of health status was 2.99, indicating fair. The average CES-D score did not change much: 18.50 at baseline and 18.02 at follow-up. Bivariate results showed that urban respondents were older, with a higher percentage of females, with higher educational levels, higher self-rated standards of living, better self-rated health statuses, and lower CES-D scores in both waves. Table 1.Sample Description at Baseline Wave and Bivariate Analyses Between Rural and Urban Older Residents (Individual Level) Note: CESD = Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; NS = not significant.*p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01; ***p ≤ .001. presents the neighborhood characteristics and the differences of physical and social environments between urban and rural areas. The outdoor spaces and building in the dimension of physical environment showed that around 66% of neighborhoods had paved road, only one-third (36%) had public restrooms, and handicapped access was lower in Chinese neighborhoods. The overall status of housing facilities showed that about one-third of neighborhoods had sewer systems, around half had managed waste systems, and only 40% had indoor toilets. However, the physical environment varied a great deal between rural and urban areas. Compared to rural neighborhoods, those in urban areas had improved outdoor spaces and facilities (e.g., higher coverage of paved roads, more access to public restrooms and handicapped spaces), convenient transportation (e.g., more bus routes and shorter distance between bus stops), and universal housing facilities such as sewer and waste management systems. Stark differences can be found in physical environments between urban and rural neighborhoods.

Table 3.Multilevel Models of the Predictors of Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese Older Adults Note: AIC = Akaike information criterion; BIC = Bayesian information criterion; CESD = Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; SES = social and economic statuses.*p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01; ***p ≤ .001.As for the dimension of social environments, around half of neighborhoods had access to social resources (e.g., neighborhood organization, activity center, or senior association) but only around 10% of neighborhoods had access to health resources. Similarly, social environments also differed significantly between rural and urban areas. Urban neighborhoods, for example, had higher numbers of public amenities and better access to exercise facilities, social resources, and health resources. Further, compared to rural neighborhoods, urban neighborhoods had higher scores in neighborhood SES. These significant differences in physical and social environments between urban and rural areas provide a sound rationale for this study to stratify further the multilevel analyses by rural and urban samples. Findings of Multilevel ModelsMultilevel Models With Entire SampleThe multilevel results with the full sample showed that several individual-level stressors were associated with depressive symptoms (Model 1), including education level (b = −0.78, SE = 0.18), standard of living (b = −0.71, SE = 0.11), and self-rated health (b = −0.75, SE = 0.10; Table 3). Older adults with lower educational levels, lower level of standard of living, and worse self-rated health tended to have more depressive symptoms. Other individual-level characteristics such as age, gender, and marital status were not associated with depressive symptoms.Model 2 added the physical environment stressors and the results showed that several physical environment stressors on the neighborhood-level were associated with older adults’ depressive symptoms. In the domain of outdoor space and buildings, the number of days when roads were not passable (b = 0.003, SE = 0.001) was positively associated with depressive symptoms. In the domain of transportation, the distance to the most frequently used bus stop (b = 0.02, SE = 0.01) was also positively associated with depressive symptoms. In the domain of housing, having a sewer system (b = −0.64, SE = 0.28) and more days with electricity (b = −0.01, SE = 0.004) decreased older adults’ depressive symptom scores.Social environment stressors were added to the final model (Model 3). Results showed that several individual stressors (e.g., education, standard of living, and health) and physical environment stressors (e.g., number of days when roads were not passable, distance to bus stop, and having sewer system) remained significant associations with depressive symptoms. As for the social environment, having outdoor exercise facilities (b = −0.55, SE = 0.27) and having a health center in the community (b = −0.79, SE = 0.31) decreased depressive symptoms among older residents. The model fits (i.e., AIC and BIC) showed that the model was improved incrementally when individual and community stressors were added. Multilevel Models With Rural and Urban SamplesThe study sample was then stratified to explore rural and urban differences. For older adults who lived in rural neighborhoods (Model 4a), individual stressors (e.g., education, standard of living, and self-rated health status) were found significantly associated with depressive symptoms. In the dimension of the physical environment, the number of days when roads were not passable (b = 0.003, SE = 0.001), the distance to bus stops (b = 0.03, SE = 0.01), and having sewer systems (b = −0.76, SE = 0.39) were significant factors associated with depressive symptoms. In the dimension of the social environment, having outdoor exercise facilities (b = −0.93, SE = 0.38) was related to lower depressive symptoms.For older adults living in urban neighborhoods, gender and self-rated health status were associated with depressive symptoms. The neighborhood-level stressors, however, had less influence on older adults’ depressive symptoms. Only one neighborhood-level stressor, having a health center (b = −0.82, SE = 0.36) in the social environment dimension, was related to lower depressive symptoms. No neighborhood-level physical features were associated with depressive symptoms among older urban residents. DiscussionBy using two-waves of panel data and multilevel regression models, this study identified important neighborhood-level stressors that influence depressive symptoms among older Chinese and documented different effects of neighborhood-level factors for rural and urban older adults. Findings of this study supported the hypothesis that standard of living and health status are important individual-level characteristics, the lack of which could contribute to later life depressive symptoms among older Chinese. The findings also supported the hypothesis regarding neighborhood-level stressors. Both physical and social environmental factors, including features in the domains of outdoor space, transportation, housing, and community support and health services, were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among older Chinese. While variables measuring indirect stressors (e.g., coping resources) were not available in the data, the present study was only able to test the effects of direct stressors on depressive symptoms. The findings supported the direct-stressor aspect of the neighborhood stress process model and confirmed the importance of understanding older people’s mental health with the person-in-environment perspective. Specifically, the significant predictors of depressive symptoms on the neighborhood level included the number of days roads were not passable, the distance to bus stop, having sewer system, having outdoor exercise facilities, and having a health center in the neighborhood. The findings were consistent with other studies where neighborhood walkability (), transportation difficulty (), housing condition (), and neighborhood resources availability () were found as significant determinants of mental health among older adults.Older Chinese living in the rural areas experienced greater depressive symptoms than those living in the urban areas and the findings confirmed the hypothesis that physical environment stressors related to depressive symptoms more among rural Chinese older adults, whereas social environment stressors related to depressive symptoms more among urban Chinese older adults. In rural areas, the lagging socioeconomic development was most noticeably embodied in the poor, deficient housing and village infrastructure. The ongoing exposure to these conditions may increase the likelihood of experiencing environmental hazards, daily stress, hardship, and demand (; ), leading to adverse negative emotions such as feeling powerless and hopeless about the future (), and other multiple health consequences (; ). In urban areas, however, physical environment did not appear significant. This may be due to the fact that there was not much variance on the physical environment characteristics, especially basic housing and infrastructure among neighborhoods in urban China. Only one social–environmental characteristic mattered for the urban older adults—having a health center within the neighborhood. This finding is consistent with a study in the metropolitan city of Hong Kong (), where proximity to medical facilities was found as a protective factor against depressive symptoms among older adults.The rural and urban comparative analyses confirmed that communities in urban China were more developed, better managed, and better infrastructured than villages in rural China. The stark gap in basic housing conditions, outdoor space, transportation, and social/health services between rural and urban communities is concerning for millions of older adults aging in rural China. Policy makers are urged to develop programs and provide services that emphasize improving neighborhoods’ physical environment for rural older Chinese. For example, government should increase budget and allocate more financial resources to improve the environment of the villages, with a current focus on the basic living conditions (e.g., sewer system) and neighborhood infrastructure (e.g., road condition, public transportation). Given the higher levels of depressive symptoms in rural areas, developing support programs to reach lonely or isolated older adults as well as community-based social services at convenient venues is essential. For older adults in urban neighborhoods, among a variety of neighborhood amenities and services, only proximity to health center influenced depressive symptoms. Health centers within walking distance in the neighborhood help alleviate the stress associated with physical illnesses in case of emergency. This finding suggested that efforts be made to reduce the barriers in accessibility to health care and medical facilities for older urban residents. In addition, a need in the professional workforce for an aging society surfaced, suggesting that China prepare professional clinicians, health care providers, and gerontological social workers to provide quality services to older adults.Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the neighborhoods of older adults’ residences in the second wave were not updated because of the unavailability of the neighborhood-level data in that wave, preventing the control of the effect of changes in neighborhoods in the analyses. A relocation measure, however, was identified in the second wave of CHARLS, showing that 9.8% of the study sample relocated between two waves. However, little could be determined about the relocation dynamics (e.g., rural-to-urban or urban-to-rural migration). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were consistent with and without relocated samples. Second, the current study categorized the respondents and neighborhoods into rural and urban without taking into consideration the regional variation in socioeconomic development. The large economic inequality was found attributable not only to the rural–urban divide, but also the regional/provincial variation (). Third, the measures of the neighborhood-level characteristics may not have fully captured the environmental stressors or supportiveness. The current measures did not assess the quality, affordability, accessibility, or utilization of neighborhood resources. For instance, the survey measured whether or not the neighborhood had a health center but did not capture the services available there. Furthermore, questions about neighborhoods were asked to and answered by the local village or neighborhood workers. The data would be more accurate and valid if older residents themselves were asked to respond to the questions. Lastly, the extend of the data collection and the number of people involved across a wide geographical area could threaten the inter-rater reliability. Although data collection quality was closely monitored, the information about the inter-rater reliability was not available.The present study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the disparities among older adults in urban and rural China. Depression levels and environmental characteristics vary significantly, with rural older adults being in disadvantaged situations. Further, this study documents the negative effects of neighborhood conditions on the mental health of older adults, especially in rural areas. Findings should be used to advocate for increased infrastructure development as well as social and health care programming in rural areas. AcknowledgmentsY. Wang, Y-C. Chen, H-W. Shen, and N.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to examine the factors contributing to the social isolation of older residents of a high-crime neighborhood through the in-depth examination of their lived experiences. A deeper understanding of factors contributing to social isolation can allow policymakers and health care providers to create policies and programs to alleviate the social isolation of these vulnerable and understudied individuals.Research Design and MethodsParticipants were recruited through the support of the Housing Authority and Police and Fire Departments of Richmond, California, a town with a high-crime rate. Fifty-nine ethnographic interviews were conducted with 20 individuals of 58–95 years of age. Transcripts and fieldnotes were analyzed with a focus on the specific factors contributing the social isolation of participants.ResultsAn overarching theme of tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation and desire for social integration emerged from qualitative content analysis. A tension emerged between a longing to participate in society and the immersion in a reality so dense with obstacles that made participation in society difficult to attain. Four specific themes also emerged. Three themes demonstrated underlying factors of social isolation stemming from the personal sphere and the physical and social environment. The fourth theme illustrated participants’ desire for social integration.Discussion and ImplicationsFindings demonstrate the salience of interventions and programs to make neighborhoods safe and accessible to older residents. Findings also suggest a need to reframe the conceptual framework for social isolation to better measure and alleviate this public health problem. , , , , , , , , Social isolation is a public health problem whose damages have been compared in scale with cigarette smoking (). Although a universal definition is missing, social isolation is usually defined as the objective paucity of meaningful social contact measured in terms of network size and community involvement (; ; ). Older adults are especially prone to experience social isolation. Their social ties may decrease with the passing of years due to retirement, death or institutionalization of friends and relatives, likelihood of living alone, and an increasing geographical mobility of their social network (). Isolated older adults are at high risk for poor health outcomes (; ), especially those with diabetes (), cancer (), and coronary-heart disease ().Despite evidence deriving mostly from quantitative studies, little is known about the lived experience of socially isolated older adults, particularly those who face additional stressors such as living in neighborhoods with high crime. This is a concerning gap in knowledge because it is well known that older residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods die earlier and are not as healthy as older residents of affluent neighborhoods (; ). Older adults are particularly affected by the character of their neighborhood because they are likely to be less mobile and have smaller social networks than younger generations (). Socially isolated older adults are also likely to fear surrounding crime (), which further exacerbates their isolation.The few qualitative studies on socially isolated older residents of high-crime neighborhoods raised awareness about their dire living conditions (; ).  examinations of the factors of social isolation in these individuals mostly relied on the examination of their belongings after deaths resulting from natural disasters; his study was titled “social autopsy” for this reason.  examined the social networks of older residents residing in Single Occupancy Rooms (SROs). These studies laid a foundation for inquiry in this area. But limitations from these studies also suggest that additional studies are needed to extend the understanding for social isolation beyond the very specific contexts of postdisaster settings or SROs. More depth is also needed from protracted observations with subjects in their environment over time.A deeper understanding of the lived experience of socially isolated older residents of high-crime neighborhoods is important for several reasons. First, through this understanding, we can gain critical information on factors that foster isolation. Understanding the lived experience of these individuals also refine the framework of reference for scholars of social isolation. This information matters because some scholars have examined social isolation and loneliness as interchangeable concepts when in fact there are differences and overlaps in these terms (). Whereas social isolation has been defined as an objective paucity of meaningful relationships, loneliness has a more subjective connotation. Specifically, loneliness can be explained as the “discrepancy between one’s desired relationship and one’s actual relationship” (, p. 1079). As a result, a sense of “perceived” and therefore subjective isolation is treated as a component of loneliness. Second, understanding the lived experience of socially isolated older residents of high-crime neighborhoods can refine measures of social isolation. As a result of an emphasis on individual traits, measures have focused on personal and unidimensional factors contributing to isolation, including perceived lack of companionship (), size of discussion networks (), number of persons in the household, contact with friends and relatives, or religious attendance (). Considering that researchers have grappled for decades with multiple definitions and measures of social isolation, a public health problem that lacks agreed-upon standards and well-validated measures (; ), it is particularly important to understand the lived experience of socially isolated people.In an attempt to address the three reasons mentioned earlier, we designed a qualitative study to better understand the lived experience of socially isolated older residents of high-crime neighborhoods in order to identify factors that contributed to their isolation. This aim was addressed through qualitative research methods. This choice was driven by the experiential nature of the information we wished to collect () and by the exploratory character of this research. In this exploratory study, a source of theoretical inspiration was  call to identify the influence of political, economic, and social dynamics in the words, assumptions, and behaviors of our study participants. Under the paradigm that the personal is political and the political is personal, Mills invites social scientists to uncover and describe the influence of larger dynamics in subjective experiences.To identify factors that contributed to isolation, we had to overcome the major limitations of previous, foundational studies on this topic, which were limited by sample and short-term study period. To study a more diverse group of community-dwelling older adults, we focused on older residents of Richmond, CA, a low-income and racially/ethnically diverse community of 100,000 inhabitants. Richmond is a high-crime community with one of the highest homicide rates among similar-sized communities in the United States, with, for example, 26 murders in 2015 (). To extend the depth of our findings, we followed participants longitudinally and conducted multiple interviews in their homes. Finally, to identify participants who are “off the grid,” we partnered with emergency services (Fire and Police Departments) to recruit participants who were housed within the community but would otherwise be “invisible” because they did not utilize senior centers or other community resources. Collectively, these innovative elements of our approach enabled us to study social isolation in new ways that will expand our collective understanding of key factors in social isolation, refine its theoretical framework, and lead to improved measures to develop better interventions. Design and MethodsStudy Design, Participants, and SettingThis analysis used participant observation and in-depth ethnographic interviews conducted between February 2014 and October 2015 with 20 older residents of Richmond, California, met 59 times overall. The average age of participants was 72 (standard deviation 12, range 58–95). To account for the early mortality of African American men (), we enrolled adults aged 55 and over. The sample comprised 50% women. The majority (60%) of informants were African Americans, followed by 30% Non-Latino White, and 20% Latinos. Participants were recruited through Richmond Police and Fire Departments and Housing Authority. With regard to recruitment, a Captain of the Police Department wrote letters to 66 residents with cases of elder abuse reported between January 2013 and May 2015 and invited them to join the study. His rationale was that victims of elder abuse are likely to have limited meaningful social ties. Three of them joined the study. Crews of the Fire Department gave handouts about the study to rescued older adults, one of whom joined the study. The remainder of the participants joined the study after the first author participated in cockroach inspections with an officer of the Housing Authority, and handed fliers about the study. At the end of the data collection (December 2015), preliminary findings were discussed in a focus group with eight officers from Police and Fire Departments, Housing Authority, and agencies providing legal and health services. Data CollectionTo obtain in-depth information, data were collected through ethnographic interviews and participant observation, as well as the focus group. Ethnographic interviews provide a process that tailors questions in a fluid manner to respondents’ trains of thought (). Most interviews occurred in the morning, when crimes rates are lower. Participant observation is defined as “the observation carried out when the researcher is playing an established participant role in the scene studied” (, p. 4). In this project, participant observation included taking walks, eating together, watching TV, and going on errands. Ethnographic interviews and participant observation were used to investigate how older adults described their lived experience in their homes and in their neighborhoods. Interviews were also used to elicit participants’ perspective on isolation. We also wanted to understand the relationship of participants to their support networks: therefore, we explored which support networks they relied upon, and how these networks linked to needed or preferred services. Interviews lasted approximately 1.5 hr and were conducted in English (two in Spanish with an interpreter). We met with each participant at least twice and several times with some participants who provided particularly rich information. Fieldnotes were captured in an audio-recorder at the end of each encounter. Fieldnotes contained a description of each participant (clothes, demeanor, appearance), their surroundings (temperature, noise, odors), and investigators’ reactions to each encounter (unease, biases, confusion, surprises). To test their understanding, investigators often shared with participants what they genuinely thought was going on. A professional transcriptionist transcribed recordings of interviews, fieldnotes, and focus group. Transcripts were then imported in Atlas.ti. This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California–San Francisco. All the names are pseudonyms and potentially identifying features of participants were omitted or slightly changed. Data AnalysisQualitative content analysis () of transcripts of interviews, fieldnotes, and focus group was initially used to identify factors that contributed to the isolation of study participants. This method of analysis of qualitative, narrative, and ethnographic data focuses on the information coming from the data without the use or creation of a priori theoretical constructs (). In the first stage, transcripts of interviews and fieldnotes were analyzed line by line by two authors to identify specific factors that contributed to isolation and how isolation was defined by participants. A code was created every time a particular factor was identified. For example, the code “surrounding crime” was created every time local crime made participants wary to entertain social relations of any kind, as in the participant’s quote: “People come to visit and they steal everything you’ve got” and in the fieldnote quote about another participant: “Now, she has people around but they are kind of sketchy or they are dirty. She said, ‘They are dirty. They tell lies’.” Similarly, the code “body” was created every time participants mentioned that anything in their body refrained from engaging in social relations as in participant’s quote “Look at me and the situation I’m in: Eight per cent bedridden all the time, and stuck.” During this stage, we also noted that participants often mentioned their longing to engage in social relations. For example, the bedridden participant also shared her desire to understand how to join a local program and stop wearing “gowns.” She noted, “So I want to go to the day care place and show my outfits off.” Quotes like this one were coded as “longing for social integration.” E Portacolone coded a subset of transcripts, created the codebook with the description and example of each code, and wrote memos to reflect on the data. Another researcher (J Yeh) coded the rest of the transcripts with frequent iterative discussion with E Portacolone to make sure that both researchers’ criteria agreed (). As the coding progressed, E Portacolone discovered themes through the process of connecting codes and writing memos (). In this stage, we noted that the source of the recruitment of participants did not have an obvious effect on the themes that emerged. Thematic saturation was found with regard to four themes. Saturation is found when no new types of information or themes are added as new informants come to be interviewed. One theme was “longing for social integration.” This theme was unexpected and originated from the inductive analysis of the data. The other three themes generated from the original aim of the research, which was to understand which broad categories of factors contributed to the isolation of participants. These themes were social isolation stemming from (a) the personal sphere (which included quotes coded as “body”), (b) the social environment (which included quotes coded as “surrounding crime”), and (c) the physical environment (which included quotes coded as “surrounding unclean”). Finally, after a review of themes and codes, R Greysen identified the “tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation, and the desire for social-integration” as the overarching theme that well captured the overall findings of this investigation. ResultsFrom the qualitative content analysis, a recurrent and unifying theme emerged: The “tension between personal and structural factors of social isolation, and the desire for social integration.” Within this overarching theme, four specific themes emerged. Three themes described specific factors that facilitated the isolation of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods. The fourth theme described study participants’ desire for social integration. Overarching Theme: Tension Between Personal and Structural Factors of Social Isolation, and the Desire for Social IntegrationA tension emerged between participants’ longing to participate in society and their immersion in a reality so dense with obstacles that made this participation difficult to attain. The social isolation of study participants manifested in different ways. In most participants, social isolation was generated by personal factors. Chronic health conditions, disabilities, and poverty limited their meaningful interactions. A nuanced analysis of the data also identified specific factors from the social and physical environment (second and third themes) that contributed to a “structural” isolation of participants. As their narratives elucidate, structural factors contributing to isolation were often beyond their control. Despite living in difficult settings, participants longed to be integrated, which is the fourth unexpected theme. This theme was unexpected because the literature on social isolation rarely mentions this longing. The contrast between the isolation of participants and their longing for social integration made tangible the tension between factors of social isolation and desire for social integration.The description and narratives of the overarching theme and associated themes deeply resonated with the officers of local agencies of the focus group. As soon as the presentation of the findings ended, the officer of the Housing Authority said, “So many of these stories I hear every day…They are people that really need support, physical and also emotional support and the system failed them. From their own relatives, to the government, and the system.” After being silent for a long time, a senior officer stated, “I am listening to these stories and they just repeat themselves over and over again and it is very widespread. It is all over the city….It is a problem. It is an epidemic. I really feel needs to be exposed.” As he alluded, and other officers confirmed, the narratives of participants were not exceptional. Instead, they evoked the trajectories of many older residents of areas with a high prevalence of substance abuse, poverty, unemployment, and widespread crime. Social Isolation Stemming From the Personal SphereSpecific personal attributes of study participants fostered their limited meaningful social ties. These included (a) chronic health conditions; (b) limited social ties; and (c) poverty. First, chronic health issues often constrained the older adults’ mobility, as well as stamina. Take Mr. John Hershon, 58, a former mechanic who, despite his rather young age, spent most of his time in his bedroom watching documentaries by himself. His lack of stamina was one of the reasons for this lifestyle. He explains, “I have like—not a heart problem but congestive heart failure. But I’ve been suffering from that for, shit, almost 30, 40 years.” Chronic health issues can be exacerbated by substance addiction. For example Ms. Anne Bless, 64, a woman with a raspy voice and unable to walk, noted, “My health is failing some.” Despite her ability to stop her heroin addiction and take methadone weekly, she is an alcoholic. She usually sits in the dark either on a wheelchair or in a single bed in an apartment oversaturated by cigarette smoke, with only a feeble light, coming from a television screen. A large bottle of vodka and some cigarettes rested next to her. Her chin tends to lie over her chest, and because she becomes tired quickly, conversations with her have been short.Second, as studies on isolation have amply shown, the death, lack of mobility, or geographical distance of meaningful social ties is yet another factor that fosters the isolation of older adults. Mr. Cameron Jones, 58, for example, said, “My friends have either moved away or passed away or they have their own life. They are older like me, they don’t get out much.” This statement is representative of other study participants who lost touch with spouses, siblings, or close friends. Finally, poverty constrained the actions of most participants. For example, Mr. Hershon, the documentaries enthusiast, could not afford taking someone on a date or fixing his car to go fishing. “I’m broke,” he repeated. Social Isolation Stemming From the Social EnvironmentThree factors of the social environment contributed to the social isolation of study participants: (a) immersion of participants in an environment dense with crime; (b) weak norms of reciprocity; and (c) toxic relations. First, the embeddedness of study participants in an environment where family members, neighbors, and acquaintances who were involved in criminal activities or suffered from substance abuse or mental illnesses, hampered the creation, and maintenance of meaningful social ties. As a result, participants often mentioned having “associates” rather than friends. Moreover, because of their disabilities in buildings with one unarmed guard and easy access to prostitutes, homeless, and drug dealers, study participants often feared stepping outside their apartment or using elevators. For example, Mr. Jones remained in his apartment watching movies because his slow gait made him an easy target for robberies. He explained:I don’t like going outside. You can’t visit your neighbors; nobody wants you to come in their house. Only the criminals…People robbed me up about three times up here. People come to visit and they steal everything you’ve got.Ms. Anne Jude, 60, a woman with a long list of chronic illnesses, echoed Mr. Jones, saying, “Everybody stick to themselves,” a recurrent expression among participants. Before her sister moved in with her, Ms. June always kept a can of pepper spray in her bra. As she explains, “There really is no protection…And you know inside the elevators or inside the stairwells is where you get attacked.” Mr. Ray Clay, 79, an affable man, stuck to himself in his apartment because he felt unsafe to walk outside. He said, “Lots of noisy people. Just standing outside here. It’s not safe. Drinking. Not safe…I mean, it’s too many motherf----s, too many son of a b----s, too many pistol whippings.” During a cockroach inspection, the lead author observed an older man who lived literally barricaded in his apartment. Certain days are particularly heated as Mr. John West, 67, explained, “during the first of the month you would have a lot of disturbance when people get their checks, then they start getting drunk and people can buy drugs and things of that nature. So you have a lot of activity in the area.” Drug trafficking in this neighborhood was so common that an old man approached three authors of this study to solicit for drugs while they were inside a car parked near a recruitment site.Second, weak norms of reciprocity were a feature of this harsh social environment and contributed to the paucity of social relations of many study participants. These weak norms of reciprocity may derive from the immersion of older adults and their acquaintances in the same difficult environment. This phenomenon is tangible for example in the case of Ms. Virginia Waters, 87, a sociable widow and former administrative assistant who recently, soon after the death of two family members, became wheelchair bound. Despite these accidents, Ms. Waters explained that her friends—“Well, I call them friends”—often deserted her because of her recent disability. She recalled a “friend” saying: “You are still in a wheelchair. I can’t take that wheelchair with us. I can’t lift it out of the car. It’s heavy.” As a result, after becoming wheelchair bound, her weekend outings with them stopped.Ms. Waters’ narrative also illustrates how the social environment contributes to the isolation of older residents of neighborhoods in disrepair. As a result of the lack of affordable and high-quality services (discussed in the next section), older residents often have to rely on an underground economy of informal caregivers that is often too expensive. For instance, Ms. Waters started skipping her Sunday Mass because of the costs to get there on a wheelchair. She explained,It’s usually two people that come. I pay the woman $20, the man $20. So I’m out $40 there to take me to church and bring me back. And then I put it often in church. So I just have to put $50—I put $10 in church—just about $50 just to go to church.The members of the focus group confirmed this trend. An officer commented: “I think it’s ridiculous that they need to pay $20 to get a ride to go to church. And that’s how they get taken advantage of. It’s like vultures, these caretakers, they become vultures.” As a part of this economy, some study participants had homeless people running errands and cleaning their home in exchange for a place to sleep. Homeless people, however, ate their food and sometimes robbed them. These complex exchanges made it difficult at times to understand dynamics during fieldwork. For instance a participant was concerned that a homeless man was taking advantage of his former wife, whereas the woman complained about the ex-husband: “I should get a restraining order.” She added, “I feel trapped.”On a related note, a third factor that often contributed to the social isolation of participants was toxic ties. The toxicity of these relationships mostly derived from the immersion of participants in an environment saturated with crime, prostitution, poverty, drug addiction, and violence. An example of these toxic ties comes from Ms. Thelma Jagg, 67, a woman with depression, who became distressed after she cleaned the house of a granddaughter who had been brutally abused by her husband. Ms. Jagg cleaned the house with a daughter who hit her, (“she jumps at me”), a fact that Ms. Jagg reported to the authorities. She also cleaned the house with her 2-year-old great grandson, who was being raised by her because the mother of the toddler, described as “a hooker,” was unable to do so. Caring for the toddler was so exhausting to Ms. Jagg that she often snapped at him. She said that she planned to take him to a foster home. Social Isolation Stemming From the Physical EnvironmentParticipants were often isolated because the physical environment surrounding them did not support social interactions. This included (a) the physical decay of building and streets in their neighborhood, including a lack of safe and accessible benches and community rooms and (b) the paucity of health care and social services available. First, the aging and disrepaired built environment contributed to the social isolation of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods. Participants avoided elevators and stairways not only for fear of being “attacked” but also because they were sometimes used as toilets. During fieldwork, we noted piles of garbage near entrance doors, cracks in the pavement, and a hole next to the sidewalk created by the surface of a manhole half sunk in the pavement (). Furthermore, in between houses empty lots invaded by weeds were often used as dumpsters for sofas, mattresses, rugs, and garbage (). Figure 1.Hole next to the sidewalk.Figure 1.Hole next to the sidewalk. Figure 2.Empty lots.Figure 2.Empty lots.Another condition that deterred one participant from walking to the only senior center located downtown was the state of the sidewalks. In his words, “The street is uneven, it’s cracked, it’s broken. It’s sticking up.” During fieldwork, most pungent smells included disinfectant in the elevators and hallways, cigarette smoke, and whiffs of garbage. Ms. Jodi Green, 71, explained that lingering smell came from the massive open-air dumpster: “The bin is never washed. The same way they take it out is the same way they bring it back.” She reported this concern to the local department of public health without success. She adds, “When it’s hot you’ve got the gnats coming in, you’ve got the flies swarming around your door. You can keep everything clean, but what’s the good of keeping your side clean when all of the filth is right there?” Unpleasant surroundings sometimes deterred acquaintances from visiting older tenants. In addition, some tenants were embarrassed to show the deterioration of their surroundings to visitors.Residence in developments notorious for its infestation of rats, bedbugs, and mold contributes to the social isolation of participants. For example, during a long hospitalization, Mr. Jones discovered that he was placed on isolation because of a fungus inside his nose, a fungus that he said was infested with mold. Mr. Jones also mentioned the limited choices stemming from his residence in a stigmatized building when he said: “Nobody that takes Section Eight [subsidized housing] will rent to people here because they hear there’s bedbugs and stuff in this building and they don’t want you to bring that in their building.”Yet another factor that contributed to the social isolation of study participants was the paucity of places where they could congregate. Community rooms of buildings for seniors were often locked. As a participant noted, “I don’t know why they’ve got a community room if you’re not allowed to use it. That one I haven’t figured out.” The same participant explained that the administrator of the building forbade an older tenant to play music in a weekly “breakfast club” held in an alley. In his words, “We really enjoyed the breakfast club. Would find out about each other…And we talked about having a birthday party.” Once the administrator also forbade the use of the alley, the club disbanded.Second, a critical factor stemming from the physical environment that contributed to the social isolation of participants was the paucity of good-quality health care and social services available. One reason for this paucity was that formal care providers and volunteers avoided visiting seniors tenants of high-crime neighborhoods, as a manager of a safety-net provider explained in the focus group. A seasoned social worker described the area as “a desert of resources” and said that she was too afraid to serve clients in some neighborhoods. Another reason was the uneven allocation of resources for older residents in the County. For example older residents of Richmond could use only a portion of public services available in Walnut Creek, an affluent and smaller town nearby. A result of this dearth of services was the poor quality of home care aides. For example, during 6 months of visits to Ms. Mary Davis, 95, a wheelchair-bound woman whose only daughter lived away and was drug addicted, the lead author observed a succession of four home care aides. The first filled the sink, stove, and microwave with encrusted pans, and frequently left the job to linger outside a liquor store. The second lasted 1 month. Before disappearing, the third cut Ms. Davis’ phone line and explained that Ms. Davis had been suddenly taken away by her family, which was not true. (Finally, 2 months later, the last aide, who was reliable saw Ms. Davis die.)Yet another manifestation of inappropriate services was the inability of providers to understand the specific needs of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods. For example, Mr. Jones, the man afraid of walking outside because of his slow gait, said on multiple occasions that a motorized wheelchair would make a big difference to him:If I had a motorized scooter I could get on public transportation, I could go to the movies, I can go out and have a nice dinner, I can go to the Marina and fish…I don’t have to be a sitting duck.Despite his insistence, his physician opposed the idea because she wanted him to use his legs. Mr. Jones respected her recommendations and did his best to follow a diet rich in fresh vegetables, even though they were almost too expensive for him. A Desire to be Socially IntegratedA common thread among participants was a strong desire to be socially integrated. “I don’t want to be a sitting duck,” as Mr. Jones said from his couch, while he listed all the activities he longs to partake. Like him, participants longed for company and to go on outings to dine, fish, watch sports, pray, and date. Participants often mentioned their desire to interact more often with others. A compelling representation of this longing comes from the narrative of a gregarious participant. “I’d like to go out all the time, but it is not safe,” he said. Too afraid to step out of his apartment, sometimes he stations himself near the door of his apartment, with a bag of candies in his hand, waiting for the sound of footsteps. “Sometimes I stand here maybe 10 or 15 minutes and nobody comes and I put it back and close the door.” Once somebody comes by, he offers candies and invites the person to play a game with him. His efforts had limited success. He added, “No one, except one man, he comes to play. I’ve been here four years. And only one.” The participant felt safe inviting passerby in because he interacted with them on a one-to-one basis, and he felt reassured by knowing a martial move.Participants often compared a past, where they were engaged in society, to a present limited of meaningful personal interactions. “I am not used to this life,” said Ms. Davies, the same woman who had four home care aides in the last 6 months of her life. Despite her warmth and grace, her social relations were scarce and mostly toxic. Confined to a wheelchair, she spent most of her time in her small kitchen, a tiny room kept warm by the flames of the kitchen burners. She longed having someone to talk to. During one of the visits of the lead author, as Ms. Davies locked eyes with her, she said, “See, I have got company [chuckles]. And I appreciate it very much.” DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the lived experience of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods to identify factors that contributed to their social isolation. These findings suggest that social isolation can manifest as a structural phenomenon rooted in the physical and social environment. A tension emerged between longing to participate in society and an immersion in harsh and underserved surroundings. This finding challenges the assumption about the isolated older adult as someone who is “enjoying more solitude,” is a “loner” (, p. 43), or has poor social skills. In this study, older adults with scarce meaningful social ties desired more social integration. With varying degrees, they longed for good company, outings, and intimacy. This longing to participate in society reflects some feeling of loneliness among participants and points to the overlap between a subjective feeling of loneliness and the objective paucity of meaningful social relationships. This study also hints to the consequences of social isolation in the wellbeing of study participants. Participants with chronic health conditions often were sedentary because they were afraid of walking outside and lacked resources to know about, let alone afford, healthier lifestyles.One strength of this study is its analysis of the multiple factors that contribute to the isolation of older adults. Whereas most literature concentrated on the factors related to the personal environment (; ), this study contributes to the literature on social isolation by shifting the attention toward structural factors that exacerbate the isolation faced by older adults. Previous studies provided evidence of the harsh conditions of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods, including weak norms of reciprocity (), deteriorated neighborhoods, surrounding crime, and limited services (; ). They did not, however, examine the specific role of these factors in contributing to social isolation. The only study that performed the analysis mostly drew evidence from the belongings of deceased persons (). For its emphasis toward the role of the environment, this work underlines the importance of spatial analyses in aging studies () and therefore contributes to geographical gerontology, defined as “the study of geographical dimension of aging” (, p. 440), as well as to environmental gerontology, that is, the study of relations between older adults and their surroundings (). Specifically, our findings confirm the conceptual framework of , which suggests an association between poor health and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood. Findings also are consistent with the conceptual framework of , which underscored the role of the neighborhood environment with the accumulation of biological risks and related health disparities.With regard to the method employed, this study illustrates the importance of spending time to recruit persons who may be harder to reach using traditional recruitment settings common in gerontological research, such as community rooms or adult day health centers. To delve into the challenges of aging in place, investigators should devise creative strategies to recruit isolated older adults. A related future direction for research is that epidemiologists should estimate the number and characteristics of older residents of high-crime neighborhoods in urban areas so that we better comprehend the size of this vulnerable population. This is important because data on their prevalence are not easily available and because the majority of older adults (58%) resides in urban areas worldwide (), and therefore, they may be likely to reside in high-crime neighborhoods, especially immigrants and those with low socioeconomic status ().Our findings contribute to the literature on social isolation in fours ways. First, they suggest that the exploration of the lived experience of isolated individuals is an opportunity to improve measures of social isolation. To do so, researchers should spend time with individuals with a paucity of meaningful social ties to understand the reasons behind this paucity and then to examine if existing measures of social isolation captured the reasons observed in the field, a practice often used to refine quantitative measures (). Second, findings suggest the importance of including features of the social and physical environment in measures of social isolation. These features include the presence of crime, condition of sidewalks, ease of walking outside, presence of services nearby, and perception of the neighborhood. Third, considering that the traditional definition of social isolation indicates a paucity of meaningful social relations, this study provides the framework for a more accurate definition of these meaningful relationships. We provided evidence that socially isolated persons might entertain social relations that are toxic and therefore not meaningful in the positive connotation of the word. Yet these toxic relations might have meaning. It is therefore critical to emphasize that persons who are socially isolated have a paucity of “nontoxic” meaningful relations. Accordingly, findings suggest that measures of social isolation should assess whether the relations with member of one’s network are toxic. Last, findings demonstrate the need to distinguish between social isolation stemming solely from personal factors and a social isolation imposed by the environment and therefore structural. For example, whereas people who avoid interactions with family members, friends, or neighbors are socially isolated by choice, people who want such interactions but miss them because they are afraid to get out are structurally socially isolated. This distinction would explain why the researchers of a qualitative study of Canadian elders found that a considerable portion of participants ascribed their isolation to their enjoyment of solitude (). We speculate that these elders did not face structural barriers to their integration, as our participants did. The social isolation of these elders, defined as “loners,” was mostly subjective because it was derived from their own preference; it was not imposed by the environment. Even though “structural” and “personal” social isolations have fluid and overlapping boundaries, this novel distinction is critical when designing specific interventions.A policy implication is that social policies and programs should consider interventions to make the community safe because residents of safe environments are less likely to be isolated (). Interventions might include improved sidewalks, more lightning, renovation of dilapidated buildings, presence of reliable and trustworthy security officers, home care aides, social workers, as well as of high-quality and affordable transportation services. A related policy implication is that specific resources should be allocated to support older residents of high-crime neighborhoods to interact with health care providers attuned to their priorities, as well as to access safe places, such as churches, beauty parlors, or other communal areas. Based on our findings, to identify and support vulnerable older adults in areas with high crime, we recommend the creation of partnerships between agencies serving the elder adults and the Police and Fire Departments. Finally, another implication of the findings is that older adults should not be pointed as responsible for their social isolation. Instead, greater attention needs to be devoted to identify and alleviate the external mechanisms contributing to their isolation. LimitationsThis study has three main limitations. First, the small size of the sample limits the generalizability of the findings and the observation of differences between ethnic/racial groups. Second, the limited geographical scope comprised a specific locale culturally. Third, with regard to data analysis, the interrater reliability for the two coders was not calculated. ConclusionAs  “social autopsy” suggested through the examination of belongings of deceased informants, and this study confirmed with the observation of alive informants, older community-dwelling residents of high-crime neighborhoods are particularly at risk for social isolation. This is a concerning public health issue because an increasing number of people make it to old age and because most urban areas worldwide have high-crime neighborhoods. Furthermore, health disparities are often rooted in differences in social and physical environments (). We therefore look forward to future examinations and interventions on the structural determinants of social isolation in older adults.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesEmerging research regarding aging in neighborhoods emphasizes the importance of this context for well-being; however, in-depth information about the nature of person–place relationships is lacking. The interwoven and complex nature of person and place points to methods that can examine these relationships in situ and explore meanings attached to places. Participatory geospatial methods can capture situated details about place that are not verbalized during interviews or otherwise discerned, and qualitative methods can explore interpretations, both helping to generate deep understandings of the relationships between person and place. This article describes a combined qualitative-geospatial approach for studying of older adults in neighborhoods and investigates the qualitative-geospatial approach developed, including its utility and feasibility in exploring person–place transactions in neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsWe developed and implemented a qualitative-geospatial approach to explore how neighborhood and person transact to shape sense of social connectedness in older adults. Methods included narrative interviews, go-along interviews, and global positioning system tracking with activity/travel diary completion followed by map-based interviews. We used a variety of data analysis methods with attention to fully utilizing diverse forms of data and integrating data during analysis. We reflected on and examined the utility and feasibility of the approach through a variety of methods.ResultsFindings indicate the unique understandings that each method contributes, the strengths of the overall approach, and the feasibility of implementing the approach. Discussion and ImplicationsThe developed approach has strong potential to generate knowledge about person–place transactions that can inform practice, planning, policy, and research to promote older adults’ well-being. , , , Emerging research regarding aging in context reveals much about how neighborhoods relate to aging adults’ health, participation, and inclusion. Quantitative studies have identified neighborhood characteristics that relate to well-being and inclusion and qualitative studies have explored phenomena such as exclusion in neighborhoods (e.g. ). More in-depth and nuanced information about the nature of these person–place relationships is needed to support aging in neighborhoods, creating the challenge of developing innovative research approaches that can generate such information. As such, this article describes an approach that draws on qualitative and geospatial methods aimed at understanding transactions between older adults and their neighborhoods, illustrating its development and reflecting on its potential.It is increasingly recognized that place is not a static entity, and that person–place relationships are dynamic, complex, and imbued with meaning. For example, building from the Ecological Theory of Aging () which began to consider the dynamic interactions between individuals and the environment;  emphasized belonging, identity, and place attachment within the person–place relationship. Transactional perspectives also shift away from a conceptualization of place as a container for human activity toward understanding place and person as mutually shaping and inseparable from one another (; ; ). Thus, neighborhoods are dynamic places imbued with meaning as well as spaces composed of physical and social elements that influence individuals and are shaped through interactions. Given that any one research method brings to light particular aspects of a phenomenon while leaving other aspects backgrounded (; ), addressing the person–place transactions within neighborhoods requires integrated methods. While qualitative, interpretive methods, such as narrative interviews, can be used to explore aspects of meaning, identity, and belonging (), interview-based methods have limitations. In particular, they may not capture the “nuance of daily movements, practices, and relationships” (, p. 293) and other tacit and taken-for-granted elements of daily life and places that are challenging to articulate (). In contrast, a grounding of persons in places, that considers specific objective elements and also captures the “feel” and tacit elements of locations (), can be provided through participatory geospatial methods. Such methods, defined here as those that involve participants in the production of spatial data, can also highlight temporal elements and facilitate comparison of place-related data across participants.Combined participatory geospatial and qualitative research methods are emerging in the aging literature (), such as approaches combining global positioning systems (GPS) tracking and map-based interviews (e.g., ), photovoice studies (e.g., ), or go-along approaches (e.g., ). Outside of the aging literature, combined participatory geospatial and qualitative methods have included combinations of local maps, interviews, and participant observation (), grounded theory, ethnography and mapping (), and narrative inquiry, activity diaries and sketch maps as well as incorporating qualitative analysis capabilities into geographic information systems (GIS) software (; ). Further development and refinement of these emerging methods are needed, especially within aging research. In particular, geospatial data are often not utilized to their full potential, frequently being used to support qualitative data collection (e.g., interviews informed by maps based on GPS tracking data) and thorough integration of qualitative and geospatial methods is often not achieved (). Advancing combined participatory geospatial and qualitative methods holds promise to create valuable knowledge regarding neighborhoods and aging adults and requires researchers to examine and reflect on the methods throughout the research process. To this end, the objectives of this article are:To describe a combined qualitative-geospatial approach for studying of older adults in neighborhoods.To investigate the qualitative-geospatial approach developed, including its utility and feasibility in exploring person–place transactions in neighborhoods. Methods: Development and Key Characteristics of a Qualitative-Geospatial ApproachWe conducted a study addressing two concurrent objectives: (a) to explore how neighborhood and person transact to shape social connectedness and inclusion in older adults and (b) to develop, implement, and explore the utility and feasibility of an approach combining participatory geospatial and qualitative methods. Using a community-based participatory research approach (), we formed an advisory panel of older adult community members and other community stakeholders to contribute to decision making and collaboratively implement the research approach. See  for advisory panel member characteristics. The approach is grounded in social constructivism () and integrates narrative, GPS, mapping, and ethnographic approaches, building on previous work (; ; ; ). We recruited 14 residents age 65 years or more living in two neighborhoods with diverse characteristics in a mid-sized Canadian city. Individuals were eligible to participate if they lived in one of the target neighborhoods for at least 1 year, could participate in an interview in English, were not working full-time, and were able to venture into their community. All participants included in the sample were Caucasian, reported experiencing very good or excellent health, had completed high school or higher education, and typically had money left over at the end of each month. See  for details. The study received ethical approval from the University of Western Ontario’s Non-medical Research Ethics Board. Table 1.Advisory Panel Member Characteristics  Table 2.Participant Characteristics  Data CollectionThirteen participants met with a researcher three times and participated in: (a) a narrative interview, (b) a go-along interview, and (c) GPS tracking, completing an activity/travel diary and follow-up interview. The fourteenth participant completed all but the go-along interview for health reasons and was lost to follow up. Almost all data collection sessions were completed by one researcher (R. Pack). Each session lasted 30–120 min, took place at a location of the participant’s choice, and considered the participant’s self-defined neighborhood. The order of data collection varied across participants to explore benefits and drawbacks of different sequences. Each participant received a $25 gift card of their choosing for each interview they participated in.Narrative interviews were conducted based on  open narrative elicitation process and guidelines provided by . Participants responded to the initial prompt: “I would like you to tell me what it is like for you to live in your neighborhood, now, and in the past. This might include the places you go, the things you do, and the people you see. Include anything that is important to you. Begin wherever you like.” Additional questions were integrated to further elicit narrative related to activities they do, places they go, people they interact with, change in the neighborhood or their activities over time, sense of belonging, and plans to continue living in the neighborhood as they age.Within the go-along interviews (; ; ), participants walked with the interviewer to a local destination of their choosing. Along the way the interviewer engaged the participant in an informal interview focused on the route they took, places they travelled through and visited, activities the participant engaged in, and reasons for going to these places. The interviewer also directed conversation to what they were seeing and doing and conducted participant observation, paying attention to the physical and social environment and how the participant interacted with these elements.During the GPS-related data collection participants wore a GPS device for 4 days (two weekdays and two weekend days) to collect data in time and space () and completed a diary about out-of-home activities on those specific days, including where the participant went, travel method, and social interactions. A research assistant provided instructions for using the device and contact information in case of any issues, and also contacted the participants every second day during GPS tracking to provide support if needed. Following GPS tracking the data were converted into maps and printed, with each map displaying 2 days of tracking data, along with key features of the built environment (e.g., streets, parks, places of interest) for orientation. Participants then engaged in a semistructured interview that incorporated viewing the maps and activity/travel diaries with the interviewer (i.e., map-based interviews). The researcher made notations on the maps as needed, including the places the participant went, the routes taken, the travel modes, and other meaningful places in the neighborhood. The interviews focused on the participant’s experiences of the neighborhood places they visited, whether they were typical places and activities, interactions with people in the places visited, and feelings of connectedness and inclusion in various places.The interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Immediately following each data collection session, the interviewer recorded reflexive notes. The primary interviewer (R. Pack) and principal investigator (C. Hand) met regularly to discuss on-going data collection and analysis and shared findings with the broader research team and advisory panel, engaging in a process of collective reflexivity as a way to optimize data collection and analysis (). AnalysisAnalysis addressed both the substantive study objective regarding person–place transactions that shape connectedness and inclusion in neighborhoods and the methodological objective regarding the utility and feasibility of the geospatial-qualitative approach. To achieve data immersion and familiarity with the entire data set (), initial analysis involved multiple team members reading interview transcripts and diaries and viewing maps to generate themes. One theme related to how participants connect with people as well as places in their neighborhoods, in a variety of meaningful ways. Further analysis related to the substantive objective was therefore framed by the question, How and in what ways do older adults connect with and within their neighborhoods? Although sources are available on methods of analyzing each data type as separate entities, very few address analysis in relation to other data types. Thus, we adopted an analysis process that drew on sources specific to each method and worked to combine analysis methods to understand what could be gleaned from each type of data individually and in combination. Throughout analysis, we engaged in an ongoing process of interdisciplinary discussion at advisory panel and research team meetings. Data analysis followed an iterative process as follows:Step 1: For six participants, one researcher (C. Hand) explored emerging findings by considering data for a single participant at a time. She focused on key parts of the data that helped to convey the participants’ stories of their lives in their self-defined neighborhoods and the ways in which participants connect to people and places in their neighborhoods. The process involved:Immersion in data through close reading and rereading of interview transcripts, activity/travel diaries, observation and reflexive notes, and viewing maps.Creating a synopsis of the diary data describing the person’s activities, places visited, travel modes, and interactions with others.Map visualization, a process that can facilitate exploring data in interaction with other data (), including examining how far from home the routes ranged, any areas of frequent activity, travel modes to places visited, patterns such as clustering or dispersion (), or other emerging information.Using narrative analysis techniques (), to break interview text, diary, and map data into idea units, and identify emerging themes and key storylines. The ideas and emerging themes were linked to specific times, places, and activities to further contextualize the data.Noting relationships between participants’ perceptions, activities and spatial environment and considering key quotes and emerging findings from all interview transcripts in the context of the maps and activity diary.Writing reflexive notes throughout this step.Step 2: The researcher (C. Hand) reviewed the transcripts again alongside the reflexive notes for the six participants, to characterize the nature of the data and findings that were gained through each method, again taking reflexive notes.Step 3: The researcher (C. Hand) then created a “core narrative” () for each of the six participants, focusing on how the person connects with and within their neighborhood, using approximations of the participant’s own words and direct quotes. The interviewer (R. Pack) reviewed the core narratives and provided comments about their correspondence to her own emerging sense of the participants. The researcher then looked across narratives to discern patterns in how participants connect with and within their neighborhoods. After completing this process with the six participants, three from each neighborhood, an adequate understanding of the substantive study findings was achieved. As a result, the remaining steps focused on the methodological aspects of the study.Step 4: Two team members (C. Hand and a research assistant) reviewed the data by type to generate further insights about the methods including:Viewing the 27 maps at once and performing visualization as in Step 1, comparing across and within neighborhoods.Creating synopses of the remaining activity diaries and reading all 14 as a set.Reviewing transcripts for the remaining eight map-based interviews, eight narrative interviews, and seven go-along interviews, taking each interview type as a data set.Writing reflexive notes throughout this process regarding the information that each data type was providing regarding activities, places, people, and change over time, transactions between person and place, and connections to people and places.Step 5: To address feasibility of the approach, the research assistants and principal investigator kept on-going notes on the process of data collection and all team members reflected on the methods. Results and DiscussionData and Understandings Gained Through Narrative InterviewsThe study’s narrative approach was aimed at creating in-depth stories capturing older adults’ experiences of social inclusion/exclusion and connectedness/isolation in the context of their neighborhoods, their sense of identity and activities, and aspects of time such as chronology of events and life course (). Participants had an opportunity to tell their stories, with varying content, levels of depth and detail, and story forms (). Some, like Participants 2 and 6, related detailed histories of themselves and their families describing the deep meaning that their neighborhood has had for them in the past and presently. Others, such as Participants 1 and 11, drew clear links between their own values and identities and their neighborhoods, with relatively little about their personal histories. For example, Participant 1 forefronted the friendliness of her neighborhood and how it has helped her to become connected in her new home and described the walkability and amenities that support her youthful and healthy identity. Participant 11 spoke of the fit between the features her neighborhood offers and her values such as sense of community, active living, and green space. Still other participants (3, 4, 12, 14), discussed their neighborhoods in a pragmatic way, relating facts about their own histories and activities and useful amenities in their neighborhoods such as parks, grocery stores, and banks. Participant 14 mentioned a recent, difficult transition to retirement, and rather than discuss the personal difficulties she faced, she turned the discussion toward her current life in her new home and neighborhood, which was full of activities and friends. Participant 3 also focused on her current home and activities, despite a 44-year history in the area, and provided little personal information about, for example, family or close friends. Finally, Participant 7 spoke of his neighborhood in a very knowledgeable, yet relatively impersonal way, detailing neighborhood changes over time, histories of various stores and owners, the social character of the neighborhood, local architecture, and traffic issues. Such narrative data provided insights into temporal, symbolic, pragmatic, and social elements of inclusion and connectedness and highlighted the varying ways participants construct the self in narrative and how these constructions are associated with the meaning assigned to and constructions of one’s neighborhood. Data and Understandings Gained Through Go-along InterviewsThe go-along interviews provided an opportunity to observe the participants in their neighborhoods and gain nonverbalized, situated information about the way they transact with various elements of their neighborhoods. Participants interacted with the social environment in a variety of ways, including greeting people and dogs (3, 7, 11, 12) and chatting with acquaintances and strangers in locations like banks and shops (5, 6, 11). Participant 8 was very sociable, chatting at length with people at adjacent tables in a coffee shop who were previously unknown to her. Conversely, Participant 14 stated that she avoids social contact while out on her walks, and other participants did not interact with passersby, despite their presence while walking (4, 9). Variations in how people engaged in social interactions were observable and methods of interacting in neighborhoods were identified, highlighting the important roles that neighborhood people play in the social networks of older residents (). In particular, the observations provided a window into subtle social interaction patterns that are typically not otherwise stated ().Participants also interacted with the physical environment in a variety of ways. All participants had access to parks and natural areas and about one-third of them chose to walk in these areas (3, 4, 8, 11, 14). One participant (4) chose a challenging terrain, involving cluttered paths and steep hills, providing additional insight into the participant’s abilities and interactions with his environment. The walking pace varied from fast, typically on walks that the participants usually do for exercise (3, 13, 14), to slow and leisurely (5, 6, 7). In one neighborhood, disjointed, partially blocked, or lack of sidewalks were pointed out by participants as barriers to walking (9, 13). This method therefore enabled an understanding of taken-for-granted physical elements of both spaces and persons that shaped how participants navigated their neighborhoods.Being and doing activities in the neighborhood prompted a variety of emotional responses in the participants, providing a window to emotional and symbolic elements of person–place transactions. Some expressed enjoyment at going on a favorite walk (3) and sharing local history with the interviewer (7) or enthusiasm at seeing wildlife (8). Other participants expressed a lack of enjoyment, articulating lack of places to visit or disgust at local amenities.The choice of route and destination for the go-along interviews, combined with comments made in the interviews, revealed meaning about how the person connects and transacts with their neighborhood. Participant 7 took the interviewer on a tour of historically meaningful neighborhood places, and seemed to connect to the neighborhood through his interest in and extensive knowledge about local geography and history. Participant 2 provided a reminiscent “family history tour” of her neighborhood, displaying the breadth of her connections to neighborhood places and discussing especially meaningful places. Participant 4 chose a route that he had often taken to work but no longer travels, and related a relatively factual description of living and working in the area. Participant 1 had lived in the area for only a few years and provided a tour of neighborhood places, demonstrating her knowledge of the area. Two additional participants took the interviewer on a favorite walk (6, 11). Other participants chose routes and destinations that seemed to hold less personal meaning that were reflective of their typical neighborhood activities, such as walking in a park or neighborhood streets (3, 8, 13, 14) or to a local shopping area (5, 9, 12). The routes taken demonstrated how neighborhoods can form a spatial biography, via personal landmarks that hold past, present, or future meaning to the person ().Finally, during the go-along interviews, elements of the neighborhood acted as interview prompts or “walking probes” (). Participants related stories of themselves in their neighborhood based on places and people they saw. They mentioned details that did not come up in the other sessions, for example, noting specific busy streets that were challenging to cross (6). Seeing certain locations prompted discussion about the people who are associated with them, illuminating the individual’s network of local social connections, in particular peripheral ties (). Thus, go-along interviews can stimulate unplanned situations, thoughts, and remembrances that may not be mentioned in a sit-down interview ().The concept of “being in place” with participants () appears to be a key component and benefit of go-along interviews. Being in context with and observing participants who can share “what is going on” () enables researchers to gain deep and detailed understandings of life in neighborhoods (). Researchers can gain understanding of participants’ experiences of the physical and social spaces of their neighborhoods (), their unique perceptions of their environment, and what those perceptions might relate to, such as emotions, tastes, experiences, and social contexts (). The historical and geographical details noted by Participant 7 illustrated his unique perception of his neighborhood that could be clearly linked to his practical knowledge () as a geographer. Go-along interviews further enable researchers to learn about the “spatial practices” of participants, or the ways that individuals engage with their environments (). Participants in the current study engaged socially, physically and emotionally with their neighborhoods and communicated the subtle layered meanings of these spatial practices (). Data and Understandings Gained Through GPS and Related Data CollectionActivity/Travel DiariesThe activity/travel diaries provided a sense of each participant’s daily lives in their communities, in contrast to the broader temporal frame often employed in the narrative interviews. While the narrative interviews highlighted the activities that participants connected to their identities and the meaning assigned to the neighborhood, the diaries illuminated the everyday, routine activities that were often not mentioned in either narratives or go-along interviews, such as shopping trips or walks in the neighborhood. Patterns could be determined within and across diaries, such as differences in travel or activities across neighborhoods, outings per day, typical travel mode, and weekend versus weekday activities. For example, across both study neighborhoods participants tended to spend time seeing family or attending religious services on weekends and did more structured activities like clubs, exercise groups, or cards during the week. GPS Maps and DataThe maps and numerical GPS data enabled researchers to construct further understandings about the activities in place, the neighborhood context, and the ways in which older adults interlink with neighborhood features. Viewing the maps enabled the researchers to determine the boundaries of the area each participant typically travelled within, the mode of transport (i.e., driving, walking or cycling), typical and infrequent routes, and use of local amenities. The maps allowed further integration of the GPS data with other geospatial data regarding neighborhood environments by displaying local places such as parks and shopping areas.  provides sample findings based on map and diary data, highlighting the comparisons that can be drawn across neighborhoods and  and  provide sample maps. Table 3.Sample Study Findings Comparing Study Neighborhoods Based on Map and Diary Data  Figure 1.Routes travelled by Participant 1 on 2 days (Day 1 to a grocery store, library, restaurant, and church and day 2 to thrift store, family centre, and shopping mall). All travel was by car.Figure 1.Routes travelled by Participant 1 on 2 days (Day 1 to a grocery store, library, restaurant, and church and day 2 to thrift store, family centre, and shopping mall). All travel was by car. Figure 2.Routes travelled by Participant 2 on 2 days (Day 1 to a number of marked locations by car, and day 2 on foot in a rough circle just north of home).Figure 2.Routes travelled by Participant 2 on 2 days (Day 1 to a number of marked locations by car, and day 2 on foot in a rough circle just north of home).The numerical GPS data provided quantitative information, for example, about the size of participant’s activity spaces, total distance travelled, and proportion of time spent walking versus driving. The visual map data and numerical data about activity patterns provided additional, richer context that expanded findings from the map-based interview data (). Map-Based InterviewsThe map-based interviews drew upon the maps and diaries to provide a more comprehensive sense of the participants’ daily lives in their communities. Participants described their activities, places they visit, and people they interact with and their reasons for engaging in these activities. Many reasons were pragmatic, such as the convenience and prices of certain grocery stores, whereas others were more personal, such as the meaning of a certain place, or the enjoyment the person gets from a particular activity. Participant values often played a role in activity choices, for instance valuing a youthful identity and participating in mixed age groups, (1) avoiding senior centre activities (5) or shopping locally to help local businesses (7). In some cases, discussion of participant values occurred in the narrative interviews and the map-based interviews served to elicit specific details about how values are enacted. Further, the visual representation in the maps, and the specific questions in the diaries, provided valuable interview prompts (). The breadth of details that participants provided regarding why they do certain activities illustrates the value of this method of data collection. The methods elicited information that was not gained through the more typical, narrative interviews, in particular, highlighting peripheral, yet important, social connections. Other authors have noted the value of activity tracking and map-based interviews for exploring the “taken-for-granted” aspects of aging in neighborhoods () and eliciting multilayered detail about everyday experiences (). Reflections on the Combined MethodsAs discussed above, each method seemed to fulfill a different purpose and provided different perspectives about the participants and their transactional relationships with neighborhoods, despite some overlap of content. We chose to combine spatial and qualitative methods primarily for two reasons related to exploring spatial, social, perceptual, and other elements of person–place transactions: first, to directly place the person in the context under study, thus capturing the objective and tacit elements of place and the person’s experiences of place and second, to explore meanings and interpretations.  outlined 16 reasons for combining quantitative and qualitative data, several of which apply to our combination of spatial and qualitative methods. These include ensuring completeness of data and findings, explaining the findings of one method through the other, enhancing the integrity of the findings, illustrating one type of data through another, and enhancing the findings of one method using another method. Conceptions of NeighborhoodThe combination of methods helped us to better understand participants’ conceptions and boundaries of neighborhood. For example, on Participant 2’s go-along interview, she took the interviewer to a home a family member had built, that was technically outside the city-defined boundaries of the neighborhood, but that the participant identifies as part of her neighborhood. Participant 8’s map-based interview showed she goes to many places in the city core, outside of what is generally considered her neighborhood, but that she considers to be her community. The participants also revealed conceptions about neighborhood that they did not explicitly state. In the narrative interview, Participant 3 stated that she considered her neighborhood to be her condo complex; within the map-based interview, she stated that she is very familiar with the wider area and would never consider moving to the north-end of town, implying a wider conception of neighborhood than she previously stated. The combination of methods enabled us to go beyond triangulation and identifying points of agreement, to embrace crystallization, that is, using different methods to achieve a more complex, in-depth, and dynamic understanding () of meanings of neighborhood and its boundaries. Connecting in NeighborhoodsIntegrating the different types of data helped to create a rich and full understanding of how the participants connect with and within their neighborhoods. For instance, for Participant 2, who has a deep and meaningful family history in the area, her stories were overlaid on her map. We marked such places as her grandmother’s previous home and restaurant, her grandfather’s previous store and her mother’s previous rooming house. By placing and noting these locations on the map, we get a sense of what she means about her deep and meaningful connections. We see how far ranging her connections are, providing additional context for her connections to place demonstrated within her go-along interview. The combination of methods also provided a means to understand how participants actively negotiated connecting in neighborhoods. For example, in the map-based interview Participant 9 described some of her current social activities and connections and the value she places on helping others. In the narrative interview she articulated a tension between wanting to help others, and experiences that older, frail neighbors can become overly dependent on her. She described negotiating this tension by avoiding getting too close to older neighbors. Agency Within ParticipantsA narrative inquiry approach is often used to illuminate agency of participants, shifting their position from passive interviewees, to storytellers who craft their own narratives. Participants set the form and content of their stories, determine their beginning and end, and determine what to include and not to include (e.g., ). The other methods we used also offered participants ways to enact agency, for example, through choosing the go-along interview routes and destinations, recording specific activities in the diaries and GPS tracking, and telling stories about their own activities in the map-based interviews. The methods appeared to flatten hierarchies among researcher and participant () and encourage enthusiasm and in-depth participation in the research (), enabling coconstruction of findings regarding person–place transactions (). Embodied and Enacted TransactionsIncluding methods that are grounded in the participants’ environment enriched understanding of their transactions with the neighborhood in a variety of meaningful ways. For example, Participant 9’s activity diary described walking in the neighborhood and the map-based interview revealed that lack of sidewalks was an issue. Participant 9’s go-along interview on a typical walk allowed the interviewer to see the participant negotiating the lack of sidewalks and walking in the road, and discussing instances when it is unsafe and safe to do. The social environment could also be observed, revealing new data that had not been mentioned previously, specifically, that the participant encounters very few people walking in the neighborhood. In the narrative interview, Participant 3 mentioned her enjoyment of walking, and her habit of walking frequently. In her go-along interview, involving fast-paced pole-walking in a nearby park, she seemed to enact the meaning of walking for her, involving an active, healthy identity and opportunities to greet, and interact with pets and people. Participant 3 also talked about her activity-based communities for golf and bridge and how important these were to her. The GPS data showed that these activities occur at locations several kilometers from home, suggesting another aspect to her level of commitment to the activities. Transactions Between Person and Place as an Ongoing ProcessThe combination of methods was useful in understanding participants’ lives in neighborhoods as an active process that is negotiated over time (), at different scales. Looking across Participant 9’s data illustrated the processes that she engaged in. In her narrative interview, she spoke about moving into her condo building, wanting something to do, and walking to a nearby senior’s club that she continues to attend. Her map-based interview provided many details of her activities and interactions at the senior’s club, including the relationships she has developed, leading to additional social activities, and club responsibilities she has taken on over time. In her go-along interview, she talked about possibilities that were not currently open to her, the lack of resources in her area, and that she is “making the best of what’s there in the neighborhood.” The different forms of data collection provided a window into the ongoing process of connecting with others and engaging in neighborhoods. During data collection, participants also described their lives at different temporal scales, from their small daily habits to their experiences over the course of a lifetime. Participant 6 described walking in her neighborhood as a teenager, then as a young mother and currently as an older woman, and how these repeated, long-standing experiences create a sense of connection to and belonging in her neighborhood. The local shops that she visits and her daily walking habits in her neighborhood were also described as ways she creates a deeper sense of familiarity and connectedness to place. Sequence of Data CollectionThe order in which data collection took place varied across participants and provides some insight into what the different methods may offer. Data from each method generally built on ideas from previous methods and created a deeper understanding of the participant’s experiences. For example, Participant 1, in her narrative and first interview, described why she likes her neighborhood, how she is trying to meet people in her new community and some of the activities she does and places she goes. This information provided context for the map-based interview that further described the participant’s activities and travels. The final, go-along interview was a tour of the area, including several of the places the participant had mentioned in interviews, providing visual information about the participant’s neighborhood experiences. In other cases, the methods did not provide scaffolded understandings but instead provided new information; for example, Participant 6’s go-along and final interview included new details about the neighborhood, such as noting specific busy streets that are difficult to cross. The repeated sessions seemed to give participants the opportunity reflect on their comments, clarify points from previous interviews, and add new information. These activities occurred regardless of the sequence of methods.Irrespective of order, the map-based interviews tended to prompt participants to describe their current activities and places they visit, along with explanations of why they do these activities and what they like about them, in a more factual and less reflective way than other interviews. The narrative interviews tended to be more reflective and personal, regardless of the order they occurred, although in some cases (e.g., 4), the go-along was the most personal and reflective interview. Practicality and Feasibility of MethodsIn general, the methods were implemented successfully. The participants all actively engaged in data collection and appeared comfortable with the process. The participants did not appear to have any difficulty understanding or completing the activity diaries or using the GPS devices, with the exception of occasionally forgetting to turn on the device. In some cases, the GPS device did not work properly and a research assistant provided support to resolve the issue. Within the go-along interviews, noise such as from traffic occasionally obscured the voices on the audio recordings, while at the same time providing useful, unstated information about the neighborhood context. Flexibility in scheduling was required for the go-along interviews, which were occasionally rescheduled due to weather or health issues. In terms of resources, data collection and analysis involved a large time commitment from participants and researchers alike. The data could be further explored, displayed and integrated with other geospatial data (e.g., environmental, socioeconomic) within GIS software, to facilitate more efficient handling and deeper analyses of large amounts of data. Other resources required for the interviews were minimal, including transcription and equipment costs. In contrast, the GPS-related data collection required the use of a GPS device, research assistant support to solve any technical issues, technical services to analyze the GPS data and create the maps, and printing services. ImplicationsWe successfully implemented a combined qualitative-participatory geospatial approach to the study of person–place transactions among older adults in neighborhoods. Combining the methods in a novel way and purposefully reflecting on their implementation enabled us to demonstrate the value of the developed approach. The approach was grounded in the context and complexity of participants’ daily lives and as such provided rich data and insight into older adults’ lives in neighborhoods. Each method brought unique insights to the study. Participants construct temporal, symbolic, pragmatic, and social meanings of their neighborhoods, demonstrated in the narrative interviews. The go-along interviews provided insights into how participants transact with their neighborhoods in often subtle and nonverbalized ways, socially, physically, and emotionally. The activity/travel diaries provided a sense of each participant’s daily lives in their communities and the maps and numerical GPS data provided meaningful context that complemented the interview data. The map-based interviews further generated layered meanings about participants’ daily lives in their communities. Together, the methods shed light on conceptions of neighborhood and connecting in neighborhoods, provided opportunities for participants to enact agency and person–place transactions in situ, and demonstrated the temporal nature of person–place transactions.Future research can apply the developed approach within a specific methodology, such as ethnographic research, in order to further situate findings in relation to broader cultural factors, or grounded theory, as a means to contribute to mapping out a social process. Nuanced, contextualized information about older adults’ lives in neighborhoods can be used in several ways. For example, emerging study findings suggest the ways in which older adults exert influence on their neighborhoods, such as reaching out to neighbors to create a sense of community or advocating for the city to address issues like graffiti. These actions position older adults as active agents in the neighborhood and suggest that such older adults could contribute to change at the neighborhood level. At the same time, recognizing the tensions that older adults may feel in assisting and care-giving for neighbors can help to contextualize reluctance to reach out. Understanding how older adults navigate the absence of sidewalks, or use sidewalks as places for socializing, could inform city planning regarding infrastructure. Seniors’ programming could incorporate the meaning that neighborhood places have for older adults, through using local, meaningful sites for events or incorporating neighborhood concepts into activities, for example. Finally, exploring the many ways in which under-resourced neighborhoods can create exclusion and isolation in older adults could suggest policy directions aimed at improving well-being. Such research, which considers the dynamic and interconnected nature of person and place, the complexity of person–place transactions, and is directly grounded in the environments of participants’ lives, can generate much-needed knowledge to support aging in neighborhoods.

References Issue Section:, AbstractPurpose of the StudyEnvironmental factors play an important role in the quality of life of older people who often have difficulty maintaining physical, psychological, and social functioning. In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults’ perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics.Design and MethodsAssociations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the “Senioren Barometer.” Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF.ResultsSeven scales (comprising 3–9 items) of environment were constructed—housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental.ImplicationsThis study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance. , , , , It is projected that by 2050 33.2% and by 2100 36.6% of the population of the Netherlands will be 60 and over (). To cope with the challenges of this rapidly aging population, the Dutch government has changed their policy on the care for older people; older people are motivated to “aging in place,” defined as remaining living in their own home and environment as long as possible, even if they are frail. This is favored by many older people themselves () and avoids the costly option of institutionalization, which is now restricted to severely dependent older people. To support independent living in older people, health and social care professionals may need to carry out interventions delaying hospitalization or institutionalization, or focusing on aspects of quality of life aiming to enhance well-being. Because people are supposed to live at home longer, it has been becoming increasingly important to obtain insight into the effects of environmental factors on quality of life.Quality of life has been defined by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Group as “an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value system in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” (, p. 1405). Several concepts are related to quality of life, including life satisfaction and well-being. It is suggested that well-being should include individuals’ moods, emotions, and cognitive evaluations of life satisfaction (); life satisfaction has been equated with happiness () and can be considered as a subtheme of well-being and quality of life ().Environmental factors play an important role in the quality of life of older people (), who often have difficulty maintaining physical, psychological, and social functioning. According to the general ecological model of aging (), a person’s functioning is the result of their physical, psychological and social resources, environmental factors and the fit between ever-changing individuals and their ever-changing environments; both the individuals’ competencies and the demands of environmental factors change as part of the process of aging. One of these environmental factors is the built environment, defined as is the objective and perceived characteristics of the physical context in which people spend their time (e.g., home, neighborhood), including aspects of detailed design (e.g., sidewalks and seating), traffic density and speed, locations for physical activity (e.g., streets and parks), crime and safety (). As people age, multimorbidity, disability, and frailty create special needs, but a responsive built environment can possibly reduce the impact of these conditions. The built environment may affect aging actively and remaining independent (); for example, changes at home such as introducing mobility aids can enhance independence. The effect of the built environment on quality of life in older adults is particularly relevant since this age group spends more time at home in comparison to younger adults ().An essential environmental factor belonging to the built environment and strongly influencing the quality of life older people is the neighborhood (). Among perceived neighborhood characteristics, safety from traffic was positively associated with physical and mental dimensions of quality of life. Having positive perceptions of characteristics of neighborhood safety has also been related to a lower prevalence of mental health in older adults (). Other studies demonstrated an association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in older men () and an association between neighborhood context and late-life cognitive function (). The Alabama Country Study found that functionally healthy people aged 55 years and older who reported problematic neighborhood environments (e.g., heavy traffic, excessive noise, inadequate lighting) had a higher risk of functional deterioration over 1 year compared with those in better neighborhoods ().Neighborhood characteristics requiring specific attention are social participation and engagement in the neighborhood, the key components of social capital, defined as social networks and norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness (). Higher social capital is positively associated with the mental as well as the physical dimensions of quality of life (); in addition, higher social capital is shown to be important for health () and wellbeing () and has been associated with reduced mortality for persons 45–64 years () and with a lower prevalence of mental health in older adults ().In conclusion, previous research has shown the importance of environmental factors for quality of life in older adults (e.g., characteristics of the built environment, housing, neighborhood, indicators of social capital). The aim of the present study is twofold. First, we assess the dimensional structure of older adults’ perceptions of their environment, and construct scales for these environmental factors.  concluded that among 19 articles using a subjective measure of environment, only one standardized scale was used: the Neighborhood Environment Walking Scale (NEWS). The NEWS is validated and involves nine environmental factors at the neighborhood level (e.g., neighborhood satisfaction, crime, and safety); however, elderly based validation is needed (). Therefore, we decided to construct another instrument of environmental factors based on responses of adults of 50 years and older to 42 items concerning their living environment. Second, using the environmental factors derived from this newly developed instrument, we examine the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics. Our study is motivated by the realization that it is important for health and well-being promotion policies to take into account the complexity of the environmental context in which older people’s everyday lives are spent. MethodsStudy Population and Data CollectionThe “Senioren Barometer,” initiated by the Academic Collaborative Center Policy for the Elderly and Informal Care (Tranzo, Tilburg University), is a web-based questionnaire to assess the opinion of a panel of Dutch older people (aged 50 years and older) about different aspects of life. Older people can volunteer and participation is always without obligation. For more information concerning the “Senioren Barometer” we refer the reader to previous stu dies that have used this questionnaire (; ).In the period December 2009 and January 2010, 1,942 people aged 50 years and older completed this questionnaire containing questions about environmental factors, frailty, disability, and quality of life. We excluded 450 cases from further analyses because of one or more missing values for environmental factors and quality of life, yielding a sample size of 1,492. Whereas all data were used in the factor analysis, only the data of individuals aged 65 years and older (1,031 cases) () were used for all other analyses.The study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. Medical ethics approval was not necessary as particular treatments or interventions were not offered or withheld from respondents. The integrity of respondents was not encroached upon as a consequence of participating in the study, which is the main criterion in medical ethical procedures in the Netherlands (). Informed consent, in terms of information-giving and maintaining confidentiality, was respected. MeasuresQuality of LifeQuality of life was assessed by the World Health Organization’s Quality of Life Instrument–Short Version (WHOQOL-BREF), a 26-item self-administered scale, covering four domains—physical health (seven items), psychological (six items), social relations (three items), environmental (eight items), and includes one overall QOL item and one general heath item (). Since we were primarily interested in effects of environmental factors on quality of life domains, we used only the 24 domain items. All items were rated on a 5-point scale with a higher score indicating a higher quality of life. The scores ranged from 4 to 20 for each quality of life domain (). Studies in various countries have shown that the WHOQOL-BREF has suitable psychometric performance for measuring health-related quality of life in older people (; ). Environmental FactorsThe questionnaire contained 42 questions on participants’ perceptions of their environment. Because the Senioren Barometer was already in existence before we conducted our study, we had no influence on the questionnaire’s content. With the exception of two questions, these items and their response categories are summarized in the first column of the table in the . The two items not included in the table of the  are “living in a house for sale or a rental property” and “satisfaction about neighborhood, expressed in a report rating.” These items were excluded because they could not be incorporated in the scales we created for the environmental factors (see below in the Results section). Background CharacteristicsThe sociodemographic background characteristics considered were age (in years), sex, marital status (five categories), highest education attained (five categories) and net income (with nine categories) (see  for the answe ring categories). Analysis StrategiesFirst, descriptive statistics were provided for background characteristics and quality of life domains. Second, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to construct environmental factors based on responses to the 42 environment items. PCA is a technique to construct one or more relatively independent measurements based on commonalities of items, resulting in measurements that are more reliable than individual items. We used the responses of all 1,492 individuals of 50 years and older in the PCA. We used all data because the environmental factors should hold for older as well as middle-aged adults, and factor analysis and scale construction benefit from using as much re levant information as possible. However, because environmental factors may differ between relatively younger (age 50–65 years) and older (≥65 years) persons, we also briefly present the PCA and scaling results based on only the older persons.Arguably the most important phase of PCA is factor retention. We applied three factor retention methods; the scree plot, parallel analysis (), and the empirical Kaiser criterion (). Parallel analysis has generally shown the best performance in simulation studies and is often recommended (). The empirical Kaiser criterion, however, outperforms parallel analysis when subscales are correlated and contain few items. For factor retention, we also applied a second recommended strategy, which is to only retain a factor having at least three items (i) with sufficiently high factor loadings (at least 0.3, preferably much higher if the number of items loading on the factor is small), and that (ii) load higher on this factor than on other factors (). Ultimately, we selected the maximum number of factors that each had at least three items, with the number of factors being equal to or smaller than those identified by the three factor retention methods. Items that did not satisfy the two requirements were discarded for scale construction. After identifying the scales of environmental factors, they were labeled using the content of the items of each scale, and total scores were computed for all scales. Scales’ (Cronbach’s alpha) reliabilities and corrected-item-total total correlations as well as factor loadings (obtained with PCA using Oblimin rotation) were also computed and reported.Variables were coded for analysis according to a previous study in which we used the “Senioren Barometer” (); dummies were created for sex (“1” woman, “0” men), marital status (“1” married or cohabiting, “0” rest), and linear effects of age, education, and income were incorporated into the analyses. Ethnicity was excluded because of the low frequency of non-Dutch participants (3.8%).After carrying out bivariate regression analyses, we tested our main hypotheses on the effects of environmental scales on quality of life by carrying out hierarchical regression analyses in two steps for each of the four quality of life domains. In the first step, only the background or control variables were entered, and second, all environmental scales were entered. Explained variances and increase thereof were tested and reported; we interpreted effect sizes of environment scales on quality of life using Cohen’s f2 (small is .02; medium is .15; large is .35) (). Unstandardized regression coefficients, as well as their standard errors and p values were reported.For statistical analysis, IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used. ResultsParticipant CharacteristicsThe participants’ mean age was 73.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 5.8); 66.8% were men and 71.1% were married or cohabiting.  presents the descriptive statistics of all the background characteristics and the means, standard deviations and range of the seven environmental factors, and the four quality of life domains, respectively. The reliabilities of the physical health, psychological, social relations, environment domains of the WHOQOL-BREF were .836, .751, .579, .781, respectively. Table 1.Participant Characteristics (N = 1,031) a119 missing values. Scale ConstructionBoth the scree plot () as well as parallel analysis suggested retaining seven (7th eigenvalue = 1.365), whereas the empirical Kaiser criterion suggested nine components (9th eigenvalue = 1.055). Because both the 8-component and 9-component solutions did not satisfy our requirements (i.e., one component contained less than three items loading highest on that component, with loadings higher than 0.3), we retained seven components. The seven components explained 56.8% of the variance of all 40 items.  reports scales for environmental factors, with items (wording and response categories) and their psychometric properties, and scale reliabilities. We also ran analyses on the subset of 1,031 persons (69.1%) of 65 years and older. The scree plot suggested seven, whereas parallel analysis and the empirical Kaiser criterion suggested 8 (8th eigenvalue = 1.191) and 10 components, respectively (10th eigenvalue = 1.001). Seven components explained 55.7% of the variance of 40 items. Using the same scales as for all 1,492 persons resulted in essentially similar reliabilities (at most 0.047 less for the older group than for the whole group), and all items had corrected-item total correlations larger than 0.3, which together demonstrate the validity of the seven environmental scales for the older group. Figure 1.Scree plot of PCA on 40 items concerning older adults’ (aged 50 years or older) perceptions of their environment.Figure 1.Scree plot of PCA on 40 items concerning older adults’ (aged 50 years or older) perceptions of their environment. shows the correlations between the seven environmental scales and their statistical significance. Nuisance had the strongest correlations with other environmental scales—0.503, 0.498, and 0.415 with residents, traffic, and stench/noise, respectively. Table 2.Correlations Between Environmental Scales *p < .05. ***p < .001. Regression Analyses: Effects of Environmental Scales on Quality of Life Domains presents the results of the bivariate regression ana lyses. Of the background variables higher age, marital status (being married or cohabiting), and higher income were associated with higher scores on all quality of life domains. Women had lower scores on quality of life domains physical health and psychological, whereas higher education was associated with higher scores on physical health, psychological, and environmental. The results of the bivariate regression analyses also show that all seven environmental factors were associated with all four quality of life domains (p ≤ .01). Table 3.Effect of Background Characteristics and Environmental Factors on Quality of Life Domains Note: Two-tailed p-values <.05 are printed in bold. also presents the results of the hierarchical regression analyses. The lines “ΔR2” indicate how much of the variance of each quality of life domain was explained by all the predictors in the first block (background characteristics) and by all the predictors in the second block (environmental factors); R2 total (last row) refers to the explained variance of the four quality of life domains by all 12 predictors together. R2 total shows that 13.0% (social relations) to 38.9% (environmental) of the variance of the quality of life domains was explained by all the predictors together.The background variables explained 4.1% to 15.4% (for social and environmental domain, respectively) of quality of life. Controlling for the effects of the other background variables, women on average had lower scores on the physical and higher scores on the social domain of quality of life. Age was negatively associated with the physical and environmental domain, and being married or cohabiting was positively associated with the social domain. Higher income was associated with higher scores on three domains (physical health, psychological, environmental), whereas education had no effect controlled for the other effects.After controlling for the effect of the background variables, the seven environmental factors together explained a statistically significant (p < .001) part of the variance of the four quality of life domains. These effects amount to a large effect on environmental quality of life domain (f2 = .25) and small to medium effects on the other domains (f2 = .047 for social, f2 = .074 for the psychological, and f2 = .101 for the physical domain).Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with four, three, and two quality of life domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with the environmental domain. The effects of individual predictors, controlled for the other predictors, were generally small; the largest effect was of facilities on the environmental domain, with f2 = .036. DiscussionPrevious research has shown that environmental factors play an important role in the quality of life in older adults (). In the present study, we aimed to construct scales of environmental factors based on responses to 42 items, and examined the associations of these scales with four quality of life domains (physical health, psychological, social relations, environmental) in a Dutch sample of adults aged 65 years and older.PCA and factor retention methods resulted in the following seven scales of environmental factors—housing, nuisance, facilities, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. The internal consistency reliability of all these scales was sufficient to good. As expected, hierarchical regression analyses showed a large effect of the seven environmental scales on quality of life domain environmental. However, we also found small to medium effects of the environmental scales on the other three quality of life domains, after controlling for background characteristics.Comparing the results of our study with those of previous studies is complicated by the fact that we developed and used seven environmental scales that were assessed differently from other existing measures (e.g., they used different items), but may have used the same labels (e.g., “neighborhood”). When interpreting our results in relation to other studies’ findings below, we consider both contents and labels of other existing measures.In our study, only environmental scale housing was associated with all quality of life domains, which agrees with previous findings.  concluded that housing-related variables explained a substantial portion of variance in life satisfaction of older adults (55–99 years old), and  found that substandard housing quality contributed to lower psychological well-being, after controlling for socioeconomic status, employment status, gender, and marital status. Moreover, various studies found an association between the number of rooms in the house, satisfaction with housing, and housing quality on the one hand, and depression prevalence on the other hand (; ).The residents scale was associated with quality of life domains psychological, social relations, and environmental. This scale contains items referring to social capital such as interactions between different groups and involvement of the local residents with their own neighborhood. Our findings concur with  who found that a higher level of neighborhood cohesion was associated with higher quality of life in a community-dwelling U.S. Chinese population, and with a Dutch study among independently living older people aged ≥ 70 years showing the importance of social capital within the neighborhood for well-being (). Social capital within a neighborhood might influence well-being through psychosocial processes such as the provision of affective support and the enhancement of self-esteem and mutual respect ().The nuisance scale was associated with quality of life physical health and environmental. This scale contains items referring to feeling safe or related expressions such as fear of crime, and social insecurity. Our findings are consistent with  who suggest that these feelings are related to the most serious problems afflicting individuals and communities, and with prior studies concluding that feelings of lack of safety among older people can have negative consequences in health () and lower psychological wellbeing ().The facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic scales were associated only with quality of life domain environmental. The facilities scale refers to a wide variety of facilities such as sport, recreation, shopping as well as public transport. Currently, findings about most of the effects of these facilities on quality of life in older people are still largely lacking. Because facilities are relevant for older people, we recommend more research into effects of facilities on quality of life in this age group.Concerning neighborhood quality,  found that it explained life satisfaction of community-dwelling individuals aged 65–94 years, using a scale covering items such as having clean sidewalks and streets. Others studies demonstrated that access to green spaces was essential for quality of life; it improves mental wellbeing (), and allows people to escape from the stress of everyday life (). In general, quiet areas were found to have higher mean WHOQOL-BREF domain scores than noisy areas (). As far as we know, no previous studies exist regarding the effects of coffee shops, the restaurant and bar market, and industry on quality of life in older people.Traffic was also associated only with quality of life domain environmental. This finding is partly contradicting some previous studies (; ). For instance,  showed that scores on all four quality of life domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (physical health, psychological, social relations, environmental) were lower in people living close to the motorway, and these scores correlated negatively with noise sensitivity in those who lived near motorways. A possible explanation for the different findings is the contextual and cultural differences between the countries involved; that is, Dutch traffic conditions may vary less within the country than in other countries, or countries’ citizens may react systematically differently to traffic across countries.Some limitations of our study must be noted in interpreting the results of our study. First, the sample is not representative for the population of adults aged 65 years and older, due to possible selection bias because the questionnaire “Senioren Barometer” had to be completed via the internet. In addition, 66.8% of the sample consisted of men, while of the Dutch population aged 65 years and over, only 44.4% is men (). Second, we developed our seven scales using a Dutch sample of older people; the scales may not all be equally relevant for populations of other countries or other age groups. Future research may validate the scales in other settings. Third, we used cross-sectional data, making the establishment of a causal link between environment and quality of life impossible; we recommend a longitudinal study focusing on the effects of environmental factors on quality of life.Fourth, one may consider the fact that we did not control for frailty or disability in our analysis as a limitation of our study. After careful deliberation, we decided not to control for frailty and disability in our prediction of quality of life, even though these variables are in our data set. We chose not to control for them because frailty and disability are together with quality of life affected by environmental factors, and these three dependent variables are likely quite strongly correlated. Hence, controlling for frailty and disability would remove a large part of quality of life from our analyses, a part we are also interested in to predict with the environmental factors. Nevertheless, we also ran our main analyses with controlling for both frailty and disability. As expected, total explained variances were much higher (between 0.204 for social relations and 0.538 for physical health). However, results on effects of environmental factors on quality of life domains were very similar to those presented in ; environmental factors added to the explanation of all quality of life domains, housing and residents affected three domains, and all factors affected the environmental quality of life domain after controlling for frailty and disability. Thus, controlling for frailty and dis ability in our analyses does not affect our main conclusions.Finally, in this study we used a self-report questionnaire for collecting data regarding environmental factors. Some other studies assessed environmental factors through the combination of objective and self-rated measures (; ), which may provide a more comprehensive assessment of environmental factors () and a broader perspective on associations between these factors and quality of life ().  found more associations between environmental perceptions and quality of life than associations with objective measures. However, some evidence suggest that objective and perceived (self-rated) measures capture different constructs of wellbeing (), and perceptions seem to be more closely related to mental and cognitive processes that directly influence quality of life (). A final limitation refers to studies’ different operationalization of the environmental factors, which complicates interpreting and comparing findings across studies. Research on the effect of environmental factors would profit from standardized measures of environment. Our study and seven scales may be considered a step in that direction.In conclusion, we offer health and social care professionals, as well as policy makers, an instrument for measuring seven separate environmental factors. Our study has shown that in particular housing, residents, and nuisance influence quality of life in older adults. We therefore re commend focusing interventions primarily on these three environmental factors aiming to enhance quality of life of older people, thereby facilitating “aging in place,” the preference of older people who are currently living in the community. Our results suggest that, for instance, home modifications such as a chair elevator as well as the use of smart home technology, may make a home more suitable for older persons, particularly if they are frail and disabled, thereby improving their quality of life. In addition, reporting by older people of unsafe conditions in the neighborhood needs to be encouraged and facilitated. In the end, more research on effectiveness of interventions, and an integrated neighborhood approach is needed, characterized by collaboration among municipalities, health and social care organizations, and residents, aiming to use available neighborhood resources effectively and increase responsiveness to older people’s specific needs ().

References Issue Section:Supplementary data - docx file, AbstractPurpose of the StudyThis article evaluates the influence of local district conditions on subjective quality of life of older South African adults. Policymakers increasingly recognize that “successful” aging policies must not only address physical health needs but also factors that influence subjective well-being.Design and MethodsTo investigate the influence of area-level distribution of “public goods” on well-being in a low- and middle-income setting, nationally representative WHO-Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey data is combined with district-level data that captures built resources and health system distribution. Multilevel regression modeling is utilized to explore how community context, including built resources and health infrastructure quality, influence older persons’ quality of life and how chronic health conditions may moderate this relationship while controlling for important individual characteristics.ResultsWhile controlling for individual and district level factors, it is found community level provision of built resources of basic services (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity, housing) has a modest but significant impact on older persons’ subjective well-being. Further, this effect on older persons’ perceptions of quality of life is moderated by individual chronic health status; individuals with a chronic health condition do not receive an equivalent benefit from district built condition like those without an illness do.ImplicationsThis work adds to the literature concerning the effect of environments in low- and middle-income countries on older adults’ subjective well-being. It also adds to the growing literature on the complex relationship between subjective well-being and health in diverse contexts. , , ,  IntroductionSouth Africa has one of the fastest-aging populations on the continent; the United Nations predicts that between 2009 and 2050, the country’s population over the age of 50 will double to 14% (). Many countries, including South Africa, want to help their populations “age well” and are beginning to understand that aging well includes not only an absence of disease and illness but also an enhancement of an individual’s subjective well-being (; ). Both subjective well-being (i.e., perceived quality of life) and better physical health are indicators of “aging well” and may reflect an individual’s access to community resources and “public goods.” This is particularly true for older adults who “age in place.” Such adults rely on family and the local community for resources and generally do not age in an institutional setting (). In South Africa, most adults age in place, which makes it an ideal location to examine how community context shapes subjective well-being and health outcomes for the aged.However, until recently, few data sources have been available to investigate the health and subjective well-being of older adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa (). Most of this research has been done in the United States or other high-income countries and may not apply to other contexts (; ). Also, the existing literature on how community context influences health has focused largely on income inequality only, not community resources or infrastructure, and has not examined the role of place beyond a simple rural/urban distinction. Perhaps most important, few studies have investigated the role of community resources in terms of physical health alongside subjective well-being, even though health and well-being are thought to have a reciprocal relationship (). The purpose of this study is to examine a nationally representative sample from a middle-income country (South Africa) to determine how health and local community resources affect older adults’ subjective well-being. By using unique measures of area-level “public goods” that may be more relevant for subjective well-being than traditional measures of income or public spending, in particular in an emerging economy such as South Africa’s, this study will improve our understanding of what contributes to successful aging in place. Also, this study is important as one of the few studies that use multilevel modeling to investigate contextual effects on individual subjective well-being while controlling for individual characteristics. Theoretical Framework and Past LiteratureCommunity Context—Built ResourcesAlthough the gerontology literature largely agrees that both social and physical environments contribute to aging well, the latter has been understudied in LMICs (; ), even though older adults (like children) are thought to be more impacted by their local conditions (; ; ). Based largely on work from high-income countries (e.g., United States, Japan), income inequality, absolute and relative deprivation, community socioeconomic status, and public expenditures have all been theorized and tested as community factors that influence individual health on the principle that the socioeconomic status of a community directly shapes the physical and social environment (; ). This existing research typically uses some measure of income or income inequality to capture material resources (; ; ). This literature is largely influenced by , which suggests that relative income or deprivation is more important in explaining health outcomes than absolute income levels ().A neo-material outlook builds on Wilkinson’s general theory but understands that these inequalities originate from the differential accumulation of exposures and experiences from the material world (; ; ). In this context, the question of what types of resources are important for subjective well-being emerges. Recent research suggests that basic community built resources (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity) are still an issue for LMICs; therefore, looking at community built resources provides a way to study the effect of place on a populations’ health and well-being (; ; ). For example,  found that district-level measures of developed infrastructure explained some of the racial difference in child stunting in South Africa, and  found differences in life satisfaction at the province level related to the extent of government funding of public services and infrastructure, such as phone lines.  found that municipal services such as water, electricity, sanitation facilities, and type of housing shape the daily experiences of residents, which in turn contributes to increased sexual health risk behaviors. The present study extends this research and, building on Burns and Snow by including a measure of healthcare quality in the conceptualization of built resources, argues that built resources are “public goods” capable of increasing older adults’ health and well-being (; ). Healthcare and HIV StatusPublic healthcare is the primary source of care for most South Africans (), but the healthcare system is often characterized as dysfunctional and plagued by a legacy of discrimination and underdevelopment (). The postapartheid system has tried to improve access to healthcare by using districts as the administrative unit for distributing health resources at local community health centers (). The distribution of health infrastructure is important because access to basic health services has been shown to have important implications for health and well-being (; ). In the United States, the distribution and quality of primary care within states is significantly associated with health outcomes (; ).Despite these improvements, many older persons in sub-Saharan Africa still lack consistent access to basic healthcare (). This is troubling because their rates of non-communicable diseases and chronic conditions are rising (; ; ; ). The healthcare system and families are also strained by the enduring HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2007, at the time of the study the prevalence of HIV in individual districts ranged from 7 to 40% (). Although older adults in South Africa are infected at lower rates (6.4%; ; ), the high HIV prevalence stresses their family and household systems (). As such, this study argues that districts with higher HIV prevalence will stress the healthcare infrastructure of the district and divert resources away from older persons’ needs. Subjective Well-BeingHealth and subjective well-being are thought to have a reciprocal relationship (; ). Well-being refers to an “individual’s appraisal of his or her life situation as a whole; the totality of pleasures and pains, or quality of life” (), which is broader than a conceptualization of physical health. However, the literature on the influence of community factors has generally ignored subjective well-being outcomes. This is surprising because researchers often assume psychological ill effects to be a major pathway from environment to health (). Also, of the few studies on health, subjective well-being, and community-level factors, none were conducted in LMICs. This is an important gap because South Africa is likely to be different; for example, whereas the relationship between age and well-being is consistently U-shaped in high-income countries, in South Africa well-being changes little with age (). In this study, the theoretical frame for explaining the relationship between health and community context is extended to include subjective well-being, arguing that including both measures provides a more precise description of the health and well-being of older people to inform intervention policy (; ). Place: South African DistrictsThe study also draws on placed-based theories that posit that distribution of public goods have consequences for older persons’ quality of life (; ; ). Although place can refer to tangible and intangible concepts such as location, political unit, or attachment (), place here refers to the service environment of South Africa, which is made up of nine provinces (comparable to U.S. states) divided into 52 districts (comparable to U.S. counties). The Municipal Structure Amendment Act of 2000 allocated infrastructural development to districts, making them the main infrastructural service environment in which older adults live. Research Hypotheses displays the conceptual model. The fundamental premise of the model is that broader dynamic and interactive social, political, and economic processes structure access to societal resources, which are public goods potentially influencing evaluations of subjective well-being and ultimately impacting physical health. In other words, the infrastructure of a district may play a role in how the elderly perceive their lives and opportunities for care, which in turn has an effect on their health, perhaps through the pathway of chronic stressors. Thus, this study investigates the following hypotheses: Figure 1.Conceptual model of community and individual-level characteristics influence on perceived quality of life.Figure 1.Conceptual model of community and individual-level characteristics influence on perceived quality of life.H1: Built resources in a district are positively associated with subjective well-being among older South Africans.H2: More investment in district health services translates into better subjective well-being for older persons.H3: District level factors interact with the presence of a chronic health condition to explain individual level perceived quality of life. MethodsDataThe individual health and sociodemographic information was drawn from the WHO Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) Wave-1. WHO-SAGE is a study of cohorts of persons aged 50 years and older with a comparison sample of younger adults aged 18–49 years, implemented in six LIMCs, including South Africa. WHO-SAGE provides individual data, including sociodemographic characteristics, health status, physical functioning, health examination and biomarkers, well-being and quality of life, and household wealth information (WHO-SAGE instruments and data are publicly available through their project website ()). Data for Wave-1 in South Africa was collected from March 2007 to September 2008. The sample design entailed a two-stage stratified random cluster sample that yielded national and sub-national level estimates, stratified by province, place of residence (urban and rural), and race (). In sampled “older” households, any household member aged 50 years or older was eligible for interview. The individual response rate was 77%. The data weights were created with post-stratified individual probability weights based on the selection probability at each stage of selection, and post-stratified by province, sex, and age according to Statistics South Africa’s 2009 medium mid-year population estimates (). (For more detail on WHO-SAGE survey methods and materials, see  and ).District-level information was drawn from routine District Health Information System data reported in the District Health Barometer (DHB), which was first published in 2004 and annually thereafter. The DHB collects data monthly from primary healthcare facilities and hospitals and has become a central source of health information for South Africa’s Department of Health’s District Health System. This study uses the DHB 2007/2008, which includes additional population and socioeconomic information drawn from Stats SA’s 2007 Community Survey and the 2005 and 2006 General Household Surveys ().Only cases with valid responses were included in the analyses. After deleting missing cases, the resulting sample consists of 2,937 respondents between the ages of 50 and 105 from 42 districts. The average number of observations within a district is 69.9 with a range of 5–276 respondents. VariablesTo measure overall subjective well-being, the eight-item WHO Quality of Life (WHOQoL) scale is used; a shortened version of the WHOQoL Brief found to be a comparable measure (). The WHOQoL instruments contains a set of international, cross-culturally comparable tools used to assess quality of life and provides a measure of the eudemonic component of subjective well-being (; ). The measures have been used widely in cross-national research and have been found to constitute robust indicators (). The scale combines responses to eight questions covering four domains of perceived quality of life: physical, psychological, social, and environmental (). The eight questions ask if the respondent had (a) enough energy for daily life, (b) enough money to meet needs, (c) ability to perform daily activities, and satisfaction with (d) health, (e) self, (f) personal relationships, (g) condition of living space, and (h) overall quality of life. The items were summed and transformed to a scale with a range of 0–100, where a higher score indicates a better quality of life (α = 0.84).To capture differential infrastructure development across districts, three measures of district context are examined, including one measure of the healthcare system. First, built environment index is a composite measure that uses the proportion of the district that has access to four commonly used municipal services: housing, water, sanitation, and electricity. This information was drawn from the South African General Household Survey where individuals reported if they were living in a traditional dwelling (made of clay or other locally available materials), and if their household had piped water, modern sanitation, and electricity. For each case, Z-scores were created for each variable and summed (α = 0.90). In the resulting measure, a higher built environment index value means the district environment had more resources. Second, nurse clinical workload is the average daily number of patients a professional nurse attends to in primary healthcare facilities, which is an accepted indicator of the quality of patient care (). Third, HIV prevalence rate is a measure of the percentage of the district’s adult population in 2007 with HIV. Because the HIV prevalence rate was found to have significant left skew, it was recoded into four dummy variables: districts with rates between 7.3 and 21.3 (first; reference group), between 22.4 and 28.9 (second), between 29.2 and 33.2 (third), and between 33.3 and 41.6 (fourth). At the district level, controls for population density (per km2) and percentage unemployed are included in the regression models.To capture individuals’ physical health, the presence of a chronic health condition or not is examined, which is an accepted measure of morbidity/comorbidity (). With reference to diabetes, stroke, angina, hypertension, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respondents were asked whether they had “ever been told by a health professional that you have” or had “ever been diagnosed with” any of the conditions, where 1 = yes and 0 = no.The analysis also includes controls for individual factors that relate to well-being in this population (; ). Sex was coded with males as 0 (reference group) and females as 1. Race originally assigned individuals to one of four racial categories: African, Colored, Indian, or White. These categories were assigned by the apartheid government and still reflect relative social rankings (; ). Race is recoded into Black African and Others, with Others as the reference group. A dichotomous marital status variable was generated—Married or Not married (i.e., those never married, separated, divorced, or widowed). Education was coded as No formal education, Primary school or less (7 years or less), and Eight plus years (reference group). The households’ socioeconomic status (SES) was an index based on 21 variables including self-reported income, type and size of dwelling, access to water and electricity, appliances and livestock owned, and available transportation. The score was derived through principal component factor analysis that was divided into quintiles () and then grouped into three variables: Low SES, Medium SES, and High SES (reference group). Finally, to account for resident stability or time in the district, the analysis includes Not Moved, a dummy variable coded as 1 if the respondent had not moved districts in the past 2 years. AnalysisAll analyses were conducted using Stata 13 (). Descriptive statistics are presented for district (level 2) and individual (level 1) variables. Random effect linear regression was then used with individuals that are nested within districts to assess the effect of district characteristics while controlling for individual characteristics. An empty model was ran and determined that there was significant variation in perceived quality of life conditions at the district level. Deviance tests or likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the relative fit of models, and , p. 49) criteria for model fit was used; all models presented met this criteria. Interaction terms between chronic health condition and the built resource index, nurse clinical workload, and HIV prevalence were created and tested. Only built resource index was found to have a significant interaction with chronic health condition and is thus shown in the final model. In regression models, percentage African is left out as a control because the linear form was highly collinear with the main independent variable (built resource index). This is consistent with research in the United States that finds racial minority concentration is not a determinant of individual health measure at the county or state level (; ).For the final models presented here, multicollinearity was tested for and found that the variance inflation factor did not exceed 4.24 in any model. Individual (level 1) weights were normalized and all the data presented is weighted. Supplementary analyses were conducted using unweighted data, but results were generally consistent with weighted data. Results and  display the descriptive statistics for the district-level and individual-level information, respectively. The mean population density of the districts was 235.40 with a range of 0.92–2028.25. Built resource index has a mean of 2.81 with a standard deviation of 0.67 (range 0.98–3.75). Nurse clinical workload averages 26.58 patients a day with a range of 14.02–44.16. Of the 42 districts, 26.19% were in the lowest HIV prevalence category, 23.81% in the second highest, 26.19% in the third highest, and 23.81% in the fourth (highest) category. Percentage unemployed ranged among the districts from about 15% to over 50%.  Table 1.Descriptive Statistics for All District-level Variables  Table 2.Weighted Descriptive Statistics for Individual Level Variables Respondents had a mean age of 61.60 (range of 50–105), and the sample was predominantly female (59.83%), married (52.08%), and identified as Black African (74.25%). Forty-seven percent completed primary school and 29.73% completing eight or more years of education, with just 23.26% reporting no formal education. Respondents’ were equally distributed between the socioeconomic status quintiles, roughly 20% in each category. A majority of respondents (67.70%) had never moved districts.On average respondents reported a quality of life score of 60.29 with a standard deviation of 15.71 and a range of 0–100, with a higher score indicating better well-being. The majority of respondents reported having chronic conditions (65.14%). Just over 37% reported having one chronic condition, almost 23.5% reported having two conditions, and less than 4% reported having three or more conditions. The most common reported chronic condition was hypertension followed by diabetes. displays results of multilevel regressions of subjective well-being on district and individual characteristics. The ICC for the null model is 0.077, indicating that 7.7% of the variance in subjective well-being can be attributed to the older adults’ district. Model 1 includes district independent and control variables and shows built resource has a significant positive impact on subjective well-being. On average, a 1% increase in built resource index yields a 0.104-point increase in quality of life score. Mode 1 shows HIV prevalence has a significant negative impact on older adults’ quality of life. Compared to living in a district with the lowest HIV prevalence, those living in the second lowest have an average quality of life score 3.2 points lower, those in the third highest HIV prevalence have an average quality of life score 4.3 points lower. Model 1 further shows that healthcare quality, conceptualized by nurse clinical workload, has no significant effect on older adults’ perceived quality of life.

Results suppressed for brevity.*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 (two-tailed).Model 2 adds individual level (level 1) controls (i.e., chronic health status, age, race, etc.). In general, the individual level controls operate in the expected direction. In Model 2, built resources index remains significant; however, the effect size decreased by over half. HIV prevalence rates do not remain significant. Having a chronic health condition compared to not reporting one decreases a respondent’s quality of life score by 5.493 points. For each of the following, quality of life score also decrease: being Black African compared to Other, being married compared to being in a relationship, and having no formal education or primary school compared to 8 years or more. Compared to being in the lowest household SES, being in each higher quintile increases the respondents’ quality of life. Individual covariates of age, gender, and resident stability are not significant in Model 2. The relationship between perceived quality of life, district infrastructure, and chronic health condition is explored in Model 3.Model 3 shows a significant cross-level interaction between built resource index and chronic health condition. In this model, the coefficient for chronic health condition is negative, the built resource index coefficient is positive, and the cross-level interaction of chronic health condition and district build resource index is positive.  graphs this cross-level interaction and indicates that the positive effect of community built resources is beneficial for everyone, but more so for those without a chronic illness. As the built resource score increases, the gap in well-being narrows between individuals with a chronic health condition and those without. At 1.5 standard deviations below the mean on built resource index, there is an eight-point difference between those with or without a chronic condition, but the gap narrows to 3.5 points at the other end of the spectrum.

All other variables at mean.Together, the results indicate that district built resources has a buffering effect on older adults’ perceived quality of life, moderated by individual health status. A higher built resource index score indicates a more resource-rich and advantaged district, and respondents living in those districts are likely to have higher subjective well-being. DiscussionThis study presents cross-sectional evidence of an association between district-level environment and older persons’ subjective well-being. This is a valuable contribution to the literature as it demonstrates that a place-based theory of subjective well-being is a useful lens for studying “aging well.” This study is the first to investigate the effect of district resource conditions on subjective well-being using data from postapartheid South Africa, and one of only a handful of studies that use multilevel modeling to investigate contextual effects on individual subjective well-being while controlling for individual characteristics ().The results demonstrate that a district’s built resources significantly affect individual subjective well-being, even when controlling for individual characteristics such as physical health, SES, and race. Older adults living in more resource-deprived areas report lower subjective well-being, which is a finding that adds to the growing literature on the influence of service environments on older adults’ outlook on life (; ). This finding is consistent with research on older adult populations emerging from other LMICs such as China, where provincial built services were associated with adults’ well-being (), and India, where community context affected acute and chronic illness of adult men and women (). In the context of the literature, the results of the present study highlight the importance of the distribution of built resources for older persons and fine tunes our understanding of how well-being is affected because it used multilevel models to accurately account for both individual and community characteristics at the same time.The study’s focus on place is important because most of the South African population over age 50 are “aging in place” and thus relying mainly on family and friends in their home and immediate neighborhoods. They also rely on formal support (i.e., social and governmental services) that spans a larger geopolitical area (), in this case the district level because that is the main site of municipal services and health infrastructure. Thus, even though aging in place means interactions take place in a very small area, as people become older and develop more needs, they may become more vulnerable to the larger service environment in which they live and receive health, social, and governmental services (). In this way, district services likely affect subjective well-being more strongly for older persons.The finding that the effect of increased built resources is moderated by the presence of a chronic condition is also important because it adds to our understanding of the interplay between factors that influence health and well-being differently in the same population. Further, the findings on subjective well-being demonstrate its value as a “health” outcome when studying the effect of community area services and resources; this echoes previous work that finds community level effects are stronger for the psychosocial dimension of health than other dimension (; ; ).This work presents insights for policy interventions because it connects subjective well-being to health in the context of basic municipal services, which are a tangible and contested point of policy intervention in South Africa and other LIMCs. First, examining well-being may explain more at the population level than looking at disease alone may explain because well-being may have a protective influence on physical health (). Second, connecting well-being to the lack of access to basic services connects it to society-wide investments that can improve population health. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of protests in South Africa for improved water, electricity, and sanitation service delivery doubled from 8.3% to 16.7% (). Improving the access to basic necessities may not only increase social cohesion and reduce violent events, it may also improve the health and well-being of those who receive better services.This research does have limitations. As the study relied on national probability sample survey data, the number of respondents varies across districts. As such, the results are more influenced by districts with larger sample sizes and need to be interpreted with caution. Also, district characteristics (i.e., built resources, health infrastructure quality) may be endogenous if they are purposively placed in areas with particularly poor health or where there is higher demand. Further, this study did not test for the influence of district public healthcare expenditures or income inequality, which may have an influence on older adults’ perceived quality of life. Finally, the nature of built resource index limits the study’s reproducibility and generalizability to other populations.Looking forward, continued research on older South Africans’ district context and its effect on well-being and health will continue to be important because the incidence of chronic disease is increasing and the HIV epidemic will continue to strain the system. This study highlighted the role of context or “public goods” for subjective well-being and bolstered  initial findings that suggested subjective well-being outcomes are influenced by context. The findings are useful for implementing programs and interventions designed to achieve greater subjective well-being for all. Future research should investigate models that predict chronic health conditions and include controls for utilization and satisfaction with healthcare.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesTo examine prospective associations of perceived attributes of local destinations and routes with middle-to-older aged adults’ 4-year changes in walking for transport (WT) and walking for recreation (WR).Research Design and MethodsData were collected from adults aged 50–64 years old, living in Adelaide, Australia. Participants (N = 454) reported weekly frequency of WT and WR at baseline (2003–2004) and follow-up (2007–2008). Attributes of local destinations and routes were based on self-reported measures at baseline and included: proximity to utilitarian and recreational destinations, the number of such destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, street connectivity, and walking paths. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the associations of perceived destination and route attributes with changes in frequency of WT and WR.ResultsHigher levels of perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations, reporting a larger number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home and higher street connectivity were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WT. Higher levels of perceived proximity to recreational destinations and better walking paths were associated with more positive changes in frequency of WR. No curvilinear relationships were observed and baseline frequency of walking did not moderate the associations.Discussion and ImplicationsProximity of utilitarian and recreational destinations, well-connected streets, and better walking paths can be supportive of long-term participation in walking among middle-to-older aged adults. Environmental and policy initiatives focusing on such destination and route attributes have the potential to support residents’ aging in place. , , , “Aging in place”—to continue living at home in their local community—is a key social agenda for countries with an aging demographic profile (; ). Aging in place not only meets the aspirations of many older adults to stay in their familiar neighborhood environment but can also reduce public expenditure necessary for residential aged care (; ). The ability to walk outdoors, walking mobility, is fundamental to aging in place, as this functional capacity is needed to carry out important activities of daily living, such as accessing local shops and services, engaging in recreational activities, and participating in community and social events. However, walking mobility declines gradually as people age, due in large part to declining muscle strength, illness, pain, and sensory impairment (). Given that age-related declines in walking mobility begin in middle age (), supporting walking mobility is a relevant goal, not only for older adults but also for the middle-aged.Habitual participation in physical activity such as walking can help maintain physical function and independent mobility (; ; ). For instance, a study on older women found that a higher number of pedometer steps was associated with better physical function 14 years later (). Another study reported associations between the level of physical activity during midlife and functional status at older age (). Furthermore, it has been shown that higher levels of walking by older adults are associated with reduced risk of heart disease () and lower mortality (). Although mobility can be maintained or enhanced through exercise programs, such individual-based approaches tend to be small in scale and have short-term effects: long-term and wide-reaching prevention strategies to combat mobility decline are required to help a larger number of community-dwelling older adults to age in place ().The environments where people live are relevant, because they can encourage or discourage residents’ habitual walking and, thus are likely to have a sustained impact on the trajectory of walking mobility at a community level (; ; ). However, as shown in a recent review (), our understanding about environmental attributes supporting older adults’ walking is derived mostly from cross-sectional studies. It has been also shown that environmental attributes related to walking in cross-sectional analyses are not necessarily associated prospectively with maintenance of walking (). Further evidence from longitudinal observations is needed to better understand neighborhood environmental attributes that can assist middle-to-older aged adults to maintain their walking.Neighborhood environments that support routine walking require multiple destinations such as shops and services in close proximity from home and easy-to-walk routes to reach such local destinations (). There are a few longitudinal studies that examined how local destinations are related to changes in older adults’ walking. A study conducted in Canada found the proximity to services and amenities to be conducive to older adults’ walking maintenance over a 3-year period (). Studies in the United States have shown that older adults with convenient access to activity facilities (e.g., parks, walking trails) were less likely to decrease walking (; ). However, little is known about how access to different types of local destinations (for utilitarian and recreational purposes) is related to specific types of walking (for transport and for recreation). For route attributes, street connectivity was found to be associated with maintenance of walking in general adults (). It is possible that such route characteristics may be even more important for older adults due to declining mobility. However, no research seems to have examined specific route attributes prospectively associated with older adults’ walking. In addition, little research seems to have examined how environmental attributes are related to long-term participation in walking among middle-aged adults.Using data from a 4-year prospective observational study, we examined the associations of perceived attributes of local destinations and routes with middle-to-older aged adults’ changes in walking for transport and for recreation. MethodsData Source and Study SettingData from the Physical Activity in Localities and Community (PLACE) study conducted in Adelaide (population: 1.1 million), the state capital city of South Australia, were used. The original aim of the PLACE study was to examine the associations between built environment attributes, in particular neighborhood walkability, and adult physical activity. Detailed methods of the study have been reported elsewhere (). Briefly, residential addresses were selected from 154 Census Collection Districts (CCD, a geographical unit comprising of about 250 households) within Adelaide. These CCDs were randomly chosen from the top and bottom quartiles in neighborhood walkability, in order to maximize the variability in environmental attributes that may be related to physical activity. Walkability is a composite index consisting of residential density, intersection density, land use mix, and net retail area ratio, which were derived using Geographic Information Systems (). The selected CCDs had a mean area of 31.5 ha (median: 23 ha, range: 5.2–251.8 ha).Baseline data were collected from 2,650 adults aged between 20 and 64 years in 2003–2004. The baseline response rate, as a proportion of all the households initially identified, was 11.5%. Follow-up data collection was conducted in 2007–2008, approximately 4 years after baseline. The number of participants for follow-up was 1,036. Of these, this study focused on middle-to-older aged adults who were over 50 years old at baseline (N = 470). The Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland approved the study. All participants provided informed consent prior to being enrolled in the study. Outcomes: Changes in Weekly Frequency of Walking for Transport and for RecreationThe outcome measures of the study were changes in weekly frequency of walking for transport (WT) and of walking for recreation (WR) over 4 years. They were derived from self-reported frequency of WT and WR, which is part of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form (). Participants were asked both at baseline and follow-up on how many days during the last 7 days they walked to go from place to place (WT) or in their leisure time (WR). Four-year changes in frequency of WT and of WR were operationalized by subtracting the baseline frequency from the corresponding follow-up frequency so that a positive value indicated an increase in frequency of walking across time. Exposures: Attributes of Local Destinations and RoutesLocal DestinationsWalking distance to local destinations at baseline was assessed using a scale in the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS-AU) (). The scale asked participants to report walking distance to the nearest business or facility for 13 utilitarian destinations (local shop, supermarket, hardware store, greengrocer, dry cleaner, post office; library, book shop, café/restaurant, video outlet, pharmacy, professional office, and appliance store) and 6 recreational destinations (park, bushland, fitness club, sports field, beach, and river). Participants responded to each item by choosing from the following options: 1 (within 5 min), 2 (6–10 min), 3 (11–20 min), 4 (21–30 min), 5 (over 31 min), and 6 (“do not know”). Composite measures of proximity to utilitarian and recreational destinations were calculated using the NEWS scoring protocol: proximity was computed as the mean responses on the respective reverse-coded items: 1 (over 31 min or “do not know”), 2 (21–30 min), 3 (11–20 min), 4 (6–10 min), 5 (within 5 min) (). We also counted the number of utilitarian and recreational destination types that were within 10 min walk from home (corresponding to reversed scores of 4 to 5) and 11–20 min walk from home (corresponding to reversed score of 3). There were four separate count variables for destinations (two destination types by two distance categories). RoutesTwo route-related measures, street connectivity and walking paths, were created based on participants’ responses to items in the NEWS-AU (). Participants were asked to evaluate their local area by responding to statements concerning route-related attributes. The format of response options was a scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 4 (“strongly agree”). These two attributes were included in this study because of their relatively consistent associations with walking (; ; ). Street connectivity was represented as the mean response to the following four items: local area not having many cul-de-sacs, short distance between intersections, many four-way intersections, and many alternative routes. For walking paths, the mean response to the following three items was used: footpaths on most of the streets, footpaths well-maintained, and having bicycle or walking paths nearby. CovariatesThe following self-reported sociodemographic variables were collected in the study: age, gender, education, work status (at baseline, at follow-up), marital status, having child in the household, and income categories. Educational attainment was categorized into tertiary (university or vocational education) and lower (up to high school). Data AnalysisGeneralized additive mixed models (GAMMs), accounting for clustering at the CCD level and possible curvilinear relationships (), were used to examine the associations of perceived proximity to destinations, the number of destinations, street connectivity, and walking paths with changes in frequency of WT and WR. GAMMs are versatile regression models appropriate for spatially and temporally correlated data. They can accommodate outcomes following various distributional assumptions (e.g., normal, binomial, Gamma or negative binomial) and model complex curvilinear relationships of unknown shape ().For each walking outcome, we estimated six “single-environmental-characteristic” main-effect GAMMs with the following environmental variables: (a) proximity to utilitarian destinations, (b) number of utilitarian destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, (c) proximity to recreational destinations, (d) number of recreational destinations within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home, (e) street connectivity, and (f) walking paths. We also estimated fully-adjusted models for each walking outcome, in which the associations of each type of the destination variables—proximity or count (within 10 and 11–20 min walk from home)—were examined conjointly with two route attributes. Finally, we examined whether the above associations were moderated by baseline frequency of WT or WR, as appropriate. All models adjusted for sociodemographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, income, and work status at follow-up), which were associated with either of the outcome variables in bivariate analyses (p < .1). Models accounted for clustering at the CCD level. Analyses were conducted using R (). Statistical significance was set at p less than .05. ResultsAfter excluding those with missing values for the walking frequency and destination items (n = 16), 454 participants remained in the sample.  shows the characteristics of the sample. The mean frequency of walking was 3.3 days/week for WT and 2.6 days/week for WR at baseline. On average, a slight decrease in frequency of WT and WR was observed at follow-up. Table 1.Sample Characteristics (n = 454) Note: Proximity to destination score: 1 (over 31 min or “do not know”), 2 (21–30 min), 3 (11–20 min), 4 (6–10 min), and 5 (within 5 min). Environmental Attributes Associated With Changes in WT Frequency shows the regression coefficients (95% CI) of perceived proximity to destinations, number of destinations within a certain distance from home, and route attributes in relation to changes in frequency of WT and WR. Positive coefficients (for instance, 0.5) indicate that a one-unit increment in the exposure measure is associated with an increase (0.5 times/week) in walking frequency from baseline to follow-up. Higher levels of perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations from home, a larger number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home, and more connected local streets were associated with more positive changes in weekly frequency of WT. The effects of proximity to utilitarian destinations and number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk remained statistically significant in the fully-adjusted models. The regression coefficient for street connectivity was attenuated in the fully-adjusted model. No significant associations with changes in WT were found for perceived proximity to recreational destinations, number of recreational destinations, and walking paths. No curvilinear relationships were observed for the associations of environmental attributes with changes in WT frequency. Baseline frequency of WT did not moderate the above associations. Table 2.Regression Coefficients (95% CI) of Changes in Weekly Frequency of WT and WR According to Attributes of Utilitarian and Recreational Destinations and Routes Note: All models adjusted for age, gender, education, household income, work status at follow-up and corrected for clustering at the Census Collection Districts level.

Panel A shows, in the fully-adjusted model, that participants reporting an average score ≥ 3.4 (corresponding to a distance within 6–20 min walk from home) in proximity to utilitarian destinations maintained or even increased their frequency of WT from baseline to follow-up, while participants reporting greater perceived distances to utilitarian destinations tended to engage in WT less frequently than they did at baseline. Panel B shows that participants reporting on average 6.6 utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home maintained or even increased their frequency of WT from baseline to follow-up, while participants reporting fewer destinations tended to decrease WT frequently at follow-up. Panel C shows that, in the single-environmental-characteristic model, participants reporting an average score ≥ 2.9 (corresponding to a rating of “somewhat agree” with the statements included in the scale) in street connectivity tended to maintain or increase their frequency of WT from baseline to follow-up, while participants reporting poorer street connectivity tended to decrease WT frequency at follow-up.

Dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals of the regression lines (oblique lines). The vertical lines intersecting the regression lines indicate the values of the perceived environmental variables below and above which participants respectively decreased or increased their weekly frequency of WT over time. Environmental Attributes Associated With Changes in WR Frequency shows that higher levels of perceived proximity to recreational destinations from home and better walking paths were associated with more positive changes in weekly frequency of WR. A marginal positive association was also observed between the number of recreational destinations within 11–20 min walk from home and changes in WR frequency (p = .058). The regression coefficient for proximity to recreational destinations was attenuated in the fully-adjusted model but that for walking paths remained statistically significant. No significant associations with changes in WR frequency were found for perceived proximity to utilitarian destinations, number of utilitarian destinations, and street connectivity. No curvilinear relationships were observed for the associations of environmental attributes with changes in WR. Baseline frequency of WR did not moderate the above associations.Panel A of  shows the relationships between perceived proximity to recreational destinations and changes in frequency of WR, derived from the single-environmental-characteristic model. It was estimated that participants reporting an average score ≥ 3.8 (approximately corresponding to a distance within 6–10 min walk from home) maintained or increased their frequency of WR from baseline to follow-up, while those reporting poorer access to recreational destinations tended to decrease WR frequency at follow-up. Panel B shows the fully-adjusted (adjusted for proximity to destinations) relationship of walking paths with changes in frequency of WR. Participants reporting an average score ≥ 3.6 (corresponding to a rating between “somewhat agree” and “strongly agree” with the statements included in the scale) in walking paths tended to maintain or increase their frequency of WR from baseline to follow-up, while those reporting lower levels of walking paths tended to decrease WR frequency at follow-up.

DiscussionThis study found that several perceived attributes of local destinations and routes were related to 4-year changes in the walking frequency of middle-to-older aged adults in Australia. Destination attributes that may help them maintain or increase walking for transport (WT) was proximity to utilitarian destinations and the number of utilitarian destinations within 10 min walks from home. These findings are consistent with the study by  and suggest that presence of local shops and services nearby may contribute to middle-to-older aged residents’ walking maintenance over time. Better street connectivity is also likely to facilitate middle-to-older aged adults’ maintenance of WT. It has been shown that areas with high street connectivity tend to have more local retail destinations () and this is a potential reason for the attenuated association in the fully-adjusted model where the destination variables were included. These findings suggest that compact neighborhoods with more local shops and services and with well-connected streets (e.g., grid-type street pattern, small block size, few cul-de-sacs) may support residents’ aging in place by preventing decline in active travel, whereas living in neighborhoods with less destinations and poorly-connected streets may increase the risk of mobility decline over time, as residents of such areas tend to reduce their frequency of WT.Proximity to recreational destinations and the presence and quality of walking paths (e.g., footpaths, walking trails) were found to be related to changes in frequency of walking for recreation (WR). The presence of recreational destinations within 11–20 min walking distance from home was also marginally associated with this walking outcome. Access to recreational facilities was found to be conducive to maintenance of walking in previous studies (; ). Our findings support these previous studies by showing that the presence of recreational destinations such as parks, sport fields, and rivers can help middle-to-older aged adults keep walking during leisure time. However, the weaker association for recreational destinations found (in comparison to the associations of utilitarian destinations with WT) may be a reflection of the importance of quality of recreational destinations, which was not measured in this study. There is evidence suggesting the importance of having a high quality park with many amenities and facilities (as opposed to having multiple low-quality parks) in attracting more park visitors (). Other potentially relevant attributes of recreational destinations include programs, safety, and cost (; ). The regression coefficients and the level of significance in the fully-adjusted models for walking paths appear to indicate that better walking paths may be more relevant to maintenance of WR than recreational destinations. A natural experiment has shown that improving access to a walking trail increased the neighborhood-level physical activity (). An Australian study found that access to parks was significantly associated with recreational walking only among participants without access to walking trails, which suggests that access to parks may not contribute to recreational walking for adults having walking trails nearby (). These studies support the importance of high quality walking paths (e.g., walking trails separate from motor vehicles) for recreational walking. Providing a network of walking paths/trails may encourage habitual participation in recreational walking among middle-to-older aged adults.This study examined possible distance thresholds for utilitarian and recreational destinations within which maintenance of walking may be facilitated. Participants having more utilitarian destinations within 10 min walk from home were more likely to maintain/increase the frequency of WT, while those having more recreational destinations within 11–20 min walk from home were more likely to maintain/increase the frequency of WR (the association was marginally significant). The findings appear to be plausible, considering that WR tends to be longer in duration compared to WT (). However, the results of the proximity measures ( and ) suggest otherwise: the distance threshold within which walking maintenance may be facilitated seems shorter for WR than for WT. Better understanding of how far people would walk to get to various types of destinations is important for urban designers and planners to make informed decisions with regard to the size of neighborhoods and distribution of land uses for various purposes (). This study did not produce clear findings about the distance to recreational destinations that would support long-term participation in recreational walking. Identifying the distances that would be more likely to encourage habitual walking among residents would be useful for planners to design or retrofit neighborhoods conducive to active living. Further research using objectively-measured distance to local destinations is needed to identify the distance threshold.We did not observe curvilinear associations, suggesting that any additional local destinations or improvement in route characteristics is likely to have a positive impact on middle-to-older aged residents’ long-term participation in walking. It was also found that the baseline frequency of walking did not moderate the associations observed. This suggests that having more local destinations and better route characteristics may assist walking maintenance regardless of the level of walking at baseline. It should be noted that no change in walking frequency, which was regarded as maintenance, included those who did not walk both at baseline and at follow-up. The findings can be interpreted as showing that more local destinations and better route characteristics may help them initiate walking. There are conceptual and methodological challenges in examining behavioral maintenance. Future research needs to include more than two assessments across time (three or more time points) to provide further insights into correlates of walking maintenance.This study identified several environmental attributes that may be modified to promote middle-to-older adults’ long-term participation in walking. Focusing on the effect size, it is possible to argue that increasing utilitarian destinations and enhancing walking paths may be effective environmental interventions to encourage them to maintain walking. However, it is important to recognize that some environmental attributes are easier to modify than others. Although having more utilitarian destinations nearby can contribute to maintenance of walking for transport, it would not be easy to add shops and services in existing neighborhoods. In contrast, improving the quality of walking paths, which can be done by a local government, would be relatively easy to implement (). Thus, for existing neighborhoods, improving and building walking paths is likely to be a practical strategy to help residents continue their walking. For newly-developed neighborhoods, spatial and land use planning needs to take into account access to destinations (availability and distance), street network, and walking paths to encourage residents’ habitual walking for transport and for recreation.Some middle-to-older adults relocate after retirement or after their children leave home. According to an Australia report, 28% of adults aged 55–64 years and 25% of adults aged 65 years and older relocate to downsize their residence (). This relocation is relevant to the subsequent trajectory of mobility decline: moving to areas that do not support walking could result in an early onset of mobility decline. Our findings can inform local governments, developers, and advocates in identifying areas where middle-to-older aged adults are more likely to reduce their walking. For instance, living in retirement villages built in car dependent areas (poor in access to local destinations and in route characteristics) may accelerate residents’ mobility decline over time due to reduced walking. More specific evidence is needed to assist the development of guidelines with regard to suitable locations where residents can maintain walking and age in place.The strengths of this study include its longitudinal design and the use of specific types of walking and destinations. Limitations include the possible sample selection bias due to the low response and high attrition rates. The outcome was derived from the self-reported frequency (days/week) of walking, which is relatively easy to recall but may not reflect the duration of walking. The use of self-report measures for environmental attributes is another limitation. The measure of local destinations was based on the perceived distance to the closest destination for each of 19 different destination types, which may not necessarily reflect the total number of destinations within the local area. Further research using objectively-measured number of and distance to local destinations is needed to confirm our findings. In light of the potential importance of walking paths in existing neighborhoods, more robust evidence using objectively-derived route attributes would help convince policy makers and practitioners to improve and build footpaths and walking trails to facilitate long-term participation in walking. ConclusionGiven a rapid population aging in many developed countries, supporting the mobility of older adults to help them maintain independence is an urgent issue. An increase in the number of older adults with impaired walking mobility and requiring residential care would further increase public expenditure in aged-care sectors. This study suggests that environmental initiatives focusing on local destinations and routes have a potential to mitigate this concern. Further evidence on environmental factors conducive to maintenance of walking needs to be generated and synthesized in order to inform relevant stakeholders.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesEmpirical research indicates that engagement with public space decreases with age. Why do some older adults withdraw from the public, and which role does the (urban) environment play in spatial (dis-)engagement? Environmental gerontology’s model of person–environment (PE) fit suggests an interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity and wellbeing in later life. However, there is little research on how these dimensions are actually related. This study sets out to investigate this relationship and how PE can be better adapted for deprived neighborhoods.Research Design and MethodsThe study follows a qualitative case studies approach, focusing on a deprived neighborhood in Vienna, Austria. Nonparticipant observations were conducted at this site and complemented by 13 episodic interviews with older residents.ResultsThe results challenge PE’s model of interrelation between agency and belonging and their causal effects on identity, wellbeing, and autonomy in later life. Spatial agency in the deprived neighborhood was intense but so was spatial alienation and distancing oneself from one’s neighborhood. Drawing on notions of territorial stigma, this might be a coping strategy to prevent one’s self-identity from being “stained”. Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space.Discussion and ImplicationsPE can be complemented with intersubjective measures of environmental conditions (e.g., stigma) and spatial engagement. Gerontology should proceed to consider not only the poor, disadvantaged, disengaged elderly, but also the rebellious, resisting, provocative new generation of older adults. , , , , , Research indicates that older adults, on the whole, prefer to “age in place” (), id est (i.e.,) remain living independently in the community, rather than in residential care (). However, even those aging in place seem to withdraw from their environments. Empirical research indicates that time spent in public space decreases with age (; ). But why do some older adults withdraw from public space and which role does the (urban) environment play in spatial (dis-)engagement?In the first part of the article, this question is approached by critically reviewing existing theoretical frameworks of environmental gerontology, focusing on the person–environment (PE) fit, as well as research on sociospatial inequalities from gerontology and urban sociology. In the second part, the suitability of PE fit for deprived neighborhoods is examined with a case study on a disadvantaged residential area in Vienna, Austria. The third part proposes the person–environment–engagement model (PEEM) as a further developed version of PE fit. Complemented with intersubjective measures of environmental conditions and observable environmental engagement, this model is better able to analyze the production and reproduction of sociospatial inequalities in today’s cities. Environmental Gerontology and the Relationship Between Agency and BelongingEnvironmental gerontology addresses the relationship between age and the environmental context that a person ages in (cf. ; ). One of the most influential recent models is the person–environment (PE) fit developed by . PE describes the relationship between place belonging on the one hand and spatial agency, on the other hand, with identity, autonomy, and wellbeing as outcomes of each (). By framing aging as an environmental process in the sense that it is shaped by the mutual interaction between a person or group and its environment(s), they emphasize the role of the physical environment, acknowledging the entanglement of physical, social, organizational, and cultural aspects of environments. The decrease of agency is mediated through the decline or maintenance of individual competence and autonomy on the one hand and the societal opportunity structure on the other. Both sociophysical belonging and sociophysical agency, in turn, affect the quality of later life. From a life-course perspective, belonging and agency diverge across the life course, with the feeling of belonging increasing but sociophysical agency declining (). Figure 1.Person–environment fit. Own representation. Source: .Figure 1.Person–environment fit. Own representation. Source: .In contrast to early environmental gerontologists, PE emphasizes the significance of subjectivity and personal meaning of an environment for a person (or group) and the role of personal agency to intervene and act on one’s environments. On the one hand, PE responds with this to the criticism against the  environmental docility hypothesis, which framed older adults more as “victims” of their environments, and “empowers” them by emphasizing their agency; on the other hand, it reacts to the postpositivist critique of most environmental gerontologist models of being overly functional and lacking relativism by giving the individual, subjective feeling of attachment equal importance. PE’s novelty in comparison to other models is thus its consideration of both objective conditions and environmental needs ().Despite both dimensions—agency and belonging—being equally important in PE, most research in environmental gerontology focuses either on one or on the other. One of the earlier exceptions is , who framed the establishment of a satisfactory physical living arrangement as one of six central developmental tasks in late maturity, considering both the coping strategies and subjective valuation of the result. Adding the dimension of time,  conceptualize a life course model of environmental experience. In their experiential phenomenological research, they analyze the dynamic nature and the development of the person–environment relationship across the life course and how the development of this relationship entails the formation of new competencies. One of the core competencies for building relationships with places is the ability to “make places” that evolves and changes across the life span (). Whereas Rowles and Watkins see a positive assessment of one’s living environment as an outcome of successful place-making practices,  frames appraisal processes as influencing factors for coping strategies in his model of residential normalcy. Assimilative cognitive coping, as mentally and emotionally adjusting to places, can thus not be separated from assimilative action coping, as physically and activity-oriented adjust to places. However, how the relationship between agency and belonging indeed works to affect wellbeing and identity-building in later life, yet tends to be overlooked. Agency and Belonging in Deprived NeighborhoodsBoth spatial agency and place attachment entail questions about social inequalities and social exclusion (). Accordingly, withdrawal from public space can be assumed to affect different groups of older adults to a different extent. Social inequalities are particularly being spatialized in present-day cities (). Disadvantaged populations tend to live in disadvantaged areas, leading to sociospatial segregation, replacement, and even expulsions (). Sociospatial segregation defines all the processes that eventually lead to internally homogenous spaces, which can be based on different social criteria such as socioeconomic status or ethnicity ().Some environmental gerontologists have, hence, turned to the question of neighborhood exclusion as one dimension of social exclusion in older age (for a scoping review on this topic, see ). Ethnographic and qualitative studies in particular have adopted a neighborhood approach based upon understanding of social inequalities, thus choosing case sites based on their level of deprivation (e.g., Day, 2010; ). Such studies may either follow the Anglo-Saxon tradition with a focus on structural exclusion mechanisms (e.g., real estate prices in gentrification processes) or the French tradition, focusing instead on sociocultural exclusion processes.Whereas the former addresses explicit forms of material deprivation or even displacement, the latter refers to subtler ways of sociospatial suppression with symbolic means, as  describe in their “ecological contamination hypothesis.” It implies that the “stigma” as sociocultural “image” of a neighborhood can stain individual identities. Residents are identified with their area by themselves and others, resulting in “postcode anxiety.” Similarly,  elaborate on an analytic framework termed “territorial stigmatization” that combines  concept of “spoiled identity” with Bourdieu’s theory of “symbolic power,” constituting “advanced marginality” in the dualizing metropolis. The territorial stigmatization framework aims to describe how “spatial taint” affects its residents and how they cope with it. What is particularly interesting in Wacquant’s account is, however, that he tries to link stigma not only with segregation but also with the coping mechanisms of those living in the segregated areas, working out differentiating social and symbolic strategies used by the residents of disparaged neighborhoods. He differentiates between strategies that submit to and reproduce, or rebel against spatial stigma (). Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space, therefore varying with characteristics such as class, age, housing tenure, and ethnicity (). Table 1.Coping Strategies With Territorial Stigma Source: Wacquant et al., 2014. found that residents of a public housing estate in Porto, Portugal, reacted to the stigma of their living environment by restricting their public relationships and limiting outdoor activities to subsistence activities, calling this strategy “subsistence sociability” and “focused avoidance.” Thus, territorial stigmatization should not be seen as a condition but rather a form of “action through collective representation fastened on place” (: 1278), thereby advancing empirical understanding of its role in producing urban inequality and marginality.To summarize, most current environmental gerontology and urban sociology assumes a positive relationship between place attachment and place appropriation (independent of the underlying causality). They would assume that high engagement with public space correlates to a strong sense of belonging to the residential environment. The higher both of these are, the greater the sense of autonomy and wellbeing, as well as the more positive the late-life identity. This article investigates how these two dimensions are related in sociospatially deprived neighborhoods. Design and MethodsResearch Questions and MethodsThe study is concerned with the question of why some older adults engage with and some withdraw from public space, assuming that place attachment and spatial agency are critical in facilitating spatial disengagement. More specifically, two questions are being addressed:How are place attachment and spatial agency mutually related among older residents living in deprived neighborhoods?How do place attachment and spatial agency influence late-life identities in deprived neighborhoods?Referring to the conceptual and empirical literature, different hypotheses can be followed to answer these questions. First, all three characteristics—attachment, agency, and identities—could be assumed to be positively related. Hence, a person that feels very much “at home” in their neighborhood and appropriates it extensively would also be more likely to maintain a positive self-identity as an older person. Second, spatial agency is arguably outweighed by place attachment in later life. Hence, a person that feels “at home” in their neighborhood would be more likely to maintain a positive identity despite withdrawing from their neighborhood. Third, older adults are less likely to feel attached to deprived neighborhoods, resulting in “stained identities” in later life and spatial disengagement.To approach these questions, a qualitative case–study approach was chosen. Qualitative methods are better suited to grasp complex processes, such as the evolving relationship between place attachment and spatial agency, and to investigate hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups, like those living in deprived residential areas. Distinctive features of case studies are that the cases have (in this case: spatial) boundaries and a holistic approach is taken to provide an in-depth picture of the cases ().Within the selected cases, Methods of nonparticipation observation to analyze spatial agency and place appropriation were triangulated with results of episodic interviews that give room to elaborations on feelings of belonging to one’s neighborhood and how they changed. Observations, whether participant or nonparticipant, are particularly suited for practice-based approaches, because social practices are always sited and thus public social phenomena ().Episodic interviews () combine narrative passages (e.g., about daily routine) with discursive elements of meaning, symbols, and imaginaries. Anything mentioned in the narrative passages can be made the subject of in-depth inquiries of sense-making. Consequently, everyday spatial practices—like going for a walk, shopping, or meeting friends—can be taken as an entry point for a narration on practices while concurrently leading to the meanings and imaginaries attached to these practices. Interviews were partly conducted with frequent visitors of the observation sites, and partly with “newcomers.” Interviews were completely transcribed and analyzed in a two-stage process, first using thematic coding () and then selecting interview passages to analyze with objective hermeneutics (). Sampling Process and Sample DescriptionSampling was conducted on two levels: First, two case sites in Vienna were selected for case studies and second, individuals for episodic interviews were sampled at these case sites following a theory-led sampling process.Case sites were to be contrasting in regards to sociospatial deprivation—namely privilege—with sampling criteria comprising social structure (mean and median income, education, unemployment rate), historic development of the social structure (“blue collar districts”), population density, percentage of older people, age-dependency ratio, building density, percentage of green spaces and the ratio of built to free spaces, and “district image.” As this article focuses on deprived neighborhoods, only results based upon data from the deprived case site are used.The deprived case site in Vienna’s 5th district, Margareten, is an inner-city area located between the first and the second “belt” road of the city. It is a relatively small and densely populated district, with a high percentage of its limited space dedicated to transportation and buildings instead of green or free spaces. The social structure of its inhabitants can be characterized as younger, more likely to have a migrant background, and to be socioeconomically (income, education, employment) more disadvantaged than Vienna’s average. The developments of the sociospatial conditions that its inhabitants face today are historically grounded. The district is traditionally a worker’s bastion, with heavy industrialization having been enforced, leading to a rapid population growth (doubling of the population) in the midst of the 19th century. The increasing need for accommodation posed major social problems and large public housing initiatives were initiated by the Austrian Social Democratic Party, for which the district has been a stronghold since. To observe how people “do” age in different environments, specific places must be selected within the case site districts, and those places should be as comparable as possible at the privileged and deprived case sites. Structured inspections in which certain criteria (Criteria comprised the embedding in the city’s infrastructure according to WHO’s age-friendly cities criteria () – like barrier-free walkways, public transport, shopping infrastructure or spaces for social activities – as well as the specific design of the places, both featuring a rondo and benches to sit in circles, which is typical of Vienna’s public space architecture.) were documented and compared offered a way to select those places (Lower Kutschkermarkt in Waehring and Bacherpark in Margareten). The observation place at the deprived case site, Bacherpark, is a small inner-city park located next to an elementary school and within a network of traffic-calmed roads. The place itself features a rondo with benches, two sports cages, a playground, and a dog zone. This rondo became the observation site.Nonparticipant observations were conducted at both case sites for 8 months between June 2012 and September 2013. Observation cycles were restricted by weather and limited to warmer periods, namely the months of June, July, August, and September 2012 and 2013. Throughout these 8 months, observations were conducted three times per week for 3–4 hr per observation session, alternating weekdays and time periods to include weekends and weekdays as well as morning, noons, afternoons, and evenings. Throughout the observations, observation protocols were written that comprised times and descriptions of activities as well as sketches of the sociospatial arrangement and movements. At the end of each observation day, observers also wrote postobservation memos, containing any other information, thoughts, or feelings they had had.Theory-led sampling of interview partners took place throughout the observation sessions. Selection was mainly based on age appearance, hence the interviewers judged from the persons’ looks if they seemed old enough to be retired (As the age range described below shows, however, this judgement has not always been quite accurate.). Interviews were partly conducted with frequent visitors that had been observed for a while and partly with persons the interviewers had seen for the first time.Altogether, 13 useable episodic interviews with adults aged 53–91 years were conducted at both case sites; four at the deprived site and nine at the privileged site. The unequal distribution of interviews at both case site results from difficulties that the interviewers faced at the deprived case site, when trying to conduct interviews (Difficulties ranged from refusal to be interviewed to physical threat, which might be attributable to the case site’s deprivation. For this reason, and as violent or threatening behaviour was particularly targeted at the female interviewer/observer, all interviews were finally conducted by the male interviewers/observers.). Three interview partners from the disadvantaged case site were male, one female, whereas the gender ratio was the other way around in the privileged case area (two male, seven female). From the four adults from the disadvantaged site, three were in third age (53, 65, and 71 years old), one in fourth age (80 years old). From the nine interview partners from the privileged area, four were in third age (58, 68, 69, and 72 years), and five in fourth age (78, 88, and two times 91 years). Two of the women had been vendors, one had finished an agricultural school, one an electrician, one a stenographer, one head of a bank department, and two had studied journalism (but only one finished, whereas the other one quit and started to work as a stenographer). Of the men, one had been a patent agent, two had been mechanics, one a computer engineer, and one was a one long-distance lorry driver by profession but currently unemployed and not yet retired.Interviews and observations were conducted by three sociologists (including the author) between the age of 25 and 32 years, of which one was female and two were male. All interviewers were of Austrian origin. Hence, all interviews were conducted in German and interview passages have been translated to English. ResultsResults are structured by addressing the following questions:Who uses the place and how do older adults use it?How do older adults feel about their neighborhood and themselves within it? Who Uses the Place and How Do Older Adults Use It?Bacherpark, the small inner-city space in the deprived neighborhood, was used by diverse groups—mothers and children at the playground, teenagers in the sports cages, and middle-aged and older men at the rondo. Judging from the languages they spoke, most visitors appeared to have a migrant background. User density was high and people would sit and move in immediate proximities, not avoiding bodily contact. Most of the older adults observed stayed for at least half an hour, but duration could stretch to several hours. Consequently, many arrived with a backpack or large bags, carrying beer cans, water bottles, cigarettes, newspapers, and other belongings that helped them spend their time. The physique and bodies of the persons who visited the place had quite a presence, and their attire added to the immediacy of this materiality, as older adults dressed to reveal some skin—wearing short trousers, sandals, tank tops, and brightly colored dresses.Beyond the general and ever-changing visitors, the place hosted a group of frequent visitors that would spend most of their days at the site, thus shaping and “ruling” it with their presence. They would stay particularly long and often left and returned a several times per day. For example, a group of men would sit, drink and smoke on one of the bench-and-table sets close to the playground; after a while, two would get up and leave and one would lay down on a bench and sleep. Other men would pass by, wait for him to wake up, and start playing cards together; then the men from earlier would return.The group consisted of about 10 men and 1 woman from their fifties to their seventies but it also maintained a large social network that stretched beyond the immediate surrounding. The group would enlarge especially over chess games, where up to 20 people gathered around the table, trying to get a view. The one woman that was part of the core group—a studied actress, former alcoholic, and wife to one of the group members—had taken the role of the “chaperone”: she would tell the men not to burp loudly, or to throw their beer cans away (instead of squeezing them between the wooden beams of the table), and would always thank them once they had followed her instructions, which many men—except for her husband—did remorsefully as soon as she complained. She would often sit on a bench a little behind the group, watching them but not taking part in their discussions, because her husband didn’t want her to[…] Mine [A.N.: husband] is a little more calm when he’s chatting with his friends, well, and I do back away, I know he likes that, when you are not – I just watch them, sometimes he indicates to me – card, payback card out means: [go] down, then I go there […] and as I said, one goes down again to the supermarket to get a round, and then they drink […] (female, 71 years)Like this group, the majority of older visitors lived in the immediate environment, 5–15 min away from the park, and they also gave the short distance as the main reason why they had come to that particular place. Their routines seemed, thus, to be more shaped by possibility than by preference. Despite most of them being either retired or unemployed, as they stated in the interviews, they followed a relatively strict daily routine. The common daily routine would be to get up quite early (around 7 A.M. or earlier), have breakfast, do housework (particularly the women), and then go “out” to the “park.” They would return home for lunch and maybe a nap and return home late at night. The continuous repetition of those daily routines bothered some of my interview partners. One man even said his routine would bother him so much that he’d rather be dead than alive.And as I told you, have the same routine every day, the same soul-destroying things every day. You turn on the radio, same shit every day […] television, same shit. What can I do but go somewhere where it’s quiet and nothing more […] Pointless, if you gave me a 9mm, I would end it. (male, 53 years)Yet, public space in the deprived neighborhood did offer a range of opportunities for social interaction. Public space, in general, is a space in which social interactions with strangers—whether perceived as “anonymous, superficial and transitory” (: 1) or as “res publica”, as the network of relations between people that are not part of one community ()—take place. Hence, older visitors who came there on their own would meet acquaintances passing by, who then stopped and chatted for a while. Often, such chats resulted in the passerby sitting down with the other person, and then spending the afternoon together and communicating vividly. Accordingly, the soundscape at Bacherpark was quite intense: People would talk loudly and even shout across the park to another person, or they made frequent and loud use of their cell phones.However, the imaginary of public space as a space of encounter was generally declined by the older adults interviewed. Many emphasized that they would prefer not to talk to anyone when they went outside, despite being aware that they did not act accordingly.No, I don’t want that at all [A.N: to be talked to in public space] – I might even, how shall I say, well I might say, whatever, “Come on, get lost, over there”s a place’ […] Because there are 100 benches that are free and I could have told you I want to have my quiet, but yes. (male, 53 years)Beyond social interaction, most time was spent at Bacherpark doing—apparently—“nothing.” At times, older adults would simply sit down somewhere and stare.  describes this behavior as “situational withdrawal”—a doing that is, he claims, only to a limited extent permitted in public space, as the rules of public space behavior comprise “purposefully going about one’s business” (ibid: 58). While in public space, people must usually demonstrate alertness or use “involvement shields”—like cell phones or newspapers—to legitimately withdraw from this alertness. While social interaction draws upon one aspect of involvement competencies, situational withdrawal draws upon another. Often at Bacherpark, more interactional phases alternated and blended with more withdrawn stages. For example, conversations—often dragging and stiff—between two or more older men would be interrupted by long pauses. In these pauses, they stared around the park and did “nothing” as well. The breaks in conversation were usually filled with smoking and drinking.To summarize, the spatial agency of older adults at Bacherpark was loud, physical, and colorful; it featured many social encounters and hours-long social interactions that alternated with phases of situational withdrawal, drinking, and smoking. Spatial agency at the deprived neighborhood can, hence, be described as vivid, engaged and pronounced. But does this imply that older adults feel as engaged to their neighborhood as they act? How Do Older Adults Feel About Their Neighborhood and Themselves Within it?Despite vivid engagement at the observation site, the older adults interviewed at Bacherpark heavily criticized their neighborhood. Main points for criticism were the other inhabitants and the noise they produced.Whenever we want to have our peace, around 1 PM, they let the children out into the yard – when the weather is nice, of course – but it’s just that time when you leave your windows open […] They, they, of course the kids whine […] we have nothing against that, but I, I don’t like it. (female, 71 years)The search for silence went as far as when asked about the place they would most enjoy going to, one respondent named a close-by cemetery:Quiet, that’s what inspires me, just plain quiet. […] [Author’s Note: At the cemetery] there is the quiet, not like in this park where you cannot even sit down, well I have lived there in the district for years, when you come here, I don’t know the time right now, but everything is crowded. All of this is somehow registered, here are the Polaks [A.N.: swearword for Polish], there are the Yugos [A.N. swear word for people from former Yugoslavia], there they play cards, I don’t want that, I want the quiet, the quiet! (male, 53 years)Critique of noise and the people who produced it were closely interwoven at the deprived neighborhood. And, in the older adults’ memory, this noise had not always been there; it had evolved with the developments of the past decades. When they themselves had moved to the area some decades ago, everything had been nice and quiet; but after a while, strangers started moving in, and with them came the noise and the deprivation of the area as a whole.Well, when I came here 22 years ago, the 5th [A.N.: district] was one of the most beautiful districts. […] Reinprechtsdorfer Street used to be a wonderful shopping street, really great, with splendid shops, stores, prestigious stores, not such a ragtag as it is now. Yes, we had everything. […] Not something like casinos and kebab and noodles and all that shit there, right, that didn’t exist back then. One-Euro shops and all that junk; a butcher; where there’s now the Admiral [A.N.: casino] there used to be a tableware store and next to it a brick manufacturer, a great butcher, we’ve had five butchers, they all closed down because of that. […] Today all we have is cement and foreigners there, now in the 5th district. When the first immigrants came to the 10th district, when they went out of place, they came over across the city belt and now it’s over [A.N.: The “belt” is the main thoroughfare in Vienna that divides the outer and inner districts]. It’s only getting worse now. (male, 65 years)The narratives of the neighborhood’s development were full of bitterness and nostalgia, and people kept repeating: “Those times are over” or “the good times have gone.” In their perception, the newcomers—the immigrants—had changed the sensual and infrastructural landscape of the neighborhood; they had replaced the quiet with noise, the prestigious stores with junk stores. Even worse, it was perceived that they tried to replace the persons themselves: they occupied their places and pushed the “old” residents out.[…] because at the end, you couldn’t have come here anymore and you cannot go to Einsiedlerpark over there either because it belongs to the Turks. You don’t belong there anyway. […] Well, all the Turks that moved here, that would not even have a right to exist here and claim everything and get it. (male, 65 years)Complaining about the noise and with that, complaining about the people—the neighbors—seemed to be another way of distinction, a communicational performance of alienation, or estrangement from one’s own residential environment. Sound became noise in a process of sensorial othering: Languages one could not understand, noises one could not comprehend, people one could not relate to—many residents felt as having become replaced in their own environments (after many of them had been replaced in their workplace as well) and expelled by the new inhabitants. The residential area and its new inhabitants, they felt, disengaged them from much more than they disengaged from it. These conditions turned out to be particularly bothersome for older persons who had been living in their neighborhood area for quite some time, and for those that were socially most deprived.Curiously, when asked about the changes that affected their neighborhoods, many of the interviewed persons began to talk about the changes they experienced with aging. One commonality was in how they talked about both the change of their neighborhoods and themselves with time: first their association with decline and, second, the degree of self-identification or estrangement they felt in the process. Thus, the way they talked about aging can be framed in reference to PE as belonging (self-identification as an older person) and agency (assessed scope of action and self-efficacy in the aging process).Among all interview partners at both case sites, three types could be extracted based on criteria regarding whether a person acted to appropriate their neighborhood space (spatial agency), felt attached to their neighborhood (spatial belonging), acted to adapt or resist older age (aging agency) and self-identified as an older person (). Table 2.Agency and Belonging to Space and Age Note: Plus (+) refers to a high degree of agency respective belonging, minus (−) to a low degree of agency resp. belonging.The three types were unequally distributed across space (environments) and time (age groups) (Distribution is, however, in no way representative and highly dependent upon the different samples at the two case sites.). The first type, consisting mainly persons over the age of 75 years and living in the privileged area, had experienced decline in physical and mobility competencies, which limited their scope for appropriating the neighborhood space, even though they felt a strong sense of belonging to it. Due to those experienced restrictions, they also strongly self-identified as being old. Action scopes for resisting or adapting to older age were identified to some extent, such as going for daily walks to maintain a certain degree of fitness. Finally, decline was perceived as inevitable.It’s natural that the older person fails once in a while and that he is no longer able to do what he used to take for granted. (female, 91 years)The second type of interview partners was younger (between 58 and 72 years) and all were female. They only had “second-hand experience” (e.g., from their parents) of health decline in older age. They did not identify at all as being old and took various measures to resist aging (like cognitive training, frequent social interactions, or “dressing younger”).I mean, you may grow old, but you don’t have to grow blowsy and not much to look at, right? (female, 71 years)They showed the same level of agency in regards to their neighborhoods, which they strongly appropriated and even, at times, took action to change: One woman in the deprived neighborhood, for example, had started a petition as collective action to prevent “her park” from being turned into a parking lot.The third type consisted of two younger (53 and 65 years) males, both of whose interviews were cited in this article. Both described, among other things, having lost their jobs due to their age, and this experience—being labeled as old by the working world—had made them partly self-identify as old. However, this label clearly did not make them happy, as it decreased their social role from a productive member of society to somebody that was not needed anymore.I was definitely too old for a new job, from 50 on you can forget about it […] Well that is even worse. When you go somewhere today, in a company, they don’t ask you what you want to earn or your skills, but how old you are. Once you say 50 plus, well then we don’t need to talk any further, it’s done […] I learned typesets, in my times this was one of the best-paying jobs that even existed, and now this job doesn’t even exist anymore, the computer already killed it, no. Nobody needs a manual type setter anymore today, no.” (male, 65 years)Despite describing themselves as “old” throughout the interviews, they also did not completely agree with the label they had been assigned. For both men, age was something to be resisted but they did not entirely see a scope for action in this resistance. Similarly, they felt their neighborhood was a place to be abandoned but they did not see how they could do it and they saw no action scope to change it. DiscussionThis study posed the question of why some older adults engage with and some withdraw from public space, or more specifically, the public places in their neighborhoods. It addressed two questions:How are place attachment and spatial agency mutually related among older residents of deprived neighborhoods?How do place attachment and spatial agency influence late-life identities in deprived neighborhoods?The results challenge PE’s model of interrelation between agency and belonging as well as their causal effects on identity, wellbeing and autonomy. In this study, agency—as observed place appropriation, and place attachment—as subjective identification with one’s neighborhood, did not match. Instead, place appropriation was intense but so was spatial alienation. Hence, the relationship between spatial agency and spatial belonging is not necessarily positive. Whereas existing research does acknowledge gaps between agency and belonging when older adults lose mobility competence and are thus limited in their spatial agency, the opposite condition—vivid spatial engagement within one’s neighborhood without subjective place attachment—is mostly neglected.However, this result is not necessarily a contradiction to PE fit when considering the underlying data sources: In this study, spatial agency was collected through nonparticipant observation, whereas place attachment was collected through episodic interviews. If agency had also been collected through interview data, results would in fact fit the PE model: Male residents of the deprived case sites did not feel like they had control over their neighborhood’s development, even though they in fact exercised control through their spatial practices.Why is it that people who engage with their residential environments distance themselves from these environments at the same time? Referring to territorial stigma (; ), such verbal distancing can be a coping strategy to prevent one’s self-identity from being “stained” by environmental stigma. Hence, older adults might not identify with it their neighborhood to maintain a positive self-image. According to , coping strategies of stigmatized areas’ residents can either submit to and reproduce, or rebel against spatial stigma. Which strategy is being adopted by whom depends on the position and the trajectory in social and physical space. Hence, I propose to complement PE fit with Wacquant’s notion of territorial stigma.Consequently, the concepts used in PE fit can be differentiated into two mutually related factors (): observable (environmental context, environmental engagement, autonomy) and subjective (belonging, perceived agency, identity, wellbeing). Figure 2.Person–environment–engagement model (PEEM) as further development of PE fit. Own representation.Figure 2.Person–environment–engagement model (PEEM) as further development of PE fit. Own representation.With the addition of environmental conditions—comprising both the (infra-) structural requirements as well as the symbolic labelling of a neighborhood—and the observable engagement with the residential environment, a model of PE fit could consider social inequalities more comprehensively. Acknowledging Wacquant, territorial stigmatization is not a condition but a form of “action through collective representation fastened on place” (ibid: 1278). Different forms of environmental engagement either reproduce or challenge spatial inequalities that, again, manifest in concrete living conditions of older adults. In this study, older adults used both resistance strategies—like the woman who initiated collective action to retain her park—and reproduction strategies—like the men who denied their neighborhoods in front of us—the cultural capital-rich researchers. These forms of engagement have different effects on identity, wellbeing, and autonomy.From a sociological perspective, forms of engagement that reproduce social inequalities need particular attention. The study’s results point to (new) social inequalities that stretch into older age: There is a group of predominantly male, third-aged men who feel increasingly outpaced by societal developments. Losing their jobs to younger employees and losing their neighborhood to new residents, they felt expelled (cf. ), not disengaged, from the sociospatial environment they once belonged to. These inequalities have developed with what gerontology refers to as the “rejuvenation” of older age (), “mask of aging” (), or “structural lag” (): Adults are labeled as “old” by society at a much earlier age than when they themselves feel old. The active aging discourse has been welcomingly appropriated by a majority of older adults who share the view that age is something negative that can be resisted, if one just tries hard enough. Those who do not try hard enough get stigmatized; when they then get labeled as old, obviously, they must have done something wrong. This simultaneity of societal demands—being and not being old—opens new pitfalls for socially disadvantaged groups in older age.Unlike the generations before them, however, those older, expelled adults do not react by withdrawing from public space, but by spatial appropriation and subjective estrangement. This group is not resigning but struggling to protest against their expulsion from the world they once related to: They have raised their voices in political decisions (e.g., the 2016 “Brexit” and U.S. presidential election; cf. ) and are likely to engage in other forms of “deviant behavior.”This group’s disengagement is more multifaceted than gerontology is generally used to—their deviant kind of doing age is neither purely suppressed nor purely hegemonic—the older men observed in this study were seriously socioeconomically disadvantaged but they were also suppressing others (women, migrants) in their strong manner of place appropriation and setting up in-group boundaries. This group is both invisible and suppressed—in terms of gerontological and political consideration—and simultaneously very visible and oppressing—in their everyday life practices. It is a group that makes it hard to call for more participation in the development of neighborhoods and cities, and at the same time makes it even more necessary to do so. In addressing social inequalities in older age, (critical) gerontology should thus not only consider the poor, disadvantaged, disengaged elderly, but also the rebellious, resisting, provoking new generation of older adults.The small sample size and the sample composition, however, put limitations to the results. Data of the only woman interviewed at the deprived site (the “chaperone”) gives some clues on how a more gender balanced sample could have given more and different insights, as her pattern of place attachment and place appropriation differed greatly from the men’s. Moreover, despite many (older) migrants living at the deprived case site, migrants have partly been left out of analysis due to language difficulties. Their view, also, could be quite different. Hence, this qualitative, exploratory research generates assumptions that are yet to be tested and developed further.

References Issue Section:, AbstractPurpose of the StudyHome and community engagement are key contextual factors for aging well, particularly for older adults in vulnerable social positions. A community-based participatory action research project conducted in Western Canada examined how to best use the shared amenity spaces in a low-income seniors’ apartment complex in order to connect services and programs with tenants and to provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and create new relationships toward collaboration and service delivery.Design and MethodsPre-move deliberative dialogue workshops (n = 4) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees). Workshop participants (n = 24) generated ideas and plans on how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants.ResultsShared dialogue led to community investment and asset sharing by integrating the knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. This article highlights how collaborative planning approaches for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming), within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and community spaces), can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors. Contextual challenges to service provision are discussed, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive programming, and long-term funding.ImplicationsProlonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults. , , , The physical and social contexts of aging are important to an individual’s ability to age well and have their psychosocial needs met, or conversely, impede one’s ability to thrive. In later life, there are a variety of housing options available for seniors, ranging from independent living situations (seniors rent or own their homes), to supportive and assisted living situations (seniors receive minimal to moderate support with activities of daily living), to residential living situations (seniors are provided more significant levels of care). Among seniors with limited income who are situated in marginalized social positions, housing options are scarce, particularly compared to those with purchasing power who can reside in a living situation of their choosing.In contrast to “service-enriched housing for older persons” (see ), independent housing that does not provide on-site support for low-income seniors has been referred to as “unassisted affordable housing” (see ) or “age-segregated services without housing” (). Renters are challenged not only by the affordability of housing, but also by services and supports to enable independent living. This is especially the case in areas where rental costs have increased whereas incomes remain fixed ().Research has found that older renters, particularly those in subsidized housing, are disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, including activity limitations (), high rates of disability, and limited informal support (). Seniors who are part of marginalized socioeconomic or cultural groups are often in greater need of supportive environments in order to age well (). The lack of informal support alongside minimal affordable formal support options situates low-income seniors, particularly those living with challenging health conditions, at increased risk for nursing home placement. Intersectoral recommendations have been put forth () demanding the provision of safe, accessible, affordable housing with support services on-site to help older renters maintain their health, functioning, and independence thus delaying or avoiding nursing home placement, and reducing health and social care costs (; ). Thus, it is critical to determine solutions that support the needs of seniors who are living in affordable rental housing to reduce institutional costs, while enabling older adults to successfully age-in-place.Home and community engagement are key contextual factors for aging well, particularly for older adults in vulnerable social positions (). Older people are often housed in settings that do not meet their current place-based needs in terms of amenity space and program and service delivery (). As a result, older people increasingly find themselves isolated and marginalized when they move into senior-specific housing that is not fit-for-purpose (). Affordable housing that integrates services and amenities that address the physical, social, and environmental needs of older people can provide the necessary supports to age-in-place ().Seniors living in affordable rental housing have identified the importance of shared spaces () as offering opportunities for social interaction, physical activity, and monitoring of neighbors’ safety. For instance, social interactions could include having meals and informal meetings with other tenants, as well as engaging in various hobbies, games, activities, celebrations, and holiday events with other tenants (). Common spaces have also been identified as locations in which community organizations could offer exercise classes and thus help support the health and wellbeing of tenants (). In this sense, the programming of amenities and services within communal spaces have the opportunity to bring residents together, creating spaces for social networks and for hosting meaningful activities, as well as acting as a bridge with local community organizations.This article presents research from one phase of a longitudinal collaborative project in which a seniors’ housing society in Western Canada financed an affordable housing development, inclusive of shared indoor and outdoor spaces for senior tenants, partnering with the municipal government and developers, and collaborating with community organizations to explore ways to develop informal services and supports in and around the building (). This offered the opportunity to redirect focus away from the material features of the built environment (often prioritized in housing and planning developments) towards cultivating nonphysical, psychosocial supports for tenants. The research team was invited to join the partnership as academic experts to: (a) understand the challenges and opportunities experienced by seniors and service providers; (b) identify facilitators for and barriers to provision of services and supports to seniors; and (c) determine actions needed to better support service providers in serving seniors. To achieve these objectives, a longitudinal community-based participatory research (CBPR) project followed the development of a low-income seniors’ apartment complex over 18 months. Research SettingRosewood Gardens (pseudonym used for anonymity) is made up of two 16-story towers, totaling 296 one-bedroom units, inclusive of two units designated for two full-time, live-in, multilingual caretakers. The role of the live-in caretakers is to ensure a safe and secure living environment and to support tenants with building maintenance needs, asserting building bylaws and maintaining safety regulations, but are not mandated to support social programming for tenants. Rosewood Gardens is located in an urban area within close proximity of transportation and other services and amenities.The two Rosewood Gardens’ towers are connected by centralized community amenity spaces, including a: large multipurpose room (with bar and kitchen area); secured-access boardroom; arts-and-crafts room; games room; and hair salon with manicure/pedicure services. Additional amenity spaces include the entrance lobbies of each tower with sitting areas; a large secured outdoor courtyard landscaped with a walking path and gardens; and courtyard-level lounges (each with a TV, microwave, kitchen sink, chair/furniture) adjacent to the laundry facilities on the second level of each tower. As one representative from the housing society explained:They’re all connected; the two towers are connected with this hallway with centralized hobby room, et cetera, the games room. The idea is that we don’t want the tenants of one tower to feel that that is their tower, and Tower 2 is not part of us or vice versa. We wanted them to feel like they can flow easily between one tower and the other. That is basically the concept of the amenities that we have.There is no amenity fee charged to tenants and no meals or intermediate care are provided to tenants. Stipulations for tenancy in Rosewood Gardens include being low-income, ambulatory, and aged 60+ years. Tenants of Rosewoods Gardens are culturally diverse, reflective of the local community, with approximately 70% of East Asian decent and 30% of European decent.This study presents findings from an engagement process with the housing society and community stakeholders (e.g., nonprofit service providers), which identified how services and supports could be delivered to tenants in a sustainable manner while facilitating inclusion, accessibility and supportive environments. The aims of the current study are to: co-create solutions for the best use the shared amenity spaces in Rosewood Gardens; connect senior services and programs with tenants; and provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and develop new relationships toward collaborative and effective service delivery. Other data were also collected from tenants and is presented elsewhere (; ). Design and MethodsFor this longitudinal project, a CBPR approach was undertaken, recognizing the need for public participation and acknowledging that expert knowledge within communities can be mobilized to generate new understandings of innovative, sustainable, and inclusive community development. In line with CBPR principles, this project originated through consultation with key members of the housing society and municipal government. Representation from these organizations was foundational for decision-making and determining the direction of research throughout all stages of the study. As CBPR promotes the joint integration and transfer of expertise, inclusive participation, shared decision-making power, and data ownership across all partners (; ), stakeholders were included from the outset of this research to ensure a transdisciplinary perspective () and advance cross-sectoral working.Prior to tenants moving into Rosewood Gardens (tenants moved into the first tower March 2015; and the second tower August 2015), deliberative dialogue workshops were conducted with community and professional stakeholders. Deliberative dialogue is a method of discussion, unique from other forms of public discourse such as debating, negotiating, ideas mapping, and generating consensus (). It is aimed at creating a platform which purposefully invites diverse perspectives for generating collective thought toward potential solutions for a common purpose (). In research, deliberative dialogue provides an integrated framework for concurrently generating and analyzing data, engaging participants, and synthesizing evidence (). By capturing and integrating knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups, this method provides the opportunity to translate research into policy and practice through community investment and asset sharing. Participants worked together to generate ideas and future directions for creating supportive home and socially engaging environments at Rosewood Gardens focusing specifically on: the effective use of shared amenity spaces; identifying and mobilizing local resources and partnerships; bringing in senior-specific programming; and informing tenants of local resources. ParticipantsIndividuals were purposively recruited from a list of local service providers and existing project collaborators. Potential participants were invited to deliberative dialogue workshops by email if they were identified as having delivered senior-specific services in the local community or if they were a project collaborator. Inviting key stakeholders “to the table” to exchange ideas and to discuss opportunities, needs, and constraints for unassisted affordable seniors’ housing has been recommended as necessary for co-creating sustainable solutions (; ). In total, 24 participants attended the dialogue workshops, including community and professional stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees), with representation from the housing society, the building property management group, and the municipal government at each workshop. All participants provided informed consent and permission to be audio recorded; and no one was provided compensation for participation. Ethics approval was obtained from Simon Fraser University’s Institutional Review Board and participant names have been removed to protect identities. Data CollectionTo accommodate the demanding schedules of participants, four deliberative dialogue workshops were conducted over a 2-week period (one at the beginning and another at the end of the week); each lasting approximately 2 hr. Participants were asked to describe their understandings of how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants. Some example questions were: What are the different types of needs/aspirations of older adults for which they need services? What are your needs as service providers? What services and programs are available for older tenants (both by going out to the local community and being brought into Rosewood Gardens)? Open-ended responses were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; transcripts were de-identified to ensure confidentiality and entered into the NVivo qualitative software program () where data were coded and managed. Data AnalysesTwo qualitative researchers independently conducted thematic analysis of the deliberative dialogue data to identify emergent themes and patterns (; ). Analysis began with a read-through of each transcript for general and potential meanings. An initial coding structure was created, based on low-level/descriptive coding that resulted from coding units of text as themes by labeling with a word or phrase closely related to the participant’s account (). Through an iterative process of reading and rereading the text, codes were subject to constant comparative analysis to further refine the interpretation and definition of themes, the coding structure, and the patterns and relationships across codes (; ). The result was a detailed coding structure agreed upon by both researchers. Initial findings were presented during community advisory meetings and confirmed with participants for accuracy. ResultsParticipants discussed ways in which tenants could utilize the amenity space and bring in tailored services and programs. Dialogue data were organized into two overarching categories: (a) opportunities for social interaction and wellness programming; and (b) contextual challenges to service provision. Opportunities for Social Interaction and WellnessParticipants described several opportunities for social interaction and wellness programming both within the shared amenity spaces at Rosewood Garden and in the surrounding community. By understanding what community supports were available, the amenity spaces could be used for socialization and wellness programs unavailable elsewhere in the area. On-site OpportunitiesAccording to participants from the housing society, the purpose of including amenity spaces in Rosewood Gardens was to create places for tenants to engage in self-organized activities and for service providers to offer on-site programs and activities that could enhance tenant wellness. One participant interested in seeing programs delivered in Rosewood Gardens stated, “What we want to do and what the City has asked us to do, is to be aware of the wellness of the tenants that we have in there…” This participant elaborated on the goal of encouraging social interaction among tenants:We wanted to be able to provide services, activities, other sorts of opportunities within the complex, not only to help reduce the burden on the City facilities and other facilities around it, but also to build a sense of community within the complex, so that they didn’t always have to go out for these other activities, and we get more of a mixing of the tenants and just more social interaction…A key design feature conducive for the social programming at Rosewood Gardens was reported to be the purposeful location of shared spaces between the two towers and variety in amenity spaces:That area is accessible from both towers, so we’re hoping that there’ll be some inter-mingling between them, because we would expect that the two towers will be two different communities for the most part. We’re trying to encourage more interaction between them.Additionally, lounge areas located outside the second floor laundry rooms in each of the towers were intentionally designed to enhance social interactions between tenants:The reason we did that was so that while you are doing your laundry, you have a place to go. You don’t have to go back to your suite. What we are striving to do is to get the tenants to intermingle. …This is basically the City’s concern from a wellness point of view. They want to get people out of their suites, not locked away as quite often happens.Participants identified potential services and programs that could be delivered individually to tenants in their suites as well as to larger groups in the amenity spaces at Rosewood Gardens. Individual services included: housekeeping, meal delivery, transportation to appointments or the store, home visits, home care, and translation services. Programs and activities suggested for the shared amenity spaces included: blood pressure or glucose clinics; seminars on practical life skills; education on fraud and scams that target seniors; hearing health, aids, and tests; opportunities to stay active in mind and body; opportunities to connect and engage with one other; and financial/estate planning and funeral planning. One participant suggested having regular monthly health days, or information fairs, during which different service organizations from the community could set up tables to provide tenants with health- and wellness-related information:[Tenants] could come down, get a cup of coffee and sort of see what’s available in the community, to try and build that connection and then maybe get them out to different programs and services to make sure their needs are being met.Informal services were also suggested, which would be no cost and generated by tenants, such as neighborly check-ins (or doorknob card check-ins) or a lending library (with books, videos, puzzles) in the two lounge spaces. Notably, services offered to seniors would fluctuate according to changing needs: “As people’s needs change, we’ve kind of changed with those needs…” As well, as one participant reported, it is important to not assume what tenants may want or need:What I’m hearing around the table is that there is interest in making sure that people have access to information about fall prevention, about healthy aging-in-place, about community supports, about transitions to other living arrangements should they need them, and again I think we need to be careful that we don’t presuppose that we know what the tenants want.Participants described the importance of overcoming limitations of the built environment and reaching seniors who may be isolated in their apartments. A participant from the housing society described the design of Rosewood Gardens: “A typical floor plan has 10 units surrounding a central service core and elevators. This small number of units per floor, in a high-rise configuration reduces the opportunity for interaction between residents in the building.” This participant continued to report a need:…to try to overcome that design limitation by doing other things in the building that would pull [tenants] out of their units and into other parts of the building and give them other things to do. …Seniors are going to be healthier if they have more interaction, if they have friends. People can monitor each other in terms of how they’re doing health-wise and any other situations that are going on in their life.Thus, being able to get into buildings where people live offers socially isolated seniors more opportunity to engage and learn about available community programs. Community-Based OpportunitiesBeyond having services and programming brought on-site, participants discussed the close proximity of Rosewood Gardens to other senior-specific programming in the surrounding area. A participant from the housing society stated, “If our tenants want something that we haven’t provided, there is the senior center just down the street…or availability all within a close proximity.” As well, participants identified the need for tenants to make use of services already available in various locations throughout the community. As one service provider stated:There are people already doing a lot of things that we’ve brought up here that the folks living there will need. The big thing will be the balance: Do we want to move some of it in there so they don’t have to come out; or is it finding the ones that are isolated in there and using resources that are around the table to get them to come to already existing programs that are close to them?Services and programs identified by participants as available to seniors in the community included free access to Internet and computers, as well as low-cost technology training courses; self-care workshops and seminars around healthy aging, prevention, and coping with age-related changes; cooking classes; legal advice; financial planning; assistance with taxes and applications for subsidized housing and disability or old age benefits; advocacy; and counseling and support services for people with substance use or addictive behaviors. Participants suggested that if a single staff person at the different organizations could be dedicated to tenants of Rosewood Gardens, the tenants would have a “go-to” person for helping with their various needs, easing the navigation challenges often experienced when accessing social supports. One service provider explained the need for multiple organizations to collaborate toward supporting seniors’ independence: “It takes a network of service providers and public service providers in order to maintain that independence.” Contextual Challenges to Service ProvisionParticipants discussed contextual challenges to service provision, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive services and programming, and long-term funding.Key to the provision of social programming in Rosewood Gardens, participants noted that tenants need to be informed of the different service and program options. Though a challenge, participants reported on potential solutions. For instance, one participant suggested that representatives come on-site to present information on opportunities in the area. Announcements (in both Chinese and English) were a reported need, either via e-mail from the property manager or posted on notice boards in the lobby and elevators of each tower. Potentially, the housing society should develop a resource guide for their tenants. Understanding the communication needs of tenants and the best way for the different parties to communicate into the 21st century was noted as important. Participants identified a variety of communication methods, including suggestion boxes, an assigned tenant steward from each floor, or online communication tools (e.g., email and website posts).Participants emphasized the need for program coordination in Rosewood Gardens, either by an individual (e.g., a paid employee or unpaid volunteer) or a group (e.g., a tenants’ committee). Though there is an on-site building manager and two caretakers employed by the housing society, program coordination is not part of their job description. As one service provider cautioned, however, “Most people may be coming [to Rosewood Gardens] assuming it is independent living, and they don’t want to be treated like…they have a recreational programmer or all that kind of stuff; that’s not of interest to them.” Although participants suggested that a program coordinator could be valuable, this might not be of interest to all tenants. Instead, tenants may want to lead the program coordination themselves, as one participant stated:[There is] a huge pool of talent within the building itself, people who actually live there. They’re not just looking for somebody else to do something for them; they’re quite capable of doing something for themselves and for their neighbors.Having sustainable service coordination and communication was also identified as a challenge in the context of not-for-profit service delivery. With competing time demands, providers reported often being over-stretched. Participants expressed the need for contact information of key personnel responsible for management and operations of Rosewood Gardens to enable the development and implementation of programs and activities in the shared amenity spaces. Moreover, participants reported a need for coordination between management of Rosewood Gardens and community service providers to serve seniors with complex health issues:It’s probably a bit naïve to think that there won’t be issues of mental health or addictions or different care needs that are going to come up and where services from outside are going to need to come in. And so that’s where there’ll have to be some collaboration. I know for myself, some of the outreach work that I’ve done, there’s been times when I’m concerned about one of my clients inside, they’re not answering their phone, they’re not answering their door. So to be able to call a manager and say, “Can you let me in or go knock yourself, or however that works, because I’m concerned about this person,” without having to go get the police involved to come and break that door. There needs to be sort of that collaboration between the actual building and whoever’s managing it, and our agencies.Further, participants expressed that policies surrounding space usage should be established to determine which organizations and service providers are eligible to host programs, activities, and events in the shared amenity spaces. For example, participants suggested that some organizations may use the amenity space as a business opportunity to market products and services to tenants. As such, organizations and providers should be vetted to ensure appropriateness and tenant safety.Another challenge noted by participants was the need for culturally diverse and responsive services and programming. Within the community in which Rosewood Gardens is situated, there is a large Chinese population, and having services and programs offered in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English was reported to be an important component toward generating culturally responsive service delivery. One notable service gap was that free English language classes were only available for people living in the area for less than 5 years, though many seniors have lived in Canada for 10 to 20 years, yet still have limited English language skills. Service providers who speak a variety of languages are needed at various access points, both within Rosewood Gardens and in the wider community.A final challenge noted by participants was the need for long-term funding. As an unassisted independent living residence for low-income seniors, financial challenges for establishing on-site social programming were reported by the housing society. It was anticipated by one participant that low or no cost programs could be introduced into the shared amenity spaces to support tenants:Because of the nature of the rents, keeping them low, we cannot fund the cost of programs…it’s our hope that…we can attract people to come in and put programs on for our tenants whether it’s yoga…whatever games they want to play, or whatever.A representative from the housing society stipulated that their role and responsibility within Rosewood Gardens is that of landlord and as such, it is important that sustainable funding is acquired to employ an individual to coordinate on-site programmatic development:If someone came forth and said, “we will fund a coordinator” then we [housing society] would give consideration to it. And that coordinator could arrange all these things that you’re talking about. But that is not our job; we are a landlord trying to do the best we can for a particular group of people who are seniors.Indeed, for the housing society, one of their primary goals for participating in the research process was to determine ways of acquiring funding for a staff program director since building management and maintenance personnel do not have time to undertake the task of program coordination. DiscussionProvision of services and supports for low-income seniors in unassisted housing has been identified as imperative for both individual wellbeing and operationally within government structures (; ). With encouragement from the municipal government, the housing society that manages Rosewood Gardens identified the need for services in and around this development. Through a series of deliberative dialogues, the present study identified opportunities for enhancing social interaction and wellness programming in the shared amenity spaces, bringing in community-based supports, and addressing contextual challenges to service provision. By grounding this work in experiences identified through a participatory process, the current research has immediate application for Rosewood Gardens (). Though context-specific, findings can also inform the development of future low-income service-housing collaborations to serve low-income, independent seniors. Collaborative planning for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming) within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and neighborhood spaces) can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors.Research on seniors’ living situations largely acknowledges the importance of the built environment in enabling or disabling aging well, and as a result, home modification initiatives have been popular (). However, initiatives to address the psychosocial needs of community-living seniors, including enhanced social connectedness, remain sparse. Research has explored how the physical environment supports or impedes the ability to age-in-place often driven by a model of person-environment congruence that compares a person’s physical and mental capacity against environmental demands and how these affect on a person’s ability to perform activities of daily living (). Although this approach has been useful, less attention has been given to the experiential dimension and the way older adults develop a sense of home, community, identity, and belonging.Aligned with participants’ reports,  argues the importance of having service coordinators available to senior tenants in multi-unit rental properties as a mechanism to efficiently organize, deliver, and purchase affordable services. Supporting seniors through the organization and provision of services and supports can lead to healthcare cost savings. Furthermore, appointing a service coordinator in rental buildings can increase efficiency and affordability of services that enable senior tenants to remain independent (; ; ; ). Importantly, findings from the present study offer support for the idea that older tenants are able to self-organize and create a democratized body to act in a service coordination capacity. The prospect of leading governance roles in building committees, with opportunities to participate in decision-making, has been identified as an interest of older adults (). Thus, services are not simply provided to seniors, but seniors should be acknowledged as active participants in creating and acquiring activities, services, and support. This form of empowerment enables older adults to not only become and remain engaged through positive contributions to their communities, but more importantly, it serves to enhance their quality of life ().Participants identified the potential for older tenants to become socially isolated in Rosewoods Gardens as a result of the built environment (i.e., architecturally through the 16-story tower design), which has been recognized (; ). The negative impact of social isolation on older adults has been widely acknowledged () and initiatives to reduce isolation in order to promote health and wellbeing are on the rise (). Meanwhile, the development of socially inclusive amenity spaces within a comfortable and known setting (i.e., Rosewood Gardens) provides the opportunity for service providers to better engage with socially isolated tenants who may be unlikely to seek community services off-site. Social connection through the affordance of common areas in affordable housing has been identified as an opportunity to reduce isolation among tenants ().In addition to identifying and introducing services and programs into Rosewood Gardens, encouraging tenants to engage in social activities in the community was an important goal. As such, on-site services can be augmented by community-based services (). Previous research has highlighted the importance of access to affordable transportation to provide older renters better access to community services, such as family doctors or shopping facilities. Though it is not a mandate of independent housing management to offer transportation services to tenants, arranging this kind of service (at low or no cost) with the municipal government would serve to improve the quality of life of senior tenants (). Having accessible opportunities for social engagement and having housing linked with, or in close proximity to, amenities, services, and social activities can enable independence in later life ().Challenges to service provision identified by participants included the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive services and programming, and sustainable financial support. The need for culturally responsive services is reflected in previous research, which has also identified how poor language skills can limit social inclusivity, reducing a sense of acceptance by older adult members of minority groups in Canada ().One limitation to deliberative dialogues is that these are a series of “dialogues,” emphasizing the exchange of ideas with less prioritizing on the execution of actionable items. For instance, a central challenge identified by participants was the lack of financial resources to ensure the implementation and sustainability of on-site services and supports. Though solutions (e.g., developing a voluntary tenants’ board and fundraising to hire a program coordinator) were offered, there were no commitments made to follow-through. Instead, the onus was placed on the researchers to put these actions into place, which was neither feasible nor appropriate. Hence, what would further enhance this method is the appendage of an “accountability” feature where civil servants “pledge” () to carry out an action at the end of the deliberative dialogue. A second limitation was that workshop participants did not include tenants of Rosewood Gardens, though this was an intentional decision made in collaboration with the housing society for this stage of the research. In other phases of this longitudinal research, tenants have been engaged in place-making research (; ). The engagement of local service providers and other community members with vested interest in seniors’ wellbeing led to community investment and asset sharing through a shared platform that enabled the generation and integration of knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. Key successful features of deliberative dialogues, which informed recommendations and solutions included bringing together diverse voices, establishing a common purpose at the outset of each dialogue, and having realistic expectations for what “real-world” () solutions “should” resemble. ConclusionThe value of supporting low-income senior tenants of multi-unit properties should not be understated. As affirmed by participants, affordable rental housing is intended for tenants who can independently live in these settings; and when this is no longer possible, they are often forced to move to a more supportive location. In corroborating the notion that low-income seniors can do well in supported living contexts, when compared to older adults living in private homes, residents of senior housing have reported higher quality housing and neighborhood safety; as well, low-income older adults in senior housing reported better self-rated health compared to low-income older adults in private home residents. Because low-income seniors are more limited in their options, it is up to government and social service organizations to provide services in the least restrictive and most supported housing and social environment. Prolonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults.

References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesThere is a substantial body of literature on the importance of the environment in the lives of older adults. Nonetheless, to date, there has been limited research on everyday activities of urban older adults in public open spaces. The present study examined the activities of older adults in public open spaces in Israel with a specific focus on age and gender as potential variables of relevance.Research Design and MethodsUsing still photography, we systematically photographed four sessions in two different public outdoor settings attended by older Israelis. Still photographs were converted to narrative descriptions, and then coded, quantified, and compared using descriptive statistics.ResultsThe majority (311, 97%) of older adults arrived alone to the public setting. Of these, 44% formed a social group of two or more people, whereas the remaining older adults stayed alone. When social interactions occurred, they were primarily gender homogenous (69%); women were more likely to integrate in spontaneous social conversations and men were more likely to participate in common games.Discussions and ImplicationsOur findings call attention to the important role played by the outdoor environment as a venue for social activities among older adults. The findings further stress the high levels of aloneness experienced by older adults, which do not seem to be alleviated by the mere attendance of public spaces.  , , , , , “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.” Zechariah, Chapter VIIIRowles situated the convergence space in “the general schema” of five geographic life circles (, p.168) and characterized it as follows: “the private home is situated in the center, and the surrounding areas are the surveillance zone, the neighborhood, the city, and beyond.” Each geographic circle is characterized by different levels of physical closeness and mobility. The core idea is that as people age, their living space shrinks. One reason is a decline in mobility, which results in older people concentrating their efforts and lives in the most accessible and immediate vicinity, namely, their home. A second reason is changes in the social composition and function of the places surrounding their homes. These changes make older adults feel like they do not belong, and cause them to find alternative places that do not exclude them. Older adults adjust to changing indoor and outdoor situations by expanding the concept of home beyond their private dwelling to the surveillance zone ().Between the abstract concept of a domestic sense in outdoor areas and actual personal homes, rests the physical living space that  called the “surveillance zone.” It is “a watchful space from the house, and extended to encompass that space external to accommodation and forming a ‘buffer zone’ with the widowed society” (, p. 167).  describe this physical area, between the private home and the neighborhood streets, as a transition area between the inside and the outside that is used for personal and social roles that can be performed inside the house or outdoors, including: watching, sitting, eating, reading, tending much-loved flowers, walking, or playing.Older adults’ shrinking living spaces can grow by “leaking” into the nearest public area.  has argued that “home” is a fluid and fluctuating space that extends beyond the household to include community centers, meeting places, corner stores, and other dwellings, as well as social interactions with family, friends, paid workers, and community members. Home becomes a place that extends beyond the walls of the house and garden to include the neighborhood, community, city, and beyond (). An example of this can be found in a study by  that examined the ideal home for older adults. One important finding was the connection of the “nest” (home) to the wider community. In search for ways to express a sense of home, older adults identified nearby services, which they described as convenient (for instance, being able to shop without the need for transportation) but also as possible spaces for interaction with others. These highly valued interactions were highlighted in relation to specific activities (e.g., attending church or a book club) as well as in relation to superficial contacts (e.g., a concierge who regularly greets them). Older Adults and the Urban EnvironmentResearch on older adults in public open spaces has addressed the physical elements of the environment as potential obstacles to or facilitators of accessing public parks, for instance); ; ; ; ). These studies reflect a general assumption that older adults tend to walk in the “open air” mainly for the sake of their health.A different line of research has examined consumer behaviors in malls. This line of research could potentially provide insights regarding the activities of older adults in urban areas, including the importance of public places for the social welfare of older adults.  have argued that mall shopping involves not only the consumption of goods but also enhances emotional satisfaction that is derived from the ambience, the opportunity to meet friends or acquaintances and watch passersby. It has been argued that feelings of loneliness among older consumers might increase the consumption of goods (). Consistently,  indicate explored the experiences of seniors in four Australian shopping centers. They have found that the shopping center is a prime site for interaction, communication, and social outing. Aside from shopping, the participants generally identified social activities—such as meeting family and friends, going to a movie, watching, and sharing a meal or a hot drink—as key reasons for going to the shopping center. An Israeli study () has proposed an age division with regard to consumers’ behaviors. Whereas older adults born between 1921 and 1940 appear to be the least engaged in mall shopping, the baby boomers, born between 1941 and 1960 tend to sit in coffee shops and use the mall to socialize with others. Age and Gender Segregation and the EnvironmentThe environment likely plays an important role with regard to both age and gender segregation.  have long argued for the importance of considering the meso-level in any discussion concerning ageism. Reportedly, in modern society, there is a clear segregation between the young and the old, based on pre-planned life scripts, which include education, family creation, and work and finally, retirement (). When the younger and older generations do not socially engage, ageism is likely to flourish (). Consistent with this claim, it has been stressed that age segregation is highly prevalent in the urban environment and tends to intensify ageism towards older adults ().Similarly to age, gender is another basis, on which the environment reinforces segregation and inequality (). Gender segregation could be attributed not only to the built environment, however, but also to gender differences in social skills and social interaction. In general, women are considered as the main gatekeepers in social interactions, whereas men are seen as less socially active. Whereby women develop intimate social contacts and tend to have discussions around personal issues, men are more likely to connect on the basis of mutual interests (). Yet, women are more likely than men to report loneliness (). The Present StudyThe present study aims to examine activities that older adults are engaged in public open spaces. Although informative, past research has largely examined older adults in green parks or malls. These spaces are not necessarily integral parts of the living environment of urban older adults and do not represent the “surveillance zone.” At least in Israel, most urban areas do not offer easy access to green parks or shopping malls (). Hence, older adults have to actively seek out these settings. Because older adults tend to be confined to their local neighborhoods, due to health and functional limitations (; ), research has to address their nearby surroundings, rather than more remote specialized settings. Moreover, past research has primarily examined the health effects of the environment on older adults by focusing on mobility, accessibility, or fresh air. It has paid a lesser attention to the environment as a facilitator of or a barrier to the social participation of older adults (; ).The study adds to a growing body of knowledge by examining public open spaces, in which urban older adults gather with no formal guidance or planning of any authorities or service providers. We aim to classify, describe and count the different activities urban older adults are engaged in when they attend public open spaces. Fueled by our hypotheses concerning age segregation () and gender differences in social interactions (), we compare activities between older and younger passerby, and between men and women. To document these activities, we use a visual research method; specifically, we rely on systematic snapshots produced over several occasions (). MethodsThe present study photographed scenes in public open spaces. We used a visual research method—the review of still photographs (; ; )—to examine the activities of older adults who spend time in public open spaces. Visual research is a tool that relies on still images produced by a camera to gather information (; ). It involves the production, organization, and interpretation of images (). Visual research follows the rationale that images provide information that cannot be gained otherwise (). Both visual sociology and visual anthropology are grounded in the idea that valid scientific insights can be acquired through observing, analyzing, and theorizing about visual manifestations, which may include the behaviors of people and the material products of a culture (). Visual images can evoke emotions, abstract ideas, and the shared human experience (). They provide evidence that is difficult to put into words. Moreover, this unique technology allows slowing down or repeating observations for a deeper reflection on perceptions and meanings (). Site SelectionThe present study was conducted in the city of Holon, Israel. Holon is a medium-sized city of 186,400 inhabitants, located in the Tel Aviv metropolitan (). According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, economically and socially, the city is located in the middle of the Israeli scale. (). Holon is a Jewish city, composed of almost 100% Jews ().The systematic research process begins at the research design stage, by identifying the proper sites for photography (), including the choice of dates and plans to re-photograph in order to create a solid sample (). The selection of the photographed sites was done following a very thorough preparation. The first author has worked as a geographer and service planner in the city for 6 years. She specifically selected sites that had a high presence of older adults. When choosing the sites, the researcher consulted with municipal employees who were familiar with the city, such as inspectors and police officers.A two-layer map was created for the purpose of selecting appropriate sites for this study. The first layer painted the city according to older adults’ housing density—based on the municipality’s housing data, and a second layer of older adults’ gathering places—was based on information provided by the city employees. Based on this map, it became clear that open commercial spaces in the older neighborhoods of the city, which were characterized by a high density of older adults’ households, had a high presence of older adults.The two open commercial spaces, examined in this study, are located in two neighborhoods that are inhabited by a dense population of older adults (women over 62 and men over 67; based on the definition of retirement age of the National Insurance Institute of Israel). The percentage of older adults in the two neighborhoods ranges between 17% and 24.4% (). This is higher than the current percentage of older adults in the country, which stands at about 11% (). The commercial centers that serve as the neighborhoods’ central places were built in the 60’s of the previous century and now include shops, cafes, restaurants, banks, and nearby health clinics ().Each site was photographed on two occasions: in the summer and in the winter. These two seasons were selected because they reflect the two extreme weather conditions in Israel. During these two seasons, staying outdoors is not always enjoyable or feasible. In contrast, the autumn and spring are quite mild and are not always distinguishable. Each of the two settings was photographed both in the morning and at noon. Because our preliminary observation and consultation suggested that older adults are less likely to stay outdoors in the afternoon or evening, we did not photograph during these times of the day. Data CollectionDuring each photography session, the first author photographed the entire area and all people who were present, unrelated to their age. This created a complete 360 degree representation of all the people and occurrences, present in the public open commercial spaces, as well as possible changes which have occurred during each of the four shootings. Each session lasted between one and one and half hours. Date Analysis and  have suggested a five-stage model for the analysis of photographed information. In the first stage, the database is organized and observed as a whole in order to examine it within the research context (). In the second stage, each photograph is scrutinized using a descriptive narrative (), to identify repetitive themes and behaviors that will serve the coding stage that follows. The third stage is the coding, or the addition of labels to each descriptive narrative (). The fourth stage involves structural analysis, such as measuring distances, counting heads, and comparing movements (). The final stage involves the revision of the entire database and re-coding (; ).Each image was assigned both an index number and a scene number, because people were often photographed from different angles. The scene number prevented counting or describing the same person more than once, even if there were changes in the location or composition of photographed people. Each of the scenes was cataloged by (a) a description of the actions older people are engaged in and (b) the number of older persons, broken down by gender, as well as the presence of younger people or caregivers. It is important to note that older adults were not asked for their age. Hence, the classification was done based on their physical attributes (e.g., hair style, posture, wrinkles, dressing style).We searched for actions (e.g., sitting, walking, watching, reading a newspaper, talking, or shopping) and for social situations (e.g., a chance encounters, a common game, no interaction, or a person who is alone). To create a coding scheme, we identified recurring patterns of actions and social situations and created common definitions. Finally, in order to determine whether the behaviors engaged by older adults differed from those engaged by younger adults, we conducted chi-square analyses. We also conducted chi-square analyses to compare the various behaviors across gender.All photographs were reviewed and coded by the first author. To validate the coding process, the coding of 20% of the images was conducted by two additional independent researchers and an inter-rater agreement of 0.92 was obtained. All three individuals involved in the initial coding of the pictures are geographers, who specialize in urban planning. A fourth reviewer (the second author; a clinical psychologist) assisted in the classification and definition of the coding scheme. Disagreements between coders were discussed and resolved through a consensus process. Ethical IssuesWhen images are taken in public places, it is impossible to gain the consent of all people involved. Hence, it is viewed as acceptable (and legal) to use these images without their expressed consent (Wiles, Coffey, Robison, & Prosser, 2012). Nevertheless, the researcher should act responsibly to protect the photographed people and should avoid using images in a way that will harm their privacy and dignity. Hence, in this study, images are displayed in a blurred form and the findings are based on a textual description. This procedure was approved by the researchers’ university. ResultsA General Impression of the SitesThe first impression from the photographed sites is that these are “old people’s places.” The “old” character of the places emerges from the buildings, shops, and open spaces; it is reflected in the mixture of shops and products for sale—small grocery stores and supermarkets, Russian food stores (non-Kosher), textiles and fabrics, inexpensive fashion stores—all of which match older adults’ life style. The inexpensive restaurants and cafes seem to have old-fashioned décors that have not been updated for years.The first site is composed of two neighboring square spaces. One is an outdoor space, the primary city square (a quad), which is often used for the city’s outdoor events. In this outdoor space, there is a long row of benches along one side. The other site is an enclosed space, with benches scattered in different ways: some are scattered around a tree, where they are placed back to back, and some are facing one another so that people can look at each other. The second space includes the inner yard of a shopping center and a small nearby park. In the commercial space, there are several crescent-shaped groups of benches, and some benches are placed on both sides of a large tree that provides shade.The sun and shade play an important role in determining people’s location. In photographs taken in the summer, the people are mainly in shaded areas, whereas in the winter, people are mainly in the sun. Hence, people are mostly concentrated in desired locations. In both sites, there are always people present on all photographs. Even during Israel’s very hot summer, when most people would rather be indoors, many older adults seem to be spending time outdoors. Age SegregationThe first overall observation is that older adults constitute the majority in these two public open spaces. A total of 423 people were photographed over the four time periods. Of these, 311 were classified as older adults (56% men and 44% women), 69 were younger adults, not related to the older adults in the photographs and 43 were caregivers, who accompanied older adults. Thirty-two people (10% of all older adults) were photographed in a wheelchair. Fifteen women, but no men, were photographed with a walker.Compared with the older adults (31, 10%), younger adults (non-caregivers) were more likely to be in movement, with the goal of changing locations, rather than staying in one place (50, 72%; χ2[1] = 130.8, p < .001). The vast majority of older adults arrived to the public space alone (97%). The majority of older adults (56%) remained alone throughout the entire period. Yet, 44% of the older adults were photographed as they engage with others. Hence, we identified two main categories: Situations in which older adults are alone and situations where older adults are in contact with others. These situations were subdivided into six subcategories. Examples of the six subcategories are provided in . Figure 1.“Aloneness”: An old man sitting alone on a bench, reading a newspaper. Behind him, there is a group of young people.Figure 1.“Aloneness”: An old man sitting alone on a bench, reading a newspaper. Behind him, there is a group of young people.

Figure 3.“Alone in movement”: An old man walking with a shopping cart.Figure 3.“Alone in movement”: An old man walking with a shopping cart. Figure 4.“Transferred”: Older adults, transferred by their caregivers.Figure 4.“Transferred”: Older adults, transferred by their caregivers. Figure 5.“Meeting”: A group of older men engaged in backgammon.Figure 5.“Meeting”: A group of older men engaged in backgammon. Figure 6.“Together”: Three older women sitting on a common bench, talking. Facing them are two women, with a shopping cart. On a nearby bench, an old man is sitting alone.Figure 6.“Together”: Three older women sitting on a common bench, talking. Facing them are two women, with a shopping cart. On a nearby bench, an old man is sitting alone.The first category of older adults alone included the following four subcategories: (a) “Aloneness”—Older adults sitting alone, without any interaction with another person (16.7%); (b) “Gathering”—older adults sitting alone next to other older adults, who are also alone (21.2%). For example, a woman and a man sitting separately on two nearby benches; (c) “Alone in movement”—Older adults who are in motion, alone, for example, walking to a shop, roaming; (10%); and (d) “Transferred”—Older adults, transferred by their caregivers (8.0%).The second category included two subcategories in which older adults are in contact with others: (e) “Meeting”—A few people who come together to participate in a social gathering for the purpose of card games, dominoes, etc. (19.6%); and (f) “Together”—A group of several people, engaged in a common conversation (24.4%). Whereas activities classified as “Meeting” seemed to be pre-planned around a common interest, activities classified as “Together” appeared to occur naturally, without prior acquaintance or planning. Gender Differences shows the results by gender. Overall, 56% of the older adults were photographed alone, with no significant difference between men (58%) and women (56%). As for older adults in contact, there were significant differences between men and women. It appears that men (29.9%) were more likely than women (6.6%) to engage in an organized meeting with a clear aim to play cards, backgammon, or dominoes (e.g., “Meeting;” χ2[1] = 31.08, p < .001). A total of 24.4% managed to fit into a random gathering with others and engage in spontaneous conversation (“Together”). The majority in this group were women: 35.0% compared with 16.1% men (χ2[1] = 31.08, p < .001). Table 1.A Descriptive Analysis of Actions and Situations of Older Adults by Gender Another gender issue is the tendency to form gender homogeneous groups, that is, groups composed of all women or all men. Out of all 32 social groups classified as “Meeting” or “Together,” 69% were gender-homogenous. Eight of these groups consisted of all men, who mostly engaged in table games tournaments (“Meeting”), whereas fourteen consisted of women, engaged in what appears to be spontaneous conversations (e.g., “Together”). DiscussionThis study explores the phenomenon of older adults spending time outdoors during the day. The unique contribution of this study is that the place under study is not formally organized for older adults. Rather, it represents a natural social laboratory, a place that is not defined or designated for older adults. There is no sign that marks the place, and there are no designated services for older adults, such as the availability of social workers or nursing staff. The place does not require enrollment or membership, and there is no guide or therapist in charge. Nevertheless, many older adults spontaneously gather there to do as they please—move around, make connections, or remain alone.The ture that emerges from the study underscores the importance of public spaces in the lives of older adults. The city public spaces are the continuation of the private home, especially for those older adults who are alone. These places, which are close to older adults’ private homes and within their familiar neighborhood, fit Rowles’s description () of the smaller sphere of life that surrounds the private homes of older adults: the “surveillance zone.” Age Segregation and the EnvironmentThe description of social situations and activities of older adults in these places creates the impression that the older adults “feel at home” comfortable and secure. Geographic gerontology theories highlight the development of “a sense of home away from home.” This concept describes how, in the process of adapting to decreased mobility and a reduction in the area that is accessible to them, along with a reduction in the number of social relationships (), older adults expand their concept of home to include the familiar neighborhood, the community and the city (). Older adults’ convergence in safe places aims to increase their sense of control over the environment and maintain their independence and continued sense of membership in society (). They do this by concentrating in places where they can spend time on a routine basis (; ; ). In contrast to green parks or shopping malls, which are often located in the outskirts of the city (), the places examined in the present study constitute the nearby living environment of urban older adults; not directly part of their home, yet located in close proximity and easily accessible. As can be seen in the present study, these places are relatively accessible even to those older adults who rely on canes or wheelchairs. Older adults can reach these places on their own or through the assistance of a caregiver. The vast picture that emerges is that through their presence in large numbers, older adults have created unique places to meet their needs.Our findings are consistent with  claim for an age division in society. Intergenerational contact was almost absent from the photographed scenes. In this study, the only subcategory, which involved both young and old people, consisted of older adults being transferred by their caregivers. Moreover, whereas the majority of older adults photographed, were sedentary, the younger people in the photographs, seemed to be in movement. Hence, the two age groups likely attend these spaces for different reasons. The clear age division identified in this study is inconsistent with current calls of the World Health Organization towards age friendly cities that cater to all age groups and facilitate intergenerational contact (the ).Another interesting finding, which distinguishes the present study from past research (; ; ; ) is the focus on the social purpose that these public spaces likely have. Whereas much of the literature has focused on green parks as places that provide opportunities for fresh air and facilitate older adults’ engagement in health behaviors, the present study shows that urban older adults favor public open spaces for social purposes. Older adults do not simply pass through. Rather, the streets and the squares are places to remain in. Although more than half of all older adults in these settings remained alone within the entire period of photography, a little less than half made social contact with others. Hence, the present study clearly documents that the “surveillance zone” has a social purpose for older adults. Aloneness and the Urban EnvironmentThe concept of aloneness presented here does not refer to a state of mind, the subjective feelings of loneliness, but rather describes a person who is on his or her own. A notable finding is that more than half of the older adults remained alone over the entire photographing period. This suggests that even when older adults go outdoors to bustling places, many remain alone without any social contact. A study on older adults’ loneliness has found that women are more likely to report loneliness than man (). This is inconsistent with the present study, which has shown that women are more likely to participate in occasional conversations compared with men. However, this discrepancy could be explained by the hypothesis that men are embarrassed to report loneliness (). Hence, the findings stress the advantage of visual research, which can point to innovative directions of understanding the experiences of older adults, beyond the reliance on self-report.Of the 311 older adults who were photographed, only a few seemed to be with a partner of the opposite sex. In addition, there were only a few situations in which older men and women spoke with each other (in a group of two people). Although we cannot conclude that these men and women do not have a life partner, it can be hypothesized that there is a connection between the situation in which they were photographed—namely, being alone—and their wish to go outdoors in the city and remain there. In support of our observation, a study on older adults’ sense of loneliness has found that loneliness in Israel is especially prevalent among the separated and the widowed ().The large number of older adults who were seen alone in open commercial areas is consistent with another study that examined the social contacts of widowed older adults and found that they tend to participate in more informal social activities than do the pre-widowed (). The researchers have argued that although social participation is a strategy for dealing with the loss of a spouse, a significant proportion of widows do not have the resources to do so. Hence, one can interpret the large presence of older adults who were photographed on their own in nearby commercial areas as being fueled by a shortage of social resources. Gender Differences and the EnvironmentAlthough there were no gender differences in the number of older adults who were alone, consistent with past research (), there were significant gender differences with regard to type of social activities men and women engaged in. Whereas men were more likely to participate in what appeared to be pre-planned, table games (e.g., “Meeting”), women were more likely to engage in spontaneous conversations (e.g., “Together”). Moreover, most interactions of several older adults were gender-homogeneous, that is, composed of only men or only women. It is important to note that these were not religious people who strived for gender segregation, at least not based on their appearance and what we know about the religious characteristics of city residents in these areas. Hence, the findings clearly stress the tendency towards gender segregation among older adults in open public spaces. ImplicationsThe aim of this study was to bring the image of older adults to the front stage, to the attention of researchers, policy makers, and planners. Academically, visual research can be a prelude for further research on older adults’ life in the city, especially because images reflect spontaneous social processes, without guidance or organization. The picture that emerges from this research shows that older adults create places for themselves by reaching out to spaces abuzz with activity. This is contrasted with the image of older adults who prefer quiet green spaces for personal solitude ().Instead, our findings stress the preference of a substantial number of older adults towards informal activities within urban areas. Older adults come to these places in order to spend time. Therefore, these places should be designed for long periods of stay, rather than for passersby. The municipal system should arrange streets and squares, avoid potholes, install comfortable street furniture, improve appearance, and thus make these places accessible and comfortable for the long-term stay of older adults. It is expected that a targeted design of street furniture can produce opportunities for social gatherings. When remodeling the physical environment, it is important to take older adults’ preferences into account and potentially, their preference for “old looking environments.” Given the limited presence of younger people in the open spaces examined in this study and the finding that individuals of different age groups engage in different activities, it is possible that different age groups have different requirements or preferences for the physical environment. Hence, the design of spaces that cater to all ages may not be feasible.The World Health Organization has promoted the idea of age friendly cities; cities which cater to individuals of all ages (the ). Our findings, however, indicate that older adults engage in different kinds of activities from younger adults. Moreover, old and young seem to have very little spontaneous interaction in these open spaces, other than in the roles of care recipients and carers. Our findings suggest that a multi-generational presence within a single setting is not enough to establish contact. Hence, this study stresses the potential importance of attitude change to facilitate social interaction between people of different age groups. “Aging in place” is defined as “individuals growing old in their own homes, with an emphasis on using environmental modifications to compensate for limitations and disabilities” (, p. 2). The present research is important for understanding hidden physical and social aspects of aging in place. The study has shown the ways in which older adults make an effort on their own, without the guidance of an institution or formal sources, to keep their presence in the urban environment and stay part of the social fabric. Our findings are consistent with past research, which has shown that older adults are interested in being part of the social fabric (). The findings support the need for mixed-use development that offers pedestrian connection and blends residential, recreational, and commercial areas. This is particularly essential for older adults, who use the “surveillance zone” as an opportunity to extend their social life beyond their home. With growing physical impairment, older adults become dependent on mixed-use spaces to maintain their social involvement with the outside world. This claim has been supported by  that have argued that special attention should be paid to older adults with functional limitations who appear to be more vulnerable to environmental hurdles.Another important implication of the present study stems from the gender division identified. The study suggests a clear tendency towards gender homogenous activities. This could reflect a preference towards gender homogenous interactions or a differential preference of social activities among men and women. Whereas men are more likely to engage in pre-planned structured activities, women are more likely to engage in unstructured conversations. Hence, the study suggests that both age and gender preferences and needs should be taken into account in city planning. Specifically, city planners should design sitting areas that allow for conversations as well as settings that promote structured card games or other structured activities.It is important to stress that the city in which the study was conducted is characterized by a substantial welfare support for older adults. Within a close distance from the two sites, there are an elderly social club, an adult day care center, and community centers, all potentially available to older adults. Yet, our study clearly demonstrates that many older adults prefer to engage informally in their nearby surroundings. This informal gathering could serve as an opportunity to reach out to older adults, who are not necessarily recognized by authorities. It is important to note, however, that they may or may not be interested in establishing formal relationships with authorities.Despite its notable strengths, this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. The analysis was conducted based on the researchers’ personal impressions, relying on a subjective categorization of activities and social scenes. Although we were deductively inspired by past theories and research in the field of environmental gerontology (; ; ), we attempted to ensure that our coding system was inductively developed. This tension between inductive and deductive reasoning is expected given the relative unexplored nature of the topic area, yet, it poses a challenge, which has to be explicitly acknowledged. To strengthen the trustworthiness of our approach, we relied on independent raters for coding purposes.The findings reveal only the observed layers of outdoor occurrences and we cannot present detailed information about participants’ characteristics or inner thoughts and feelings. Further research could uncover a deeper layer regarding the motives for staying outdoors and identify the deeper meanings that older adults are creating in these spaces. The integration of observational data with interview data can be particularly valuable with regard to loneliness as it stresses the distinction between objective and subjective perceptions of social encounters.Finally, it is important to note that the present study was conducted in Israel, a country that is characterized by mild weather conditions. Hence, people are quite accustomed to spending their time in the outdoor environment. Possibly, countries that have more extreme weather conditions are characterized by different patterns of behaviors of older adults. Despite its limitations, this study provides a unique perspective on the observed activities of older adults in public open spaces. It stresses the importance of the “surveillance zone” in their lives and the social roles that it plays. FundingNone declared. Conflict of InterestNone declared. References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesAlthough the role of place on health is not new, less is known about how place matters for cognition. By investigating both neighborhood and home as the sociospatial realms of older adults, we explore associations between health and place across multiple contexts. We also distinguish objective and subjective measures of place and disentangle their differential associations with cognition.Research Design and MethodsWe analyzed place effects on cognition from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 2,260) linked to neighborhood characteristics and crime data. We measured place in four ways: (a) objective indicators of neighborhood such as police-reported crime rates and interviewer-reported on presence of disordered conditions on the streets; (b) perceptions of neighborhood by respondents (perceived danger and social cohesion); (c) objective conditions of home (interviewer’s report on presence of clutters, odor, and messiness); (4) perceived social support, strain, and threat by household members. The MoCA-SA was used to assess cognitive functioning.ResultsSubjective interpretations appeared to have more direct effects on cognition than did objective indicators of neighborhood or home. When examining these living environments together, we found the association between neighborhood and cognition is partially explained by characteristics of home environment, especially perceived social support. We found a buffering effect of social support on cognition for women, not for men.Discussion and ImplicationsLate life living environments are important contexts for aging. Aging-in-Place interventions should address subjective interpretations of place to reduce future risks of cognitive decline. , , , Late life living environments are important contexts for aging because they can shape social opportunities, promote health and enhance competency, or create social strains and stress and increase risks of illness for older adults. A large body of prior work has examined whether and how place matters for successful aging of older adults. Communities, neighborhood, and home environment all have been linked to health and well-being from functioning to morbidity to mortality.Despite prior work linking place to various health outcomes, the effects of place on cognitive functioning have been relatively ignored. Yet, there are theoretical reasons to believe context matters for cognition in later life based on research in younger adults () and animal studies (). Specifically, exposure to a socially enriched environment appears to confer cognitive benefits by stimulating learning, diversifying social resources, and increasing opportunities for social activities (). Exposure to a stressful environment may affect neurogenesis (), which plays a key role in memory function, providing a potential mechanism through which place may affect cognition. Given the effects of exercise on brain function in animal studies (), dangerous structural conditions of the neighborhood may influence cognition if people living in these environments are less likely to use outdoor space for physical activities.The literature on the effects of place on cognition in later life has focused almost exclusively on characteristics of objective neighborhood context such as crime, access to amenities, and built environment (; ; ). Virtually no attention has been paid to the household, although most of the time of older adults is spent in their home (). Despite the contribution of earlier work linking place to cognition, very little research has explicitly examined the association between subjective interpretations of place and cognitive functioning. Because objective neighborhood context and neighborhood perceptions are linked yet distinct constructs, it is important to distinguish their differential impacts on cognition.In this study, we begin to fill the gap in our knowledge of the role of characteristics of the neighborhood and the home environment as late life living environments. We seek to investigate the mechanisms through which place—neighborhood and home both separate and together—acts on cognition and assess the extent to which objective and subjective measures of place reinforce, complement, or conflict with each other. BackgroundAging in Context: Neighborhood and Home EnvironmentsA number of studies have now shown that features of place are important predictors of health among the elderly adults. The Disability model by  outlines the ways that individuals interact with their environments and stresses the importance of the environment in determining the well-being of older adults. Research on the built environment illustrates the effect of decay, such as vandalism and poorly maintained streets, on older adults’ physical activity; living in these kinds of neighborhoods has been associated with greater functional limitations that impair mobility, which may, in turn, lead to limited social interaction (; ). Evidence based on Sampson and colleagues’ concept of concentrated disadvantage (), as well as social disorganization theory (), suggests that concentrated disadvantage (e.g., a combination of high poverty rates, high crime, high minority composition, low socioeconomic status in residential areas) affects the health and well-being of older adults through daily worries about danger in that neighborhood. This prior work emphasizes that living in disordered neighborhoods may affect health through its impact on increased feelings of vulnerability and discomfort that may in turn influence social resources and opportunities.In addition to neighborhood, others have argued physical conditions of the home environment (e.g., presence of clutter, mess, and disrepair) as another key context that influences health. Although overlooked in the literature of aging in place, a few studies argued that the home environment should be addressed because it may have more direct effects on health due to its proximity to daily lives (). The typical empirical approach to the home environment and health relationship has focused on the impact of the social environment at home, as indexed by absent social support or household composition (; ). However, a recent paper by  showed that those living in cluttered homes faced higher risks of disability, highlighting the importance of considering the physical environment at home as a potential contributor to health. Similarly,  indicated that living in homes with hazards such as poor lighting, clutter, and uneven floors may influence the risk of falling injuries. Although there has been strong evidence on the beneficial effects of social integration on cognition (for a review, see ), we understand little about the effect of the physical characteristics of the home on cognition. This paper begins to fill this gap. Collective Measurements of Place: Integrating Objective and Subjective Measures in Neighborhood Together with the Home EnvironmentAlthough a large volume of research examines the role of the structural conditions of place on health, less attention has been paid to the mechanisms through which perceptions of place affect health. Most existing research fails to distinguish objective environmental indicators, such as police-reported crime rates from respondents’ subjective interpretations of those crime statistics through their fear of crime. In fact, these measures have been used interchangeably as proxies for environmental disorder. Evidence suggests, however, that perceptions of one’s neighborhood matter for health. For example,  found that perceptions of neighborhoods have more direct effects on health than objective indicators themselves.  showed that neighborhood violent crime is associated with depressive symptoms through perceptions of neighborhood disorder and previous experiences of violence. Despite ready evidence of the link between health and place (especially neighborhood environment), little research has evaluated the relative implications for cognition of the objective environment and subjective perceptions of place. Simultaneous examination of both objective and subjective measures is needed to advance our knowledge about how place affects cognition.In addition, previous studies promoting “aging in place” have largely examined place at one level and overlooked the intersection of neighborhood and home and their separate and interdependent influences on health. Changes common during aging, such as retirement, mobility challenges, and loss of confidants, often leave older adults more spatially confined to and reliant on their neighborhood and especially home than younger people (). There are, however, relatively a few studies considering both neighborhood and residence as nested contexts that encompass older adults’ daily life activities and experiences. Instead, prior work tended to account for household characteristics merely as covariates when neighborhood was considered as the key proximal environment. Only a few recent studies have examined the independent effects of both contexts (neighborhood and home) on later life health outcomes including functional decline () and psychological distress (). Because disordered conditions on the street may be a mechanism that results in disorder in the home (), the authors argued that both home and neighborhood should be considered as a “layered context.” Despite their findings about neighborhood effects of health through confines of the home, no study to date has examined the links between characteristics of place and cognition. Conceptual Framework presents our conceptual framework of the links between place and cognition. As seen in , we consider both neighborhoods and homes as the sociospatial realms that act as environmental stimuli that affect cognition through their influences on social resources and opportunities. Incorporating insights from research that illustrates the role of perceived social isolation (i.e., loneliness) on one’s cognitive capacity (), we argue that social disintegration or isolation generated by pronounced levels of disordered conditions in living environments may be a key mechanism consequential for cognitive functioning.  explain that social isolation might lead to elevations in inflammatory responses in the brain, reductions in social stimulation, and decreases in cognitive resources, the result of which may lead to cognitive impairment. In each neighborhood and home environment, we distinguish objective indicators of these characteristics from those perceived by each older person. Following prior work (), we consider the disordered conditions of place as rated by trained observers as objective indicators. Social context of place characterized by social relations in it was considered as subjective measures of place (detailed in ). We hypothesize that the neighborhood and home environments are independently associated with cognition (hypothesis 1). We also hypothesize that, within each context, objective measures may affect cognition through subjective perceptions (hypothesis 2) and that cognitive functioning may be more strongly affected by the home environment, the more proximal environment, than by neighborhood as the more distal environment (hypothesis 3).

Figure 2.Objective versus subjective measures of place.Figure 2.Objective versus subjective measures of place.This study overcomes the limitations of previous research in three ways: (a) the use of the integrated approach of aging in place—measured by both neighborhood and homes; (b) the assessment of cognition in context using a nationally representative sample; and (c) the investigation of the layered pathway of perceived characteristics as potential mechanisms for the effect of objective measures of place on cognition (both in neighborhood and home). MethodsStudy SampleWe used the second wave of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) collected in 2010 and 2011. NSHAP is a nationally representative survey of community-dwelling older adults in the United States born between 1920 and 1947 (aged 57–85 at the time of the Wave 1 interview collected in 2005 and 2006). The NSHAP data include individual demographic factors as well as a wide variety of health outcomes. One useful feature of these data is that they also include an array of social dimensions of aging in various environments, measured both by respondents and field interviewers. This allows for a more developed analysis of how context shapes social life and affects health outcomes in later life. Detailed information on the study objectives and design have been published elsewhere ().We merged NSHAP Wave 2 with the FBI Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and the 2006–2009 American Community Survey (ACS) to obtain census-tract level geocoded information on crime and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. The full sample of respondents available in NSHAP W2 was 2,260. MeasuresDependent Variable—Cognitive Function (MoCA-SA)Cognitive function was measured using the MoCA-SA (). This measure is based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a screening tool developed for clinical settings to distinguish mild cognitive impairment and early dementia from normal cognitive function (). This measure was adapted after extensive testing for administration by nonmedically trained personnel (e.g., field interviewers) during an in-home, face-to-face interview. The 18 items of MoCA-SA are: (a) Orientation: date and month (2 points total); (b) Executive function: abstraction—similarity of watch and ruler (1 point), modified Trails-b (1 point); (c) Visuospatial skills: clock—contour, numbers, and hands (3 points total); (d) Memory: 5-word delayed recall (5 points); (e) Attention: forward digits (1 point), backward digits (1 point), subtract 7 s (3 points); and (f) Language: naming rhinoceros (1 point), phonemic fluency—words with the letter “F” (1 point for > 10 words in 60 s), and sentence repetition (1 point) (e.g., see  and  for more detailed information on this measure). MoCA-SA scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognition. Independent Variables—Objective Versus Subjective Measures of PlaceAs presented in , two domains of disordered environments were investigated: neighborhood and home. In each domain, we constructed objective and subjective measures that identify unique features of structure and social–dynamic aspects of the living space.Objective measures of neighborhood included four indexes: (a) violent crime from FBI UCR; (b) neighborhood disadvantage index from ACS; (c) neighborhood physical disorder index; and (d) built environment (street disrepair). Both crime and the disadvantage index were measured at census-tract level. We constructed a composite variable of violent crime that includes murder, sexual assault, rape, and robbery crime indexes. We constructed the neighborhood disadvantage measure by standardizing and summing the following items: (a) percent poverty; (b) percent educational attainment (less than high school); (c) percent unemployed; (d) percent female-headed household; and (e) percent of households receiving public assistance. To construct a scale of neighborhood physical disorder, we used five items assessed by NSHAP interviewers that capture the extent of problems or disorder on the street (one block, both sides) on which respondents lives, including presence of dirtiness, noise, heavy traffic, density, and odor/pollution. Following previous work (), we combined these five items as a marker of neighborhood problems. Interviewers also described the extent of disrepair of the buildings on the respondent’s block face.Subjective measures of neighborhood consisted of three indexes: (a) neighborhood danger; (b) neighborhood social ties; and (c) neighborhood social cohesion. Each index was based on whether respondent perceived their local areas as dangerous, socially tight knit, and/or cohesive. Local areas in NSHAP Wave 2 were defined as “everywhere within a 20-minute walk or within about a mile of your home.”To construct objective measures of the home, we used the field interviewers’ evaluations of the physical conditions and ambiences of the respondent’s living space. To measure subjective measures of the home, we summed and averaged the respondent-reported items that captured the degree of perceived social support, strain, and threat by household members. Full text of all items used to construct the scales and summary statistics can be found in .

CovariatesBaseline demographic characteristics included age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and residential tenure. Age was included as a quadratic term as it shared a nonlinear relationship with cognitive function. Gender was coded as female (=1) with male as the reference group. Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as Non-Hispanic White (=reference group), Non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic, and Others. Educational attainment was measured with attended college or more (=1; otherwise=0). Because we believe that neighborhood effects may operate differently by length of residence, we controlled for residential tenure (“living in the same local areas” for 6 years or more=1; otherwise=0).In addition, several health conditions were controlled as covariates, including prior cognitive function, depressive symptoms, chronic disease burden, and self-reported physical health. Prior cognitive function was measured at Wave 1, while other measures were from Wave 2. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment and depression may affect how individuals perceive things around them (). We assessed cognition at Wave 1 using a 10-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) () because MoCA-SA was only introduced in Wave 2. Depressive symptoms were assessed in Wave 2, using an adaptation of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale minus loneliness (). For chronic disease burden, we controlled for the NSHAP comorbidity index that included 15 prevalent health conditions in older adults, detailed elsewhere (). Self-reported physical health was dichotomized into “Fair/Poor” (coded = 1) versus “Excellent/Very Good/Good.” Analytic AnalysisWe employed both additive and mediation analyses to assess the impact of contextual factors on cognition. Specifically, the additive model predicts that neighborhood and home environments each are associated with cognition. The mediation analysis assesses the extent to which perceptions (subjective measures) of each context explain the association between structural conditions (objective measures) and cognition.In Model 1, we included objective measures of neighborhood together with individual demographic characteristics and health conditions. In Model 2, we added subjective measures of neighborhood to test if perceptions explain the effect of objective measures on cognition. In Model 3, we switched gears and examined the independent effects of the home environment by fitting its objective measures such as messiness and ambience of respondent’s residence. In Model 4, we added subjective measures of the home environment as we did in Model 2. In Model 5, we added both objective and subjective measures of each context to test whether neighborhood characteristics retained an independent effect on cognition above and beyond the effects of the home environment and individual characteristics.We fit OLS linear regression models for MoCA-SA. NSHAP uses a multistage area probability design based on a nationally representative, population-based sample of older adults. In the current study, all analytical models were adjusted for design effects with survey weights employed (STATA 14). ResultsDescriptive statistics for variables used in this study, shown in , are weighted and adjusted for survey design. The mean of the MoCA-SA was 22.6, in the normal range but just slightly above the cutoff for mild cognitive impairment, which was 22 (). Respondents on average lived in neighborhoods with violent crime rates (98.02) slightly lower than the national level (100). They were on average likely to live in socioeconomically moderate neighborhood disadvantage level (the mean of each percentage fell around the median value, data not shown). They perceived their proximal environments as more cohesive and supportive than dangerous or threatening. Almost 60% of respondents attended college. Older adults appeared to choose to age in place. Only 15% of respondents moved over the 5-year period (between Wave 1 and Wave 2). shows results for multivariate models estimating the effects of place on cognition. We began by examining the models for neighborhood characteristics. Model 1 shows that individuals living in neighborhoods with poor built environment (street disrepair) have lower scores on the MoCA-SA than others (b = −0.42; p < .05). We see an inverse association between violent crime and cognition but there was a threshold effect such that only high levels of violent crime were associated with worse cognitive function (b = −0.39; p < .05). Neither neighborhood disadvantage nor presence of disorder on the street was associated with cognition. The addition of perceptions of neighborhood in Model 2 decreased the effect of street disrepair to −0.37 (p < .05) and also reduced the effect of violent crime to insignificance. For instance, we found that higher levels of perceived neighborhood danger were associated with lower cognitive function (b = −0.71; p < .05). Conversely, respondents living in neighborhoods that they perceive as cohesive (b = 0.33; p < .05) and socially tight knit have higher cognitive performance, although the latter effect is not statistically significant. Table 2.Multivariate Regressions Results of Objective and Subjective Measures of Place on Cognition Note: aCovariates include age, female, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, comorbidity at Wave 2, cognitive functioning at Wave 1, depressive symptoms at Wave 2, physical health at Wave 2, and residential tenure.*p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.Next, we tested the extent to which the home environment is independently associated with cognition. In Model 3, we found living in a cluttered home, was negatively associated with cognition (b = −0.49; p < .05) but a state of disrepair in residential buildings was not. In Model 4, the effect of ambient hazards in the home on cognition was eliminated when perceptions of social support, strain, and threat in the home environment were added. In Model 5, when examining both the neighborhood and home as living environments, we observed the unique importance of the home as the proximal context of late life living environments. For example, the addition of characteristics of the home environment eliminated the effect of street disrepair and reduced the effect of perceived danger on cognition. Although perceived social support appeared to worsen cognitive performance in Model 4 and 5, the addition of an interaction term between social support and gender in Model 6 confirmed that the effect of social support on cognition appears only for women (b = 0.65; p < .05), not for men (illustrated in ).Among covariates, non-White minorities, educational attainment less than college, higher levels of depressive symptoms, self-reported poor health, and lower levels of cognitive function at Wave 1 were associated with lower cognitive functioning at Wave 2. These associations were statistically consistent throughout the models (). We performed sensitivity analyses to test for the significance of the reduction in the coefficients in the mediation analyses (). We confirmed that the effects of objective indicators (street disrepair in Model 2 and home problems in Model 4) on cognition operate through subjective interpretations of place (perceived danger in Model 2 and social support in Model 4). We also confirmed that the effect of perceived danger on cognition operated through social support in Model 5. DiscussionHealthy cognition is critical for “successful aging” (). Cognitive function is closely related to maintenance of everyday competence and social dimensions of aging. Despite prior work linking place to health, cognition in context has been relatively ignored. Previous work on “aging in place” has largely focused one type of place and has overlooked the separate contexts of neighborhood and home and their distinct yet interdependent influences on cognition. Very little research has separated the effects of objective indicators from subjective interpretations of place, although some evidence suggests that features of structure on cognition may operate through their impacts on social–dynamic aspects of the living space. This study built on previous research by exploring the processes through which place affects cognition. We posit that an association between measures of place (objective and subjective) and cognitive functioning may be attributable to fewer opportunities for social contact and quality relationships that may arise because of limited mobility in disordered neighborhoods and households.Five main results have been obtained in our study. First, we found place matters for cognition as it does for other health outcomes examined in prior work. Second, the effect of objective indicators of place on cognition appeared to operate primarily through the effect of subjective interpretations of place. This corroborates prior work that argues that assessments of the effect of place, primarily measured by objective indicators, on health may paint an incomplete and misleading picture if perceptions of place are not taken into account (; ). Third, we observed the unique importance of the home as the proximal context of late life living environments. Conditions of neighborhood and home independently influenced cognition. Fourth, accounting for conditions of the home environment partially explained the adverse effect of neighborhood disorder (perceived danger) on cognition. This suggests that characteristics of the home environment may be a mechanism through which conditions of neighborhood affect cognition. Fifth, the influence of perceived social support on cognitive functioning is to some extent different between men and women. Social support was protective in women but not in men.What mechanisms might link characteristics of place to cognition? First, place could act on cognition through psychosocial pathways. Living in a place that residents perceive as stressful or dangerous may increase feelings of fear and vulnerability that lead older people to withdraw from public space. Social isolation accompanied by withdrawal from public space may lead to increased feelings of loneliness, which has a negative impact on cognitive stimulation (). Decrease in use of public space may also lead people to engage in sedentary activities. Less engagement in physical activities may increase risk of obesity and hypertension, both of which have been linked to cognitive impairment (). Second, physiological mechanisms through which stress affects the brain may be a pathway through which stress-inducing place matters for cognition. For example,  emphasized that stress may favor neurodegenerative processes, which crucially influences memory function. Third, Attention Restoration Theory (ART) (; ) may provide a potential explanation for why exposure to disordered environments has a detrimental effect on cognitive functioning. According to this theory, processing of visual disorder (i.e., clutters, decay, traffic) in the brain may overload cognitive capacity by thinking how to protect from the disorder (i.e., to avoid being hit by a car), which may in turn fatigue cognitive resources and subsequently affect attention function. Fourth, cognitive reserve models could also account for how socially supportive places affect cognition. The cognitive reserve model is often used to explain how aspects of life such as education may protect against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease by increasing skills or repertoires of coping strategies that conserve cognition (). Building on this model, one may expect that active participation in social activities may benefit cognition in large part through high levels of social contacts and integration that demand more attention and produce continued mental stimulation, thereby delaying onset of cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that living environments perceived as socially competent with a sense of “livable” community may serve as cognitively stimulating environment.One key finding in this study is gender differences in conditioning the role of social support on cognition. The possible explanation is that women and men experience different amount of social relations and perceive social life differently. In lieu of reciprocity in social relationships, married women may give more whereas men receive more social support (). Accordingly, the amount of support that married men receive may reduce their need to manage their social relationships and support when women give so much support. Inclination to unequal social relations may lead to “disuse” of social activities, which may result in “atrophy” of cognitive skills and processes. According to the concept of “use it or lose it” (), once the atrophy point has been reached, the brain experiences less stimulation, which may lead to increased risk of poor cognitive performance and neurodegenerative disease.One of the strengths of this study is that we extend the concept of sociospatial realms of older adults. This decision was informed by insights from the study of “activity space,” where activity space is defined as the collection of “those places and spaces in which one engages in routine activities” (). Building on disablement models that identify physical conditions of the home environment as an important context for later life functioning (), we elected to assess neighborhood together with home environment as later life immediate environments. Our finding—the independent effects of neighborhood and home on cognition—clarifies possible sources of contextual risks in cognition. Another strength is that we observed that conditions of place—objective versus subjective—in which health takes shape are interdependent or confluent. Although our findings are in agreement with previous reports that results might be biased without distinguishing objective from perceived factors of neighborhood (; ), no study examines the association in the context of home. To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first large, population-based studies assessing both objective and subjective measures of place and disentangling their differential impacts on cognition.Our study has several limitations. First, though environmental disorder is often presumed to elicit stress and to trigger its various manifestations, aspects of place may also respond to an individual’s health. Longitudinal study design will allow testing reverse causality or bidirectionality. Second, cognitive function was measured differently in each wave. Because we believe that poor cognition affects the ways in which people perceive and respond to surroundings, we elected to control for prior cognition measured in Wave 1. Third, the study was cross-sectional; causal pathways cannot be determined. Fourth, given that the primary sampling unit of NSHAP is the metropolitan/county level, multilevel modeling was not feasible due to insufficient clustering at the tract level.We conclude that place indeed matters for cognition. We provide evidence that regular upkeep of the immediate living environments has beneficial effects of maintaining cognitive function in later life. Our findings suggest that context-specific assessments may foster the early identification and facilitate treatment of cognitive health problems. Further, targeting older people living in poorly built environments with presence of residential hazards may be a key component of promoting aging autonomously in context. Promoting leisure activities such as volunteering and civic engagement may be beneficial for those in such vulnerable context because it may dampen the effects of environmental stress on social behaviors and subsequently cognition.

References Issue Section:Supplementary data - docx file, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesContextual contributors to sleep problems are important to examine among older adults because sleep problems are associated with a number of adverse outcomes in late life. We examine whether disordered neighborhoods are a key contextual determinant of sleep problems in late life, as well as how subjective social power—a sense of personal control and subjective social status—mediates and moderates this association. Central to this contribution is the use of econometric techniques that holistically control for time-stable factors that may bias estimated associations.Research Design and MethodsThree waves (2006, 2010, 2014) of the psychosocial subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,130) are analyzed with random-effects models that adjust for repeated observations, as well as fixed-effects models that additionally control for all time-stable confounders.ResultsNeighborhood disorder is associated with greater sleep problems in random-effects models, but this association is substantially weakened in a fixed-effects model. Personal control mediates this association, but does not moderate it. Subjective social status does not mediate the association, but does moderate it.Discussion and ImplicationsAlthough neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in older adults, this association is likely to be overestimated in analyses that do not compressively control for time-stable confounders. Rather than acting as dual mediators and moderators, perceived control and subjective social status play distinct roles in this association, with seniors at lower levels of subjective social status especially at risk for sleep problems due to neighborhood disorder. , , , , Contributors to sleep problems are important to examine among older adults because sleep problems are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in late life, such as decreased cognitive and functional abilities, reduced quality of life, and mortality (). Research also suggests that sleep quality is a central consequence of social disadvantages (). Residence in a neighborhood with a high degree of disorder is often a critical component of social disadvantage because disordered neighborhoods are living environments beset with breakdowns in the maintenance of peace and safety through social control (). The breakdown in peace and order is indicated by physical signs, such as broken windows, as well as social signs, such as threatening neighbors (). Sleep problems may therefore be a key means through which contextual disadvantage “gets under the skin” to influence health in older adults ().Previous studies appear to confirm that neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems in older adults (e.g., ; ). Yet, as we describe in the literature review, there are a broad number of time-stable factors that previous research has not taken into account which may inflate this association. Although previous research therefore suggests that neighborhood disorder is a determinant of sleep problems in older adults, this is still very much an open question. Furthermore, beyond simply specifying an association, identifying the means by which neighborhood conditions influence older adults is crucial because delineating these processes “could contribute to the development of more targeted clinical and public health interventions” (, p. 114). In particular, previous research indicates that psychosocial perceptions of power are key to explaining the consequences of neighborhood disorder (), suggesting that these perceptions may play a central role in association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems.This research therefore addresses two focal questions. First, using a national longitudinal study of older adults, we examine whether the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems in older adults remains when all time-stable sources of spuriousness are holistically controlled. Second, we examine whether subjective social power—as indicated by a sense of personal control and subjective social status (SSS)—mediates and moderates this association. Mediation occurs when neighborhood depletes a resource, which in turn leads to an increase in sleep problems; moderation occurs when the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is weaker at higher levels of the resource (). Specifying mediators and moderators of this association may therefore not only help explain how neighborhood disorder “gets under the skin” to influence well-being in older adults but also identify social-psychological mechanisms that could be targeted for interventions to prevent or weaken the effects of neighborhood disorder sleep problems in late life. Time-Stable Sources of SpuriousnessDespite research supporting the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems in older adults, there is a large breadth of time-stable factors that may positively bias this association and have not been fully addressed in prior research. One substantial source of these confounding factors emerges from common method variance (CMV), which is systematic error that can occur due to using the same source for predictors and outcomes (). Previous research has often asked individuals to characterize both the condition of their neighborhoods and their sleep quality, yet personal characteristics that are likely to be relatively stable in late life, such as response styles and personality traits, may bias associations between self-report measures (). In particular, these personal factors may lead to tendencies to agree or disagree across sets of questions, leading to high method correlation can inflate the association between observed measures (; ). The threat posed by CMV is illustrated by a meta-analysis suggesting that over a quarter of observed associations may be due to shared method variance (). One remedy for addressing CMV is through the use of multivariate methods that include a robust set of covariates that are indicative of CMV (). Moreover, because the sources of strong method correlation are often based on time-stable personal factors, multivariate methods that comprehensively account for time-stable sources of spurious covariation will also address the most prevalent sources of method correlation.Time-stable influences may also confound the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems because residence in disordered neighborhoods is often the result of a number of social disadvantages (), and disadvantages accrued throughout the life course are also associated with greater sleep problems (e.g., ). Critically, a wide array of disadvantages that place individuals into poor neighborhoods and affect sleep problems can accumulate over time because hardships experienced early in the life course tend to lead to additional hardships (). To take just one example, childhood adversities are associated with exposure to additional adversities in adulthood that are in turn associated with both placement in disordered neighborhoods and sleep problems (; ; ). Consequently, the set of adversities that may amass throughout individuals’ lives to place people into disordered neighborhoods and affect sleep is quite broad, with the result that it is unlikely that statistical models can account for these confounders through observed measures alone. Alternatively, econometric approaches have been designed to holistically control for time-stable confounders, even when these time-stable factors are not directly observed (). In the current study, we therefore present an important advance in research on neighborhood disorder and sleep problems in older adults by using econometric techniques to holistically control for life-course confounders and time-stable response biases in examining this association. Mediation by Subjective Social PowerPrevious research emphasizes that perceptions of power and powerlessness often play a key role in mediating and moderating the consequences of neighborhood disorder (). More recent research argues that these subject appraisals in part constitute a broad construct of “subjective social power” (). Subjective social power characterizes the dual nature of power in relation to self and others through the combination of sense of personal control and SSS. Perceived control is a self-focused component of subjective social power by referring to one’s own abilities to acquire desired ends and avoid unwanted outcomes (). In contrast, SSS refers to individuals’ subjective evaluations of how they rank when compared to others in terms of key components of power and prestige (). SSS is essentially a combination of contemporaneous markers of social position, including access to resources that extend beyond conventional status measures (). Although a sense of control therefore indicates perceived individual abilities to affect desired ends, SSS is inherently comparative by indicating one’s sense of relative standing in structures of power and attribution of resources. As we describe below, there is theoretical justification to expect that each component of subjective social power will both mediate and moderate the consequences of neighborhood disorder.Neighborhood disorder is likely to reduce both a sense of control and SSS, and reductions in both perceived control and SSS are in turn likely to increase sleep problems, which would constitute a mediating process. Neighborhood disorder tends to reduce a sense of control because disordered neighborhoods project a sense of randomness in the environment, which in turn decreases the sense that one’s environment can be controlled (). Moreover, the key signs of neighborhood disorder—such as crime, vandalism, and a sense of threat—inherently attack a sense of personal control because “residents often feel powerless to achieve a goal most people desire—to live in a clean, safe environment free from threat, harassment, and danger” (, p. 290). Believing that we cannot control what happens in our lives in turn can evoke anxiety and other emotions that may disturb sleep (). Similarly, individuals with low levels of perceived control are more liable for rumination and self-doubt, and these preoccupations can have a negative impact on sleep quality (; ).Neighborhood disorder may also reduce SSS. Contextual effects on SSS are emphasized by arguments that “Subjective social status might help account for the effect of the larger community on a person’s life” (, p. 698). Community conditions such as neighborhood disorder are likely to diminish SSS because signs of disorder in the environment implicitly communicate that residents occupy a lower relative social station by demonstrating “that the local agents of social control are either unable or unwilling to cope with local problems, and that those in power have abandoned them” (, p. 571). Moreover, continued residence within a community experiencing increasing disorder is often a marker of lower social standing (). Lower SSS is in turn associated with greater risk of sleep problems, with explanations for this association focusing on the stress incurred by low SSS, as well as worry and rumination over financial security (; ). Moderation by Subjective Social PowerGreater levels of both components of subjective social power are also likely to weaken the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems in older adults, which would constitute a moderating process. A strong sense of perceived control tends to spur active coping efforts (), as well as salubrious health behaviors that may help reduce sleep problems, such as exercise (). In addition, a strong sense of control tends to lead individuals to see a stressor as more limited in scope, leading it to have less pervasive effects (). This argument is supported by research showing that a sense of control tends to weaken the consequences of neighborhood disorder ().SSS may also weaken the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems, in part because the resources reflected by SSS tend to encourage active coping (). In addition, because SSS indicates assessments of access to a wide variety of resources (), individuals at high levels of SSS are likely to see the problems posed by the disordered neighborhood context as less threatening and more manageable (). As a result, for individuals with high SSS, neighborhood disorder is less likely to result in tension and anxiety that will lead to sleep problems. The importance of SSS for reducing the consequences of stressors is supported by research showing that SSS is inversely associated with biological markers of stress responses (), even when additional indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) are controlled (). Design and MethodsDataThis study utilizes data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is an ongoing longitudinal study of adults over age 50. Sampling was conducted through a multistage probability design, with oversampling of African Americans, Hispanics, and residents of Florida. Sampling weights are used to account for differential probabilities of selection and response, and information on clustering and sampling design is utilized in analyses for appropriate variance estimation. In 2006, a psychosocial and lifestyle questionnaire was added to the HRS, with half of the core HRS respondents receiving the questionnaire in 2006 and the second half receiving the questionnaire in 2008. The sleep problems measures were not asked in 2008, and we therefore only examine the 2006 subsample. The 2006 subsample was follow-up in 2010 and 2014, for three waves of observations. The overall response rate for the combination of the HRS and psychosocial questionnaire in 2006 was about 74%. There were 7,236 respondents with valid values for the psychosocial subsample survey weight in 2006. One hundred and six respondents were subsequently dropped from analyses due to the use of proxy responses, producing an overall sample size of 7,130. Respondent retention based on valid responses to the sleep problems scale was 84% in the 2010 wave and 71.5% in the 2014 wave. Analytic approaches that address sample attrition and item nonresponse are addressed below. Focal MeasuresSleep ProblemsThe sleep problems scale is based on four major indicators of sleep quality and has previously been used in research on older adults (e.g., ). Each of the questions is listed in . A principal axis factor analysis performed on a polychoric correlation matrix of the responses at each wave indicated only one factor with an eigenvalue greater than 1 at each wave, with the subsequent factor’s eigenvalue less than 0.16. The alpha coefficients across waves indicated suitable reliability (0.63–0.65). All responses were coded so that higher values indicated greater sleep problems, and the mean of the items was used as the measure of sleep problems. Table 1.Focal Measures aResponses range from 1 (most of the time) to 3 (rarely or never); all responses coded to indicate greater sleep problems. bThe opposing statements encapsulated a seven-item scale, and higher values indicate greater agreement with the high-disorder statement. cResponses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree); all responses coded to indicate greater perceived control. dResponses range from 1 to 10, corresponding to the 10 rungs on the ladder. Neighborhood DisorderThe neighborhood disorder scale is based on five sets of two opposing statements. Each of these statements is listed in . For each set of opposing statements, respondents indicated which was more typical of their “local area.” The local area was defined as “everywhere within a 20 minute walk or about a mile of your home.” The statements addressed physical disorder, such as vandalism, as well as social disorder, such as fear of walking in the dark. To address whether the social disorder items indicated neighborhood cohesion rather than neighborhood disorder, a principal axis factor analysis was performed on a polychoric correlation matrix of the five items at each wave. These analyses indicated only one factor with an eigenvalue greater than 1, with the next factor less than 0.5, at each wave. When one factor was extracted, all items loaded at 0.55 or greater at each wave. Notably, the trust item consistently loaded similarly to physical disorder items, suggesting that this item reflected the disorder construct. Reliability of the scale was also sufficient, with an alpha of 0.68 in 2006, 0.87 in wave 2010, and 0.88 in 2014. These analyses therefore supported using this set of items as one measure of disorder, with the mean of responses used to indicate neighborhood disorder. Perceived ControlThe measure of perceived control contains two subscales—powerlessness and individual mastery (). Five items describe powerlessness and five items describe individual mastery. Each of these items is listed in . Methodological research indicates that perceived control is a unidimensional construct, and response biases cause perceived control measures to break into these two subscales; consequently, combining responses to powerlessness and mastery helps address these biases (). Perceived control is therefore measured using the mean of the ten items, with Cronbach’s alpha approximately 0.88 at each wave. Subjective Social StatusSSS was measured using the MacArthur scale of Subjective Social Status. The exact wording of this question is presented in . For this question, respondents are presented with a ladder and asked to rank themselves in terms of their standing in society; as a result, higher values indicated greater self-assessed status. This measure has a high degree of convergent and discriminant validity (). CovariatesFundamental social statuses included as observed covariates were age, gender, race, SES, work status, and marital status. Age was measured by age in years at baseline, centered at 70. Gender was coded 0 = men, 1 = women. White older adults were compared to the categories of Black, Hispanic, and other race. SES was controlled using education and economic hardship. For education, less than a high school degree and high school degree was compared with greater than a high school degree. Because residence in disordered neighborhoods is likely to covary with individual circumstances of economic hardship, a time-varying poverty indicator (in which 1 = in poverty) is included that compares income to year-specific U.S. Census thresholds while also taking into account the number of resident family members and household members who are institutionalized, number less than age 18, and age of household head. Personal experiences with hardship were indicated by a commonly used time-varying measure—difficulty paying bills—with none/not very difficult compared to some difficulty and very/complete difficulty. To control for whether one had a source of income through work, individuals reported at each wave whether they were currently employed (coded as 1 = working). Marital status was measured based on a set of dichotomous variables—divorced, widowed, and never married—with the married as reference.Models adjust for whether the respondent moved in the previous 2 years with a dichotomous variable (1 = moved in previous 2 years) in order to control for self-selection out of disordered neighborhoods or into more orderly neighborhoods, as well as the stress of moving to a new location. Because perceptions of neighborhoods may be influenced by physical abilities to navigate the neighborhood (), and functional limitations may also affect sleep quality, functional limitations were controlled using a 10-item index (). Furthermore, because the degree to which one is active in the neighborhood may also affect both perceptions of the neighborhood and sleep quality, physical activity was controlled using two questions: How often respondents took part in vigorous activities, such as jogging or swimming, and how often respondents took part in moderately demanding activities, such as gardening or walking at a moderate pace. Responses were combined based on previous recommendations (), and the natural log of this measure is used to reflect greater benefit of increasing exercise from a sedentary level versus from a moderate level. Descriptives for all study variables are presented in . Table 2.Study Descriptives Note: SSS = subjective social status. N = 7,130. Descriptives are weighted and calculated through full-information maximum likelihood estimation. Methods of AnalysisAnalyses are carried out using random- and fixed-effects models, based on methods described in . A random-effects model is analogous to a conventional ordinary least squares regression, except that the model adjusts standard errors for repeated observations. The random-effects model therefore depends on observed covariates to rule out spuriousness. A fixed-effects model controls for all time-stable sources of confounding, though, even if these confounders are not directly observed. Comparing random- and fixed-effects models therefore illustrates whether observed controls do not sufficiently eliminate spuriousness. We estimate the random- and fixed-effects models for sleep problems by using the outcome at each wave as a set of indicators for a latent variable, with the latent variable measuring all unobserved time-stable influences on sleep problems. Random-effects model coefficients are estimated when this latent variable is not allowed to covary with the time-varying predictors, whereas fixed-effects model coefficients result when this latent variable is allowed to covary with the time-varying predictors. Time-stable predictors are random-effects coefficients in all models because they cannot covary with the latent indicator due to being collinear with the latent estimate of time-stable influences. To account for serial correlation, errors at adjacent waves are allowed to correlate. Similar procedures are followed when influences on perceived control and SSS are examined. All analyses are based on a full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimator. FIML addresses missing data and attrition by utilizing all information that is available from each case, thereby avoiding biases due to listwise deletion and producing parameter estimates that are equivalent to those produced through multiple imputation (). Analyses are carried out using the -sem- command in Stata 14.1. Focal predictors are approximately mean-centered to enhance interpretability of statistical interactions. Results presents the predictors of sleep problems. Model 1 shows that there is a significant positive bivariate association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems in a random-effects model, indicating that greater neighborhood disorder is associated with higher levels of sleep problems. Model 2 shows that, when the vector of observed controls is included in the model, the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is reduced by a third, but remains significant at p < .001. If we were depending only on the observed controls, then, we would conclude that the focal association is relatively robust to tests of spuriousness. However, in Model 3, coefficients for time-varying predictors are based on a fixed-effects model; the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is substantially reduced from Model 2, by approximately 60%. This reduction indicates that the majority of the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is spurious due to unobserved time-stable confounders. Furthermore, although the remaining association with neighborhood disorder is significant (albeit at a decreased p < .05 threshold), supplementary analyses using baseline variances showed a standardized coefficient of approximately 0.02, indicating that the overall association is quite weak once time-stable sources of confounding are taken into account. Table 3.Neighborhood Disorder and Sleep Problems in Older Adults Note: SSS = subjective social status. Metric coefficients are presented. N = 7,130. Models 1–2 are random-effects model, whereas in Models 3–5, all time-varying coefficients are fixed-effects model coefficients.*p ≤ .05. **p ≤ .01. ***p ≤ .001 (two-tailed tests).The next stage of analyses examines whether SSS and perceived control mediate the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems. Based on , mediation is tested first by examining whether controlling for a potential mediator reduces the coefficient for the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems. If this coefficient is reduced, mediation is directly tested using a Sobel test. In this test, the indirect association is calculated by multiplying the coefficient for the association between neighborhood disorder and the mediator with the coefficient for the association between the mediator and the sleep problems; dividing this product by its standard error produces a test of the statistical significance of the indirect association. Although a Sobel test is not preferred in small or moderately sized samples because the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is not normally distributed, this issue does not arise in large samples ().Model 4 controls for SSS, with the coefficient for this predictor based on a fixed-effects model. Higher levels of SSS are significantly associated with lower levels of sleep problems. The association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is not appreciably changed when SSS is controlled, though, indicating no evidence of mediation.  helps explain why controlling for SSS does not appear to mediate this association. Model 1 of  presents a random-effects model of the association between neighborhood disorder and SSS that includes all observed covariates, and this model indicates that neighborhood disorder is significantly associated with lower levels of SSS. In Model 2, though, coefficients for time-varying predictors are based on a fixed-effects model. In this model, the association between neighborhood disorder and SSS is reduced more than 85% and is no longer significant. SSS therefore did not mediate the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems because neighborhood disorder was not significantly associated with SSS once all time-stable sources of confounding were holistically controlled. Table 4.Neighborhood Disorder and Subjective Social Power in Older Adults Note: SSS = subjective social status. Metric coefficients are presented. N = 7,130. Models 1 and 3 are random-effects models. In Models 2 and 4, all time-varying coefficients are fixed-effects model coefficients.*p ≤ .05. **p ≤ .01. ***p ≤ .001 (two-tailed tests).Model 5 of  adds perceived control as a fixed-effects predictor of sleep problems. Higher levels of perceived control are significantly associated with lower levels of sleep problems. Furthermore, the coefficient for neighborhood disorder is reduced approximately 14% from Model 3, and this association is no longer significant, suggesting that perceived control mediates this association.  presents additional evidence to support the role of perceived control as a mediator by examining the association between neighborhood disorder and perceived control. Model 3 shows that, when all observed covariates are included in a random-effects model, neighborhood disorder is significantly and inversely associated with perceived control. Model 4 presents coefficients for time-varying predictors based on a fixed-effects model, and although the association between neighborhood disorder and perceived control is reduced by approximately 50%, the relationship remains significant at p < .001. In addition, a Sobel test based on the fixed-effects coefficients produced an indirect path of 0.0012, with a significance of p < .01. Neighborhood disorder is associated with a reduced sense of control and that, in turn, mediates the association between neighborhood disorder and greater sleep problems in older adults.Although the prior analyses address mediation, they do not address the moderation.  addresses moderation by testing interactions between neighborhood disorder and the dimensions of subjective social power. These interactions were tested by multiplying the measure of neighborhood disorder by the potential moderator and including the product as an additional fixed-effects predictor. Model 1 tests an interaction between neighborhood disorder and SSS, and this interaction is significant, indicating that the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems differs by levels of SSS. Furthermore, the coefficient for this interaction is negative, indicating that neighborhood disorder has a weaker association with sleep problems as SSS increases. To illustrate this interaction,  plots the predicted values for sleep problems at high and low levels of disorder for high and low levels of SSS (approximately 1 SD less than the mean), using the baseline intercept for the constant and holding all other variables constant at their means (age was held constant at 70). This figure shows that neighborhood disorder is positively associated with sleep problems at low SSS (b = 0.0199, p < .01), but not high SSS (b = −.0004, p > .10). The difference in sleep problems is about 0.15 of a difference in the time-varying standard deviation of sleep problems, indicating a smaller but notable association for people at low levels of SSS. Model 2 tests an interaction between neighborhood disorder and perceived control, and the coefficient for the interaction is not significant. These analyses therefore show that perceived control mediates the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems, whereas SSS moderates it.

DiscussionAlthough neighborhood disorder appears to be robustly associated with sleep problems in older adults when observed confounders are taken into account, with time-stable confounders holistically controlled in fixed effect models, the overall association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems is relatively weak, albeit still significant. These findings suggest that previous studies on sleep problems and older adults (e.g., ) may have overestimated the effects of neighborhood disorder on sleep problems due to a broad array of time-stable confounders. These confounders likely include response biases implicit in self-reports. However, the risk of spuriousness due to time-stable confounding cannot be entirely eliminated through the use of more “objective” measures—such as aggregate indicators of neighborhood conditions, observer observations, or biological indicators of well-being—because the sources of spuriousness also include a diverse array of life-course factors that can place individuals into poor neighborhoods and also adversely affect well-being. Research examining how the neighborhood context influences older adults should more commonly use longitudinal data analysis and advanced modeling techniques or run the risk of substantially misestimating the consequences of the neighborhood.At the same time, the use of fixed-effects models in this research leads to a focus on intra-individual variability (). The fixed-effects models are therefore useful for indicating how exposure to neighborhood disorder is associated with sleep problems specifically over the period under study. In other words, these models reflect the consequences of exposure to neighborhood disorder specifically in late life. For example, if one wished to use a cross-sectional sample, these models are not useful for examining how pre-existing levels of neighborhood disorder at baseline are associated with established levels of sleep problems. At the same time, if researchers wish to examine associations with pre-established neighborhood conditions, they should also take caution that there is likely to be a large degree of spuriousness in these associations. In this case, methods better address spuriousness, such as an instrumental variable approach, may be more appropriate.This study also sought to understand whether two dimensions of subjective social power mediate and moderate the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep. Previous research indicates that perceptions of power tend to both mediate and moderate the consequences of neighborhood disorder (), suggesting that research should examine whether the components of subjective social power both mediate and moderate the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems. However, analyses showed that each component was involved in a different process, as SSS only moderated the association, whereas perceived control only mediated it. Studies examining how the neighborhood context affects well-being in older adults should therefore examine how multiple dimensions of subjective social power intercede in this association, or important mechanisms for these contextual effects may be missed. In addition, because different components of subjective social power played different roles in the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems, future research should more consistently examine whether and how each aspect of subjective social power may function differently in the consequences of neighborhood problems for older adults.More generally, the analyses showed that the neighborhood context functions in concert with SSS to adversely affect seniors who are most disadvantaged. Neighborhood disorder was not associated with sleep problems at high levels of SSS, but this association was stronger and significant at low levels of SSS. Consequently, sleep problems might explain how disordered neighborhoods “get under the skin” to affect health, but especially for elders who are doubly disadvantaged by a combination of poor neighborhood conditions and low social status. For intervention design, this information is especially important because it suggests that sleep problems may especially be important to examine as a risk factor for subsequent health issues among older adults who both live in poor neighborhoods and lack few socioeconomic resources. Efforts could also be made to ensure that clinicians are aware that the causes of seniors’ sleep problems encompass contextual influences, with the appropriate treatment extending beyond medication to possibly include social services as well.These analyses also show that perceived control mediates the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems. This pattern of findings suggests that by interceding in the loss of perceived control, the chain between neighborhood disorder, sleep problems, and adverse health outcomes could be weakened. Additional interventions could therefore aid seniors living in disordered neighborhood through activities that are designed to fortify individual sense of control. At the same time, because perceived control explained only 14% of the association between neighborhood disorder and sleep problems, it is likely that additional mediators exist as well. For example, analyses could seek to examine whether anxiety and emotional upset created by neighborhood disorder lead to sleep problems, especially because a sense of control may moderate these effects (). ConclusionThe neighborhood is a crucial context for older adults, in part because neighborhood disorder can lower sleep quality, which may in turn harm seniors’ well-being. The importance of sleep problems may also be overestimated if time-stable confounders are not adequately controlled, though. Furthermore, the impact of the disordered neighborhood context on sleep problems is particularly potent at lower levels of SSS. This research therefore indicates that older adults who are dually disadvantaged by residence in a disordered neighborhood and low SSS are especially at risk for health problems due to troubled sleep. References Issue Section:, AbstractBackground and ObjectivesThis study examines whether neighborhood and household disorder is associated with sexual interest among partnered seniors.Research Design and MethodsAnalyses use dyadic data from Wave 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults (2010–2011). Measures of environmental disorder were conducted by trained interviewers. Survey data were also linked to census tract information from the 2009 American Community Survey. We used actor–partner interdependence models to estimate the likelihood of reporting low sexual interest.ResultsThere was no observed association between neighborhood context (physical disorder or census tract socioeconomic disadvantage) and sexual interest, but husbands were more likely to report low sexual interest if they lived in more disorderly households. High marital quality protected against low sexual interest, but these evaluations did not mediate or moderate the putative effect of household disorder.Discussion and ImplicationsRegardless of the broader neighborhood context, helping older adults maintain an orderly home space may help sustain sexual functioning. Future research should consider how various features of the environment matter for additional aspects of late-life sexuality. , , , , ,  IntroductionDeep-seated cultural stereotypes tend to desexualize older people (), but current adults are enjoying longer, healthier lives as sexually active individuals than their preceding cohorts (). The maintenance of close, intimate relationships is an essential component of overall quality of life and good health at older ages (; ), and a growing body of research suggests that regular sexual expression also enhances psychological and physical well-being in older adulthood (; ). Nevertheless, remaining sexually active in later life hinges in part on sexual interest, the “conscious thought about or interest in sexual activity” (, p. 925). Interest is in many ways a motivational “gatekeeper” for other sexual outcomes such as frequency of activity or satisfaction. By some estimates, around a quarter of older men and about 40–50% of older women experience low sexual interest ().The weight of the existing evidence reflects a predominantly biological or medical perspective to understanding sexual interest in later life. Research on the biological aspects of sexuality reveals that age-related physical and hormonal changes and/or chronic illnesses can substantially reduce or eliminate sexual desire (). Sometimes it is the side effects of medication responsible for these declines in sexual interest (; ). More recent models, particularly the biopsychosocial perspective, acknowledge the inadequacy of biomedical exclusivism; this broader approach recognizes that psychological factors (e.g., depression, personal attitudes) and social circumstances (e.g., availability of a partner, socioeconomic status) are as influential as—if not more important than—hormones or the vascular system (; ).Despite its contributions, the biopsychosocial model has been surprisingly silent as to how environmental conditions shape sexual outcomes in later life. This is a crucial omission for an integrative model of sexuality. Home and neighborhood are, after all, sociophysical spaces with fundamental implications for stress exposure (), the maintenance of close relationships and provision of social support (), and people’s sense of self ().What, then, can context also tell us about sex? Recognizing that “context” or “place” can take on many meanings in the literature (), this study focuses on the (dis)orderliness of immediate physical surroundings (neighborhood and home) and considers whether disorder portends lower sexual interest. Our approach is informed by research identifying environmental disorder as a common and consequential source of chronic stress (; ). By disorder, we refer to “observable features of decay or deterioration that convey a lack of social cohesion, support, and control in the residential environment” (, p.407). We use dyadic data from partnered older adults in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a survey which contains theoretically derived scales of neighborhood and household disorder empirically obtained from naturalistic observation (; ). Our focus on married or cohabiting heterosexual adults reflects the fact that late-life sexuality most often occurs in stable, marriage-like relationships, the vast majority of which include a man and woman (). Theoretical FrameworkThe Stress Process ModelOur analysis is guided by the stress process model, a framework highlighting the interlinkages between environmental disorder, psychosocial resources, and outcomes related to people’s well-being (). The model posits that stressors (e.g., environmental disorder) can directly undermine well-being. However, the effects of stressors can also be mitigated by key psychosocial resources (e.g., supportive or high-quality relationships), even as those very resources can be hampered by stressors and thereby undercut well-being. These latter processes are known, respectively, as the buffering and the psychosocial deterioration models of the stress process ().We depict disorderly home and neighborhood conditions as stressors, exposures that threaten older adults’ adaptive capacities, and can ultimately erode outcomes such as sexual interest. Consistent with the sociological stress perspective, sociospatial disorder is an unequally distributed stressor rooted in wide-scale structural problems such as poverty, racial exclusion, and disinvestment (; ). Prior research reveals that prolonged exposure to neighborhood disorder—poor lighting, disruptive noise, run-down buildings, and other signs of disarray—can indeed diminish a person’s sense of control (), increase psychological distress (), and heighten sense of threat (). Similar conclusions can be drawn from analyses linking disorderly household conditions (e.g., foul smell, clutter, poor home upkeep) with stress-related outcomes (). It is therefore reasonable to suppose that stress-inducing physical environments also take their toll on sexual interest. Indeed, men and women both report lower sexual interest when experiencing chronic stressors (; ).In considering two layers of the physical environment, it is worth noting that neighborhood and household may expose individuals to unique types of stress with different implications for sexual interest and for relevant psychosocial resources. First, the household environment is the more proximal context and may therefore represent a more chronic and direct form of stress exposure than the neighborhood. Although an individual may be able to temporarily escape the burdens of an unruly or disordered neighborhood, they do not have a similar option when it comes to their homes. Second, interior home spaces are more likely than neighborhood spaces to be the actual settings of sexual activity. An inhospitable bedroom would likely play a stronger role in dampening sexual desire than would a chaotic street corner, even if both contexts were capable of eliciting generic stress. Finally, much more so than the broader neighborhood, household (dis)order is jointly produced by several readily identifiable actors—namely, the coresidential dyad at the center of our analysis. If a partner is held at least partially responsible for the home’s state of disorder, this may undermine marital quality and illustrate an indirect pathway from environmental disorder to low sexual interest. On the other hand, maintaining a close marital relationship despite coexisting in an unappealing space could mitigate the negative effects of household disorder and operate as a moderating influence.These considerations lead us to suspect that the impact of the home environment will eclipse that of the neighborhood. Further, these considerations prompt us to consider marital quality as a potentially important psychosocial resource that could mediate or moderate the effects of contextual disorder, particularly with respect to the household. Recall that the psychosocial deterioration model of the stress process posits that stressors have a mediated effect on the outcome of interest due to their deleterious impact on an intervening psychosocial factor. Consistent with this argument, existing research indicates that seniors living in disordered households report lower quality family relationships than do seniors living in more orderly spaces (). Explanations for this finding include the irritation of spending time with family members in an unpleasant home and attributions of blame for poor upkeep. It is plausible that these processes apply also to marital relationships. Marital quality, in turn, has strong implications for sexual interest—in the words of , “[b]ecause sexual desire is most often directed toward another person, it is inextricably woven into the fabric of the relationship” (p.93). Indeed, high marital satisfaction is associated with greater sexual desire (), and negative relationship evaluations predict fewer sexual thoughts (). We could therefore envision lowered marital satisfaction as an intervening mechanism linking environmental disorder to low sexual interest.Alternatively, marital quality may buffer against the deleterious effects of contextual stress. Prior research finds that high-quality marriages can offset the effects of environmental disorder on older adults’ mental health (). Such relationships may, for example, reduce negative reactions to stress and enhance coping (). All told, the psychosocial buffering model implies that couples who maintain supportive, emotionally fulfilling relationships despite sharing disordered space will be the most likely to sustain high levels of sexual interest. Gender Differences?Does the stress of a disorderly environment have different implications for older men and women? Our use of couple-level data allows us to consider whether the proposed stress process unfolds identically or in gender-specific ways within the marital dyad. Drawing from interrelated gender theories, we have grounds for entertaining two distinctive possibilities. First, as many women internalize predominant cultural norms about gender, cleanliness, and home-making (; ), they may be more sensitive than men to environmental disequilibria and more emotionally disturbed by signs of disorder. This could leave older women’s sexual interest more vulnerable than men’s to the stress of household (and perhaps to a lesser degree, neighborhood) disorder. On the other hand, some research suggests that couples follow gendered sexual scripts such that one partner’s violation of traditional gender norms becomes a “turn-off” to the other (). Should men assign their wives the primary responsibility of home upkeep, they may be especially susceptible to low sexual interest when living amidst the gendered norm-violating stress of household disorder. This gender script account could also lead us to expect that household disorder is especially corrosive to men’s perceptions of marital quality. In any event, we apply these gender perspectives as supplementary research questions, extending our stress-process investigation within the framework of a dyadic interdependence model. Design and MethodsSampleWe use data from Wave 2 (2010–2011) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). NSHAP was launched in 2005/2006 as a nationally representative sample of 3,005 community-dwelling older adults aged 57–85 years in the continental United States (initial response rate = 75.5%). Approximately 75% of the Wave 1 sample was reinterviewed at Wave 2. Marital and cohabiting partners were also added to the sample in Wave 2. Response rate among contacted partners (married or otherwise) was 84.5%, and the overall Wave 2 response rate was 76.9% (). We removed two same-sex couples, as this subset was too small to meaningfully assess in statistical models. Importantly, partners could be outside the age range of the initial NSHAP sample (about 14% of partners were younger than age 62 at Wave 2). Main analyses include the full heterosexual dyadic sample, though sensitivity analyses also examined only those couples where both partners fell within the age range of 62–90 years. Dependent Variable: Sexual InterestOur dependent variable is whether the respondent lacked interest in sex. This outcome was assessed in a section of the survey prefaced by the following statement: “Sometimes people go through periods in which they are not interested in sex or are having trouble with sexual gratification. We have just a few questions about whether during the last 12 months there has ever been a period of several months or more when you …” Respondents could then indicate whether they “lacked interest in sex” by answering “yes” (coded 1) or “no” (coded 0).Although there are many dimensions of sexuality assessed in the NSHAP survey, sexual interest has the analytic advantage of not being conditional on sexual activity (e.g., as do evaluations of sexual quality). Examining outcomes conditional on actually having sex could induce selection bias by excluding respondents who are not sexually active. Independent VariablesHousehold and neighborhood disorder scores are drawn from environmental evaluations conducted by trained members of the NSHAP research team. The measurement procedure was based on principles of systematic social observation as first developed in the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (see ). At the conclusion of the in-home interview, field interviewers evaluated multiple dimensions of the respondents’ home. Five ratings comprise the household disorder scale (α = 0.84; ). The first item comes from the question “How well-kept is the building in which the respondent lives?” ([1] “very poorly kept (needs major repairs)”; [2] “poorly kept” (needs minor repairs); [3] “fairly well kept (needs cosmetic work)”; and [4] “very well kept”). Responses were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate more disorder. The final four items come from a list of adjectives describing the room(s) in which the interview occurred. Interviewers were asked to provide a score on a 1–5 scale. The four contrasting adjectives are [A] (1) quiet—(5) noisy; [B] (1) no smell/pleasant smell—(5) unpleasant smell; [C] (1) clean—(5) dirty; and [D] (1) neat and tidy—(5) messy. In most cases, the same field interviewer administered the survey for both residential partners; for the few couples where environmental evaluations were conducted by different interviewers (n = 124) we produced an averaged dyad-level score. Following the procedure outlined by , we created interviewer-standardized scores for each of the five scale items to account for the different measurement metrics and to minimize the consequences of interviewer-specific evaluation styles (range = −1.02 to 1.80).Neighborhood disorder is operationalized in similar fashion. Field interviewers were asked to assess “how well kept are most of the buildings on the street (one block, both sides) where the respondent lives.” Response options were identical to those used for the respondents’ building (see above) and were also reverse coded. Interviewers were likewise instructed to “describe the street (one block, both sides) where the respondent lives” with a 1–5 scoring scale. Four dimensions were assessed: [A] (1) clean—(5) full of litter or rubble; [B] (1) quiet—(5) noisy; [C] (1) no traffic—(5) traffic; and [D] (1) no smell or air pollution—(5) strong smell or air pollution. Taken together, these five items comprise the NSHAP’s neighborhood disorder scale (; α = 0.75). As above, we ensured that all items were interviewer-standardized and averaged over the dyad when necessary (range = −1.23 to 2.41).Our analyses also account for broader census tract conditions that could underlie neighborhood and household disorder. Specifically, we link NSHAP respondents to tract-level conditions reflecting socioeconomic disadvantage that are measured in the 2005–2009 American Community Survey (ACS): tract proportion poor, proportion on public assistance, and proportion unemployed (note that “unemployed” considers only those of working age who are looking for work). We computed a socioeconomic disadvantage scale using predicted values from an exploratory factor analysis to allow for unequal factor weighting (range = −1.05 to 3.54). Finally, we include a measure of census tract density (persons per square mile, logged) to ensure that neighborhood disorder was not conflated with urban context in the analyses (range = 0–11.69). We obtained ACS from the NORC Social Environment Working Group, who produced these variables in order to investigate the impact of neighborhood change on health outcomes. The 2005–2009 ACS data are currently the only available geographic linkages for NHSAP W2 provided by NORC. However, neighborhoods are unlikely to undergo drastic changes from this period to 2011 and so we have reason to believe that the measures are a reasonable proxy for contextual conditions at NSHAP W2. Relationship QualityRelationship quality was constructed following recommendations from the NSHAP investigative team, using a five-item scale (). The five items that composted the scale were: overall happiness in the relationship (from “very unhappy” to “very happy”), how often the respondent believes their relationship is going well (from “never” to “all the time”), how close they feel to their spouse (from “not very close” to “extremely close”), how often they feel they can rely on them, and how often they feel they can open up to them (last two items, from “never” to “often”). These five items were standardized before forming the scale (α =0.71). This measure had two sub-scales: spousal support (relying on and opening up to one’s spouse; α = 0.60), and relationship happiness (overall happiness, relationship going well, closeness; α = 0.60). The measure was left-skewed but not transformed in the analyses (range = −4.20 to 0.64). ControlsDemographic covariates include self-reported race/ethnicity (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; or other), age (in years), gender (female coded as 1), marital status (married = 1, cohabiting = 0), and education (<high school, high school degree, ≥college degree). Finally, in considering the role of the household for late-life sexuality, it is crucial to consider household composition. Multigenerational households composed of children and/or grandchildren may put constraints on intimate activity. We therefore control for whether other people besides the couple lives in the household (1 = yes, 0 = no).We also consider several health-related covariates as potential confounders. This includes self-reported diagnosis of 15 self-reported chronic health conditions as diagnosed by a physician: heart problems, diabetes, HIV, high blood pressure, arthritis, ulcers, kidney problems, thyroid problems, skin cancer, leukemia, other cancers, asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis, stroke, dementia, and cirrhosis. We isolated diabetes and heart trouble as separate dummy variables and summed the number of other conditions in a count variable (its distribution was somewhat right-skewed; range = 0–6). Self-rated health was measured on a scale from (1) “poor” to (5) “excellent.” Functional impairment denoted an average of the extent to which the respondent reported difficulty (from “no difficulty” (0) to “unable to do” (3) with any of the seven activities of daily life). Physical activity captures how often respondents report doing vigorous exercise (scored from 0, “never” to “5 or more times a week”). Cognitive status was assessed using the Chicago Cognitive Function Measure, which combines tests of orientation, naming, executive function, memory, attention, language, verbal fluency, and abstraction to form a measure of global cognitive function (range = 5–20; ). For mental health, we include scores from NSHAP’s version of the 11-item Iowa form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale in which respondents indicate how often (from “rarely or none of the time” to “most of the time”) they experienced symptoms such as “felt sad” (α = .78). Two items (on happiness and enjoying life) were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate greater depression symptomology (range = 0–22). We also include the seven-item NSHAP Anxiety Symptoms Measure, where respondents reported how often they experienced symptoms such as feeling “tense or wound up” (range = 0–21; α = .73). Both depressive symptoms and anxiety were somewhat right-skewed but left untransformed in our analyses. Respondents were also asked whether they were currently working, which we include as a control. Finally, we include a control for household assets. This measure was produced by averaging reported assets between persons in the same household; where only one person reported their assets, we used that one report to determine household assets. The measure was strongly right-skewed; we took the natural log to reduce the influence of outliers (range = −2.30 to 16.14). AnalysisIn order to account for the nonindependence of lacking interest in sex within dyads, we fit Actor–Partner Interdependence Models (APIMs) to predict whether the participant lacked interest in sex. The APIMs in this paper fit two equations simultaneously: one predicting whether the husband in the dyad lacked interest in sex, and another predicting whether the wife in the dyad lacked interest in sex. Note that a unique strength of APIMs is that they allow researchers to predict outcomes using both the participant’s characteristics (those of the actor) and the characteristics of their matched partner in the data. This approach also estimates within-dyad correlations of residual error terms at the same time as the husband’s and wife’s equations. APIMs were fit using Generalized Estimating Equations with a log-link function (). All APIMs employed dyad-level weights produced by the NSHAP survey research team, in order to produce estimates that more closely correspond with the population of interest (i.e., those who were between the ages of 57–85 in 2005–2006, when NSHAP fielded its first wave of data collection, and their partners). APIMs were fit using multiple imputation with chained equations in order to assuage problems with missing data. Missing data for particular variables ranged from no missing data (e.g., gender) to 17% (cognitive function). Note that we did not impute values of the dependent variable (). We created 10 imputed data sets and fit all models using the mi estimate command in Stata version 14. ResultsDescriptive statistics are show in . Consistent with prior research, wives are more likely to report low interest in sex than their husbands, though husbands tend to report higher levels of marital quality. Husbands tended to be older, more highly educated, and more prone to heart trouble, whereas wives reported more depressive symptoms, had higher levels of anxiety, and demonstrated stronger cognitive abilities. Note that environmental conditions were shared between husbands and wives, so there were no relevant gender contrasts for contextual variables. Table 1.Sample of Older Adult Couples From the National Social Life Health and Aging Project (n = 1,910; All Results Weighted)  presents the APIM results. Among the environmental disorder variables considered, only household disorder predicted low sexual interest, and this only among men. Neighborhood disorder was moderately and positively correlated with household disorder (r = .23), so we considered whether the simultaneous inclusion of both variables may mask the contribution of the former. Reduced models that excluded household disorder (not shown), however, reach the same conclusion—the log odds association between neighborhood disorder and low sexual interest cannot be distinguished from “0.” Census tract density and socioeconomic disadvantage, likewise, had very small and nonsignificant associations with the dependent variable. Table 2.Actor-Partner Interdependence Models, Showing Associations With Lacking Interest in Sex (n = 1,729; All Results Weighted; Log Odds Format) Note: *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001 (tests are two-tailed).To facilitate interpretation of the log-odds coefficients shown in , we present the predicted probability of low sexual interest for husbands and wives according to household disorder level in . Overall, wives are at far higher risk of reporting low sexual interest. Still, husbands’ interest appears somewhat more responsive to the level of disorder in their household, going from a 20% chance of reporting low interest in exceptionally orderly spaces (1 standard deviation [s.d.] below the interviewer-standardized mean) to 40% in relatively disorderly homes (1 s.d. above mean). We emphasize, however, that the predicted probability increases for women look quite similar to the solid lines drawn for men; with larger samples and more statistical power we would likely observe a statistically significant environmental effect for women as well as men. Figure 1.Predicted probabilities of lacking interest in sex, ±1 standard deviation (s.d.) above and below the mean of household disorder. Predicted probabilities are calculated from model 1 in . All covariates are held at their mean or mode. Predictions were only made within ±1 s.d. above and below the mean of household disorder, in order to avoid making predictions in sectors of the data with low coverage (i.e., at particularly high and low ends of the spectrum of household disorder). The figure truncates the x-axis at ±1 s.d. above and below the mean of household disorder to reflect this constraint on our predictions.Figure 1.Predicted probabilities of lacking interest in sex, ±1 standard deviation (s.d.) above and below the mean of household disorder.

The figure truncates the x-axis at ±1 s.d. above and below the mean of household disorder to reflect this constraint on our predictions.Models 2 and 3 expand the basic APIM analysis and consider whether marital quality mediates or moderates the association between household disorder and low sexual interest. There is no evidence of either process. One’s own perception of marital quality (though not one’s partners’ assessment) is strongly and negatively associated with low sexual interest, but including this variable produces little change in husbands’ household disorder coefficient or in its significance level. In supplementary analyses, we also considered whether household disorder predicted lower marital quality (both as a summary scale, and as two sub-scales capturing support availability and satisfaction evaluations, respectively). Surprisingly, disorder had no relation to any indicator of marital quality. All told, these results suggest that marital quality is not an intervening mechanism to explain why husbands living in disorderly homes are more likely to report low sexual interest. Finally, the interactions between household disorder and marital quality (Model 3) were nonsignificant for both partners, implying that the positive association between disorder and low interest among men was not mitigated by a high-quality relationship. Interactions between neighborhood disorder and marital quality were similarly nonsignificant (results not shown in ).Though not the focus of this article, several covariates were associated with husbands’ and wives’ low sexual interest across the three models. Both genders were more likely to report low sexual interest if they felt depressed. Husbands who were older and who had heart trouble were at higher risk of reporting low sexual interest, whereas diabetes was the most evident disease culprit among women. DiscussionThis study considered what environmental context may be able to tell us about sex in later life. Guided by the stress process model, we examined whether household and neighborhood disorder was associated with reduced sexual interest. Disorderly home conditions were indeed associated with low sexual interest, but only significantly so among men. Disorder on the neighborhood block—and broader census-level conditions such as socioeconomic disadvantage and population density—had little discernable impact on sexual interest.Taken together, results point to the importance of proximal environmental conditions. Though many aspects of older adults’ well-being is sensitive to neighborhood circumstances (e.g., poverty, crime, physical disorder; ; ), seniors spend a disproportionate amount of time in their own home (). Given the domicile’s direct relevance for cultivating late-life familial intimacy () and in particular for offering space for sexual activity, it should not be surprising that the home appears to play a stronger role than the block or the census tract when it comes to sexual desire. It is important to note that APIM estimates adjusted for a large number of covariates that predict poor household upkeep—depressive symptoms and chronic disease, for example—and that likewise hamper sexual interest. Controlling for such factors reduces the concern that the link between home disorder and low interest is driven by personal attributes that precede both variables.Results also suggest that male sexual interest may be especially sensitive to the home environment (though statistical comparisons of husbands' vs. wives' coefficients failed to reach conventional levels of statistical significance). We are hesitant to draw overreaching conclusions from this empirical pattern, but theories of gender scripts in sexual relationships may offer some insight. According to this school of thought, heterosexual partners largely assume that the woman has chief responsibility for home upkeep and other domestic tasks (; ). The presence of environmental disorder can thus signal a violation of the gendered normative order which is, in turn, a turn-off to the male partner (; see also ). Curiously, however, our results gave no indication that men living amidst disorder perceived their romantic relationship as being especially low-quality, an intervening variable scenario we might expect under the gendered scripts explanation of lowered male desire. Nevertheless,  stipulate that “traditionally masculine and feminine behaviors consciously or unconsciously serve as turn-ons for individuals” in a gradual process unfolding over time (p. 30, emphasis ours). These subtle dynamics may not be reflected in standard marital quality reports measured at a single moment. Future research can consider other, more nuanced psychosocial resources that may mediate the disorder-interest link among men.Taking a broader view, this article sets the stage for further inquiry on the environmental correlates of late-life sexuality. It is by now axiomatic that factors biological, psychological, and social together shape sexual outcomes (), yet the full promise of this integrative approach has yet to be realized in the study of aging. Research on sexuality early in the life course has been relatively well-attuned to environmental context—revealing, for instance, how neighborhood conditions affect sexual initiation and risk-taking behaviors ()—but gerontologists have been slow to consider the importance of the physical environment as a crucial element of sociosexual context. Now is a fruitful time to pursue this agenda, given our demographic scenario in which more coupled seniors will be aging in place within private households for longer stretches of time than in any past point in history. We suggest several next steps to continue this conversation.First, future research should consider the many additional aspects of late-life sexuality, including frequency of sex, satisfaction with sex, and the diverse array of age-related sexual problems and dysfunctions. Sexual interest was a useful starting point because of its applicability to all seniors, regardless of whether they were sexually active, but many more dimensions of sexual intimacy remain to be investigated.Second, future research should pursue other conceptual dimensions of the sociophysical environment and incorporate alternative measurement strategies. Physical disorder is an acknowledged environmental stressor, but there are alternative ways to operationalize even this construct. Some research on health and place, for instance, draws on seniors’ own perceptions of their environment—is it walkable? comfortable? dangerous?—rather than employing the assessment of trained field interviewers. There are of course some downsides of using self-reports; an individual’s health, cognitive status, or other trait(s) could influence environmental observation, thereby introducing same-source bias (e.g., ). Still, much can be learned about sex and context by taking individual perception into account. Another aspect of the environment worth considering is the age and gender composition of older adults’ neighborhoods. The availability of sexual partners, for instance, could be an important determinant of sustained sexual interest and behavior following late-life divorce or widowhood. Finally, our analysis focused on environmental problems that were expected to impede sexual flourishing in later life. But how can the built environment enhance various aspects of sexuality? Environmental gerontology scholarship addressing home design, aging in place, or the age-friendly city seldom speaks to how spatial context can facilitate sex. Creative new research designs can pursue these intersections and thereby address a surprisingly neglected aspect of seniors’ well-being.Though drawing attention to these important topics, the current study has some notable limitations. First, our dyadic data were available only from one wave of the NSHAP study. Longitudinal data would be useful for examining whether over-time household deterioration is associated with declining sexual interest and for helping rule out potential confounding variables. Second, our analysis was confined to coresidential heterosexual couples. Future research could consider the sexual implications of environmental context for same-sex couples and nonpartnered seniors. Third, there are additional variables unavailable in the NSHAP survey which could confound our association of interest. Time constraints, for instance, could influence both household upkeep and sexual interest. Finally, our environmental assessments were in most cases (79.8%) derived from a single-field interviewer. Though considerably more expensive, a stronger approach would be to deploy multiple field interviewers to each interview site so as to obtain assessments of interrater reliability. Imprecision of environmental measures—of which we lack a definitive estimate—may be one explanation for why neighborhood disorder did not have a discernable association with sexual interest.As far as practice and policy, current findings suggest that health care professionals, elder advocates, and others interested in seniors’ sexual health should give increased attention to household environments. If continued sexual activity enhances individual and marital happiness and yields health benefits in later life (), then straightforward solutions such as in-home cleaning assistance or tax credits for home repairs could have wide-ranging benefits within and beyond the bedroom. Physicians consulting seniors on sexual matters should likewise inquire about residential context, as household upkeep may well matter above and beyond many of the more conventional risk factors assessed in the clinical encounter.
