     Abstract Purpose of Study: The authors determined short-term effects of a home environmental intervention on self-efficacy and upset in caregivers and daily function of dementia patients. They also determined if treatment effect varied by caregiver gender, race, and relationship to patient. Design and Methods: Families (N = 171) of dementia patients were randomized to intervention or usual care control group. The intervention involved 5 90-min home visits by occupational therapists who provided education and physical and social environmental modifi-cations. Results: Compared with controls, intervention caregivers reported fewer declines in patients' instrumental activities of daily living (p = .030) and less decline in self-care and fewer behavior problems in patients at 3 months post-test. Also, intervention spouses reported reduced upset (p = .049), women reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing behaviors (p = .038), and women (p = .049) and minorities (p = .037) reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing functional dependency. Implications: The environmental program appears to have a modest effect on dementia patients' IADL dependence. Also, among certain subgroups of caregivers the program improves self-efficacy and reduces upset in specific areas of caregiving.   Clinical trial ,  Home modification ,  Home care Laurence G. Branch, PhDA primary focus of caregiver research has been on developing and testing interventions for families caring for persons with dementia. Most tested interventions have been psycho-educational, typically involving a combination of counseling, education, stress management, and problem-solving skill development. Recent reviewers of this burgeoning research have concluded that psycho-educational interventions are only moderately effective in reducing caregiver distress and that a broad range of intervention strategies to address the multiple needs of caregivers at each stage of the illness trajectory should be tested (Bourgeois, Schulz, and Burgio 1996   ). These reviewers also suggested the need for future studies to determine what types of interventions benefit which types of caregivers (Biegel and Schulz 1999   ). The few studies that have examined caregiver characteristics in relationship to service use and treatment outcomes suggest differential effects along a number of dimensions. For example, Cox 1998    found that African American caregivers benefited more than White caregivers from a psychosocial intervention, and Zarit, Stephens, Townsend, Greene, and Leitsch 1999    showed that brief users of adult day services tended to be spouses.In this study we evaluated an innovative intervention approach involving occupational therapist home visits targeted at helping caregivers modify their living space to address daily caregiving challenges. Whereas psycho-educational interventions have been extensively evaluated, that is not the case for a home environmental approach. The rationale for using the home environment as a therapeutic modality is based in a competence-environmental press framework and recent advances in control theory. A competence-environmental press framework suggests that as competency declines, an unchanging physical and social environment poses significant demands or press on an individual that may result in negative behavioral and functional outcomes (Lawton and Nahemow 1973   ). Adjusting and simplifying dimensions of the environment to match reduced competency may minimize excess disability in persons with dementia. For example, removing unnecessary objects from a room may enhance orientation and reduce confusion and agitation.Additionally, personal control theory provides the rationale for why an environmental approach may also benefit caregivers. According to this theory, maintaining control is a universal imperative achieved by using primary mechanisms such as changing the immediate environment (e.g., people, objects), secondary mechanisms such as changing cognition or emotions, or a combination thereof (Schulz and Heckhausen 1999   ). The unsuccessful application of these mechanisms to achieve control may result in negative affective consequences such as emotional upset and lowered self-efficacy. Applied to the caregiving context, family members may be motivated to use an environmental strategy, a primary mechanism, as a part of their repertoire of coping strategies to achieve personal control over overwhelming and unpredictable situations. Maintaining personal control may in turn reduce upset and enhance self-efficacy beliefs among caregivers.A few exploratory studies have shown that family caregivers accept and use environmental strategies and perceive them as helpful in addressing specific dementia-related behaviors. These studies, however, have used single-case and panel designs, and outcomes have been limited to utilization rates of environmental strategies and self-reported benefits. Pynoos and Ohta 1991   , in a pilot study of 12 family caregivers, found that 66% of recommended environmental strategies were reported by caregivers as initially effective in managing specific problems, and of those, 89% remained in use at study follow-up. Consistent with this study, Gitlin and Corcoran 1993    found that among 17 spouse caregivers, 92% of environmental strategies offered by occupational therapists to improve bathing routines were subsequently implemented by caregivers and were reported as helpful in reducing resistance to bathing. For managing incontinence, caregivers used 53% of the recommendations that were offered. These findings suggest that caregivers are selective about which environmental strategies they use but that those that are acceptable are implemented. Other studies have also shown that caregivers, independent of a formal service provider and through trial and error, adjust the physical home environment in response to safety concerns, wandering, or a decline in self-care (Olsen, Ehrenkrantz, and Hutchings 1993   ). In clinical practice, environmental recommendations for home safety have become routine in hospital and home care (Alzheimer Association 1997   ). Nevertheless, the effects of helping caregivers modify their home environment on caregiver well-being and level of dependency of the person with dementia remain untested.We report on a randomized controlled study of a home environmental intervention with family caregivers. The intervention provided caregivers with a set of skills and strategies that lowered the threshold or press of the social and physical environment for the person with dementia. That is, the intervention was designed to help caregivers develop an environment supportive of reduced competencies such that the person with dementia would exhibit fewer disruptive behaviors and experience a slower rate of decline in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs and ADLs). Moreover, because this approach provided caregivers with practical skills and a mechanism to exert control over difficult situations, it targeted caregiver upset and self-efficacy beliefs in managing day to day. Therefore, we anticipated that the intervention would affect behavioral occurrences and functional dependency of the person with dementia as reported by the caregiver as well as the caregiver's own level of upset and self-efficacy with these problem areas.Additionally, in this study, we wanted to determine whether certain caregivers evinced greater benefits than others from this type of intervention on the basis of gender, race, and relationship to the person with dementia. An environmental intervention is behaviorally demanding in that it requires caregivers to actively problem solve; change lifelong daily routines; and adjust or remove material aspects of the environment that may have personal, symbolic, and historical meaning. We speculated that the intervention might not work for everyone. Previous research on caregiving has shown that family caregivers differ in their coping styles and appraisals of their situation on the basis of a number of characteristics including gender, race, and their relationship to the person with dementia (Kramer 1997   ; Levin, Chatters, and Taylor 1995   ). Because our previous research showed that women were more likely to comply with a home environmental intervention than men (Gitlin, Corcoran, Winter, Boyce, and Marcus 1999   ), we speculated that women would derive greater therapeutic benefit than men. We also anticipated that minority caregivers, the majority of whom were African American in this study, would demonstrate greater benefit than White caregivers on the basis of previous research that has shown that African Americans are more likely to derive improved self-efficacy from behavior-change interventions. Finally, given that studies on caregiving have consistently shown that spouses have higher rates of upset and depression than nonspouse caregivers (Pruchno and Resch 1989   ), we believed that spouses had more to gain from this intervention.In this study we have contributed systematically to the growing body of caregiver intervention research by testing a new intervention approach; examining outcomes for both the caregiver and the person with dementia; and determining whether treatment effects vary by caregiver gender, race, and relationship. Methods Participants Family caregivers were recruited from local social service and medical centers and through media announcements in the Philadelphia region between 1993 and 1996. To participate in the study, caregivers had to live with a family member with a medical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder, perceive themselves as the primary caregiver, report dependence of the person with dementia in at least two ADLs, and report one or more difficulties managing either IADL or ADL assistance or a dementia-related behavior (e.g., wandering, agitation). Caregivers of persons who were bedridden and nonresponsive to touch or the physical environment were excluded from participating in the study. We designed these criteria to provide a sample of caregivers that were confronted with difficulties managing functional dependency and behavioral difficulties, the target of the intervention. These criteria also excluded caregivers of persons for which an environmental adaptation would have relatively no benefit given their severe stage of dementia.A trained interviewer met with eligible caregivers in their homes, obtained signed informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board, and conducted the baseline interview. Following the baseline interview, caregivers were randomly assigned to either treatment or a usual care control condition. Randomization was stratified by gender (male, female) and race (minority, White) to ensure equivalence between experimental and control group participants along these two characteristics. Participants were interviewed again following completion of the intervention at 3 months postbaseline. Control group participants received education materials and a booklet describing home environmental safety tips at the conclusion of the study. Home Environmental Intervention The environmental program, described in detail elsewhere (Corcoran and Gitlin 1992   ; Gitlin et al. 1999   ) is briefly reviewed here. The intervention, which is based in a competence-environmental press framework and personal control theory as discussed earlier, is a targeted, multicomponent program led by an occupational therapist. It involves educating caregivers about the impact of the environment on dementia-related behaviors and helping caregivers simplify objects in the home (e.g., remove clutter), break down tasks (e.g., one- or two-step commands, lay out clothing in the order in which it is to be donned), and involve other members of the family network or formal supports in daily caregiving tasks. For example, occupational therapists provided education about dementia and the relationship between excess stimulation (auditory and visual) and behavioral disturbances such as agitation or resistance to assistance with self-care. Strategies such as removing objects to simplify the home and breaking down tasks provided primary control mechanisms by which caregivers could manage problems areas, such as agitation or the inability to follow directions or initiate tasks by the person with dementia.The program consisted of five 90-min sessions that were spaced approximately every other week over 3 months. In the first home session, the occupational therapist met with the caregiver to develop a targeted plan that addressed the specific aspects of daily care (e.g., bathing, dressing, activity engagement, caregiver fatigue) that were problematic and for which the caregiver wanted to learn new strategies. Education about the disease process was also introduced in this session. In the second visit, the occupational therapist used role-play, direct observation, and interviewing to explore the ways in which the caregiver handled problem areas and conceptualized or cognitively framed their situation. Education about dementia and the role of the physical and social environment was presented in relation to the specific care difficulties presented by caregivers. The therapists engaged caregivers in mutual problem solving to identify alternate care strategies using an environmental perspective. Environmental simplification and task breakdown strategies were introduced, and caregivers were asked to practice their use prior to the next home visit. In each subsequent home visit, the occupational therapist reinforced education about dementia through written materials and discussion, addressed a targeted problem area, observed the caregiver using previously recommended strategies, provided refinements to those strategies, and/or offered new recommendations. In the course of providing verbal instruction, the therapist used cognitive restructuring and validation to instill greater perceived control and confidence in the caregivers' own abilities to manage the problem and to develop more realistic appraisals of the caregiving situation, dementia-related behaviors, and expectations. Helping caregivers reframe attributions and explain events was important to enable behavioral change and the use of environmental strategies. Also, therapists served as coaches and provided ongoing validation and reinforcement of the caregivers' use of environmental strategies. In the final visit, the occupational therapist reviewed previously introduced strategies and how they might be applied to future potential problems.The 10 occupational therapists that served as interventionists for this study were licensed practitioners with at least 1 year experience in home care or working with older adults. Although occupational therapists are formally trained in a person-environment framework, this intervention represented a nontraditional approach in that the focus was exclusively on enhancing the environmental problem-solving skills of the caregiver. Accordingly, the intervention represented a unique program for which training was required. Therapists participated in 20 hr of training conducted by the investigators in which they were introduced to the intervention protocol, specific strategies, and treatment documentation. We monitored the occupational therapists throughout the study using several techniques to ensure treatment fidelity. These included formal case reviews, on-site observation of randomly selected visits, and follow-up interviews with caregivers to evaluate their satisfaction with the intervention process. Measures Basic background characteristics of family caregivers and their coding included age, income, education, and number of months caregiving collected as continuous variables and gender, relationship to person with dementia (spouse, nonspouse), race (White, minority), and marital status (married, not married). Outcome Variables Nine outcome variables were examined, three of which referred to the performance of the person with dementia, and six of which referred to the well-being of caregivers. Outcomes Related to the Dementia Patient. Concerning the dementia patient, we were interested in three outcomes: the frequency of occurrence of behavioral problems, the level of dependency in ADLs, and the level of dependency in IADLs. For behavior problems, family caregivers reported on the frequency of behavioral occurrences using 29 items from the Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (MBPC; Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson 1980   ) and four additional behaviors reported in the literature that were relevant to the focus of the intervention. Although respondents rated how often each problem occurred on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = "never" to 4 = "at least once a day"), for these analyses we computed an index that reflected the total number of behaviors that occurred. We refer to this index as Behaviors. High scores indicated the occurrence of a greater number of problem behaviors (Cronbach's alpha = .78).For dependency, family caregivers were asked to rate the level of ADL dependence of the person with dementia using a modification of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM; Granger and Hamilton 1992   ). We used eight items from the mobility domain of the FIM (bathing, eating, dressing upper and lower body, toileting, grooming, getting around the house, getting in and out of bed). For this study, we collapsed the FIM ratings of complete independence (7) and modified independence (6) to represent independence (without or with an assistive device or extended time). We also reverse coded the scoring of items. A high score reflected greater dependency such that 1 referred to complete independence and 6 to total dependence. We computed a total score by averaging the scores for all items. We refer to this index as ADL dependence. Cronbach's alpha for ADL dependence was .90.Caregivers were also asked to rate the level of dependence in nine IADLs using the same 6-point modified FIM rating scale described previously. Included were eight items from Lawton and Brody 1969   (meal preparation, management of finances, telephone use, housework, laundry, grocery shopping, travel, and taking medication) and one additional item, leisure participation. We averaged the scores for these items to derive the index we refer to as IADL dependence. High scores indicated greater dependence. Cronbach's alpha was .60 for this sample. Outcomes Related to Caregiver Well-Being. —We examined two dimensions of caregiver well-being: self-efficacy and upset in managing dementia behaviors, IADL dependence, and ADL dependence.Self-efficacy refers to an individual's assessment of his or her ability to perform specific activities and achieve a desired outcome (Bandura 1997   ). Whereas the related concept of mastery refers to a global assessment, self-efficacy concerns beliefs about one's competence to successfully perform discrete or specific tasks. Self-efficacy beliefs may therefore vary across specific activities of caregiving (Haley et al. 1996   ; McAvay, Seeman, and Rodin 1996   ). This relationship may exist because self-efficacy influences the initiation and maintenance of effort in demanding situations. To examine situation-specific self-efficacy, we used the approach of Haley and colleagues (Haley, Levine, Brown, and Bartolucci 1987   ; Haley et al. 1996   ) in which caregivers rate their level of confidence in handling specific caregiving tasks and problems. This approach allows the computation of average self-efficacy scores based on the particular problem areas of caregiving. Scores are independent of the total number of items. Thus, for each reported behavioral occurrence that was identified with the MBPC and each ADL and IADL activity for which assistance was required as measured by the modified FIM, caregivers were asked to rate their confidence in managing the item. Initially, we scored each item using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = "not at all confident" to 4 = "extremely confident"). For these analyses, however, we followed the approach of McAvay and colleagues 1996    and recoded each item into a dichotomous indicator to reflect low versus high levels of efficacy (0 = "not at all or a little confident," 1 = "moderately to extremely confident"). This approach is clinically meaningful and maximizes the potential to detect change at post-test. We then computed three indices by summing the respective dichotomized scores on each item and dividing by the number of reported items. We refer to these indices as behavior self-efficacy, ADL self-efficacy, and IADL self-efficacy. Higher scores indicated greater perceived self-efficacy in managing behaviors that occurred or the self-care activities in which caregiver assistance was provided. Cronbach's alpha could not be calculated for these indices, because each caregiver rated different items within each index (Haley et al. 1996   ).Upset reflects the operational definition of a caregiver's appraisal in coping with problem areas (Lazarus and Folkman 1984   ). Caregivers were asked to rate their level of upset on a 5-point scale (0 = "no upset" to 4 = "extremely upset") for each behavioral occurrence and IADL and ADL item. We followed the procedures for self-efficacy and recoded each item as a dichotomous indicator (0 = "not at all or very little upset," 1 = "moderate or extreme upset"). A mean caregiver upset score was then computed for each index. We refer to these indices as behavior upset, ADL upset, and IADL upset. Higher scores for each index indicated greater caregiver upset. To derive an alpha coefficient, we coded caregiver upset as 0 (no upset) for cases where no problem was reported. We reasoned that if the problem did not exist, then the caregiver did not experience upset with that area. Cronbach's alpha for this sample was .88 for the behavior upset index, .57 for the IADL upset index, and .76 for ADL upset index. Analysis We compared background characteristics of the caregiver, the three outcome variables specific to the functioning of the person with dementia (behaviors, ADL dependence, and IADL dependence), and the six outcome variables specific to caregiver well-being (ADL self-efficacy, IADL self-efficacy, behavior self-efficacy, ADL upset, IADL upset, and behavior upset) using chi-square and t tests as appropriate to determine significant differences between experimental and control group participants at baseline.Following the intention-to-treat principle, all randomized participants with follow-up data were included in the analyses regardless of number of intervention sessions completed. We examined the main effects of the intervention on ADL and IADL dependency and behavioral occurrences of persons with dementia (the three outcomes related to the dementia patient), and domain-specific caregiver self-efficacy and upset (the six outcomes related to caregivers) at 3 months postbaseline using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the entire sample for which data were available. Baseline values were the covariates in each of the nine analyses.Next, we used separate regression analyses to examine possible differential effects of the intervention on the basis of gender (male, female), relationship (spouse, nonspouse), or race (White, minority) of caregivers. Each of these analyses consisted of a sequence of models. For each analysis, we entered the baseline score of the outcome variable first to control for initial differences between participants. Next, treatment assignment was entered. In the third step, the characteristic of interest was entered (e.g., gender, relationship, or race). In the final step, the effect of the intervention was measured by the interaction of treatment and the specific characteristic. We considered these analyses to be secondary to the initial main effects model. We therefore tested each interaction in separate models because we did not have sufficient power to test all the interactions of interest in a single model. We report in this article only the interactions that were large in magnitude and/or reached statistical significance.We repeated the previous analyses with two additional covariates, months caregiving and behavior self-efficacy, in addition to the baseline value of the outcome variable. We conducted these analyses to control for potential nonrandomized bias because there were large differences between caregivers who remained in the study and those that dropped out along these variables, although these differences were not statistically significant. However, the results did not change and we do not report these models.The reported p values were not corrected for multiple endpoints. We conducted analyses of the main effects for nine outcomes. The secondary analyses of the interactions considered a total of 27 interactions (3 for each of the 9 outcomes). We conducted all analyses using SPSS version 9.0. The level of significance was set at .05. Results Recruitment and Attrition Rates A total of 202 family caregivers were enrolled in the study, of which 100 were randomly assigned to intervention and 102 were assigned to the control group. Of this group, 171 participated in the 3-month postbaseline assessment, 93 in the treatment group, and 78 in the control group. This represented a total of 31 caregivers that were unavailable at post-test or a 15% attrition rate for the total sample. Of the 31 caregivers who dropped out, 7 (23%) were in the experimental group and 24 (77%) were in the control group. This differential dropout rate was statistically significant (p = .001). Reasons for not participating in the follow-up interview included illness (6 caregivers), illness of the care recipient (7 caregivers), extended vacation (5 caregivers) or unknown reasons (13 caregivers).We compared the 31 dropouts (intervention and control participants) to the 171 remaining participants (stay-ins) on their baseline scores for demographic variables and outcome variables ( Table 1  ). There were no large or statistically significant differences between the two groups, except for months caregiving and behavior self-efficacy, in which differences were large but not significant.We also compared experimental group participants who dropped out (n = 7) to experimental group participants (n = 93) who remained in the study along all variables. Again, there were no large or significant differences between the groups. Likewise, similar analyses showed no statistical differences between control group dropouts (n = 24) and control group stay-ins (n = 78) on any study variables. Sample Characteristics Baseline characteristics of participants in both the experimental and control groups are shown in  Table 2  . There were no large or significant differences at baseline between the two groups. The sample was primarily female, married, and had a high school or higher education. Of the 171 participants, 126 (74%) identified themselves as White, 43 (25%) identified as African American, 1 caregiver identified as Hispanic, and 1 identified as other. Spouse caregivers represented 25% of the sample. Therefore, most caregivers were not spouses, with daughters and daughters-in-law constituting 59% of the sample; sons, sons-in-law, and grandsons 13% of the sample; and other family relationships (e.g., nephew) 3% of the sample. Caregivers were, on average, 61 years of age (range = 23 to 92 years) and reported providing care for an average of 45 months (range = 2 months to 16 years).This group of caregivers reported, on average, minimal to no upset with ADL and IADL dependencies and only a modest level of upset with behavioral occurrences. Caregivers also reported, on average, a moderate level of self-efficacy in managing IADLs, ADLs, and behavioral disturbances. Care recipients varied widely in their level of functional dependency as reported by caregivers. A high level of dependency (mean FIM score = 5.5) occurred in IADLs, with 56% of caregivers reporting moderate to complete dependence in all nine IADLs and 23% reporting moderate to complete dependence in eight IADLs. In contrast, a minimal level of dependency (mean FIM score = 3.1) in ADLs was found, with only 13% reporting some level of dependence in all seven ADLs. Compliance With Intervention Compliance with the intervention was measured in two ways. First, we considered the number of visits completed, referred to as the level of participation. Second, we considered the proportion of strategies used to those provided by the occupational therapists at each intervention session, referred to as the level of adherence. We considered participation in four home sessions and use of or adherence to at least 50% of the strategies provided in intervention as necessary to achieve a treatment effect. We found that the intervention group participated in an average of four home visits, with 69% participating in at least four sessions and only 9% in one session. We also found that 75% of the strategies provided by the occupational therapists were used or adhered to by caregivers. We thus considered compliance with the intervention, as measured by participation and adherence, to be adequate (Gitlin et al. 1999   ). Effect of Intervention on Study Outcomes  Table 3  shows baseline and post-test mean scores along with the adjusted mean and confidence interval for experimental and control group participants for the nine outcome variables. There were no significant or large differences at baseline between experimental and control group participants for the nine outcome variables. In regard to the outcomes related to dementia patients, there was a statistically significant effect in one of the three outcomes studied; caregivers in the experimental group reported less decline in IADL dependence in the person with dementia than control group caregivers (p = .03). There was a trend toward less decline from baseline to post-test for behaviors and ADL dependence, although these were not statistically significant.For each of the six study outcomes related to caregiver well-being, ANCOVAs showed a marginal improvement from baseline to post-test for the experimental group in comparison with the control group, although these improvements were not statistically significant. Effect of Intervention for Specific Subgroups We conducted separate regression analyses to examine intervention by specific caregiver characteristic (race, gender, and relationship) interaction effects.  Table 4  shows the adjusted mean effect, difference of means, confidence interval for the mean difference, and interaction p values for significant interaction effects and those approaching significance. Not shown on the table is the interaction term of ADL self-efficacy by race. Although this interaction did not approach statistical significance, the magnitude of the interaction effect was large (adjusted mean effect, minority = .08, White = .00) such that minority caregivers showed a trend toward improvement and Whites did not.As shown in  Table 4  , a number of interaction effects were larger than the main effects ( Table 3  ). The largest interactions were for caregiver behavior self-efficacy and behavior upset. For behavior self-efficacy, women showed a benefit and men declined by an equal amount. For behavior upset, nonspouses showed no benefit and spouses a large benefit. The other large benefit was for minority caregivers in IADL self-efficacy in contrast to no benefit for Whites. Finally, with regard to ADL dependence, male caregivers reported less decline in self-care dependence of dementia patients than female caregivers, and this approached significance. Discussion In contrast to previous caregiver studies that have tested psycho-educational approaches, in this intervention trial we evaluated an environmental approach. This five-session home program involved educating caregivers about the impact of their living space on dementia-related behaviors and introducing modifications to the home in response to caregiver concerns with dependency and behavioral disturbances. The intervention provided caregivers with primary control mechanisms, that is, strategies to reduce environmental press, and self-knowledge of their skills. The findings of this study suggest that an environmental approach has a positive impact on both the caregiver and the person with dementia such that it may slow the progression of IADL dependence of patients and enhance self-efficacy and reduce upset for select caregivers.The present study systematically builds on and expands caregiver intervention research in four significant ways. First, we used a controlled design to determine the impact of an innovative approach that has previously not been systematically tested. Second, the intervention was innovative in that it involved teaching family caregivers the knowledge and skills to manipulate components of the physical environment, skills that are not traditionally included in psycho-educational caregiver interventions. Also, this intervention was innovative in that it differed from traditional occupational therapy practice. Typically, occupational therapy home care is driven by reimbursement considerations, so treatment focus is on the impaired person and improving function. Although therapists may provide education to caregivers, the service remains patient based. Third, this study extends knowledge about the types of outcomes to include in caregiver intervention research. Self-efficacy has not typically been included in previous intervention research. Also, with few exceptions, research has not examined functional change in the person with dementia following a home intervention (Bourgeois, Burgio, Schulz, Beach, and Palmer 1997   ; Chang 1999   ). Fourth, this study extends previous research on caregiver interventions by examining whether certain caregivers derive benefit from the intervention than others. As articulated by Biegel and Schulz 1999   , the next step in caregiver studies is to identify specific characteristics of individuals who benefit from different types of interventions. We evaluated the impact of caregiver gender, race, and relationship on treatment gains as a first step in understanding the relationship between intervention and caregiver characteristics.In accordance with clinical trial research principles, we first examined intervention effects for the entire sample. We found a small but statistically significant effect such that caregivers in the treatment group reported fewer declines in IADLs than caregivers in the control group 3 months postbaseline. This suggests that through intervention the caregivers developed an environment that was supportive of IADL performance such that persons with dementia experienced slightly less dependency in comparison with controls over time. That is, although caregivers in both the experimental and control group reported decline in IADL performance from baseline to 3 months, those in treatment were able to maintain more function of the person with dementia. To assess IADL status, we used the FIM response set, which is a measure of level of assistance required to perform a task. It reflects caregiver burden in that scores represent the level of care provided, at least as perceived by the caregiver. This finding suggests that the intervention had a modest impact on the level of burden as perceived by caregivers in the area of IADL management. The extent to which there was an objective reduction in dependence in IADLs remains questionable. A limitation of this study might have been the reliance on caregiver report to characterize dependence of the dementia patient. Some research has suggested that caregivers tend to report greater functional dependence in persons with dementia (Skurla, Rogers, and Sunderland 1988   ). Nevertheless, one recent study has shown that scores derived from caregiver self-report of function of a person with dementia using the FIM significantly correlates with FIM scores derived from direct observation of performance by a trained professional (Cotter, Burgio, Stephens, Roth, & Gitlin, in press). Thus, caregiver ratings of function in our study may reflect objective IADL performance.There were no statistically significant differences, however, in the other eight outcome measures, including ADL dependence and behaviors, and caregiver self-efficacy and upset scores between the experimental and control groups. The analyses showed a trend toward improvement in all areas for the experimental group, but these minimal effects were not statistically significant, for several possible reasons.First, one reason we did not see main effects is that we did find interaction effects, suggesting that the intervention did not have a consistent effect. The inclusion of groups that did not benefit from intervention may dilute the main effects.Second, a limitation of the present study may be that intervention effects were examined at one time point immediately following completion of the intervention. Caregivers may need more time to practice and use environmental strategies before beneficial outcomes are measurable. The 3-month post-test may have been too close to the intervention for us to adequately evaluate treatment effects. A few caregiver intervention studies have shown a delayed intervention effect such that caregivers report reduced burden and less depression but only over an extended period of time (Mittelman et al. 1995   ). Studies on environmental interventions with other populations have also reported a delayed positive effect of up to a year (Mann, Ottenbacher, Fraas, Tomita, and Granger 1999   ). Future research should consider evaluating the impact of home environmental strategies over a longer time period.Third, it may be that an environmental approach for caregivers requires a higher dose and level of intensity than that tested in this study. Case presentations and anecdotal comments by the interventionists support this point. Interventionists reported that some caregivers appeared to need more time than the protocol allowed to practice and incorporate the recommended environmental strategies. Also, interventionists reported that caregivers who initially rejected recommendations often inquired about these strategies at the final intervention visit. A consistent finding in research on the use of environmental modifications is that individuals are highly selective in their acceptance and use of environmental strategies and need repeated opportunities to think about and practice strategies. In their review of caregiver interventions, Biegel and Schulz 1999    also suggested that more may be better and that interventions of high intensity and long duration appear to work best.Fourth, a limitation of this intervention trial was that some recommendations, such as the purchase or installation of adaptive equipment (e.g., commode or grab bars), were recommended but not actually provided or installed for the caregiver. Providing equipment was beyond the scope of this particular study. Other community-based studies have shown that recommending such strategies without assisting in their installation may result in noncompliance because of the cost and time required for an individual to follow these prescriptions. Although these types of recommendations represented a very small percentage of those offered in intervention, they may still have had some impact on outcomes. Yet another explanation may be that this group of caregivers initially reported only minimal upset with dementia-related behaviors and functional dependency and moderately high self-efficacy. There may have been a ceiling effect such that the potential for improvement was limited.Turning to the subgroup analyses, we were interested in determining whether there was a differential treatment effect. Because our previous research had shown differential compliance rates on the basis of caregiver characteristics, we were interested in determining treatment effects for men and women, spouses and nonspouses, and minority and nonminority participants (Gitlin et al. 1999   ). Also, because the intervention was behaviorally demanding and required caregivers to engage in mutual problem solving and behavioral change, we reasoned that it might benefit only certain caregivers who may be predisposed to this type of approach.This intervention trial did suggest that there were modest gains for specific groups of caregivers. Specifically, women showed enhanced self-efficacy in managing both troublesome behaviors and IADL dependence compared with men. This gender difference may be explained in part by previous research on the coping styles of male and female caregivers. This literature suggests that women are more likely to focus on the emotional aspects of care, spend more time carrying out both instrumental and personal care, and admit the need for assistance and seek social support (Connidis and Davies 1990   ; Neal, Ingersoll-Dayton, and Starrels 1997   ). Conversely, men tend to be more self-reliant and use an authoritative, problem-solving approach that may reflect their traditional work role (Kramer 1997   ). Consequently, the caregiving style of women may be a better match with the client-driven approach to treatment delivery of this environmental program. In this intervention, occupational therapists initially worked with caregivers to identify their specific areas of concern and tailored strategies to address those areas. Also, because women may be more intensely involved with instrumental and personal care, they may actually experience more environmental challenges and may therefore be receptive to an intervention that provides instruction in its modification. Alternately, previous research has shown that being male is associated with a higher sense of control (Pearlin and Schooler 1978   ; Thoits 1987   ). Male caregivers in our study did report at baseline higher confidence (mean = .83) in managing troublesome behaviors than women (mean = .73, p = .031) and managing IADL dependency (mean = .92 for men and .85 for women, p = .07). As a result, there may have been less room for improvement among male participants. Also, as previously reported, we found the men had lower rates of adherence to the intervention (Gitlin et al. 1999   ). Hence, higher self-efficacy at baseline combined with lower compliance with intervention may explain why male participants showed less self-efficacy enhancement after intervention. Ideally, to benefit from the intervention, participants should start with low self-efficacy and be maximally compliant with the program.Minority participants in the treatment group also showed greater improvement in IADL and ADL self-efficacy compared with White participants. Of the 45 minority participants in this sample, 43 (96%) were African American. The treatment by race differential found in this study may be explained in part by previous research reporting lower mean levels of self-efficacy among African Americans compared with Whites (Lachman 1985   ). Minority participants in our study did report at baseline lower self-efficacy in managing behaviors and ADL and IADL dependency compared with White participants, although the difference was statistically significant only for ADL self-efficacy. This suggests that African American study participants had more room for improvement because they initially had lower scores. Alternately, other studies have shown that African American caregivers may be predisposed to experience improvements in self-efficacy (McAvay et al. 1996   ).It is difficult to determine from this study whether the enhancements evidenced by minority caregivers are in part explained by gender. However, the fact that women showed gains in the domain of behavior and IADL self-efficacy and that minority caregivers gained in ADL and IADL self-efficacy would suggest that these groups obtained somewhat different benefits. Clearly, more research is required to disentangle these relations and the salience of both race and gender in structuring intervention gains.We predicted that the intervention would not only enhance self-efficacy but also reduce levels of upset. We found, however, that the intervention did not reduce upset for either women or men. One explanation may be that upset and self-efficacy represent conceptually distinct appraisals, such that caregivers may find a behavior upsetting but have confidence in their ability to manage it. Another explanation for why we did not see a treatment by gender interaction for upset is a floor effect. There was minimal upset reported at baseline with behaviors and IADL dependency such that improvement may not have been possible.We did find a differential treatment effect on the basis of the familial relationship of the caregiver to the person with dementia and upset. Specifically, spouse caregivers demonstrated reduced upset with behavioral occurrences in comparison with nonspouse caregivers. Both groups reported similar low levels of upset and moderate levels of self-efficacy at baseline, so a ceiling effect for one group or the other was not operative here. One explanation for this treatment by relationship differential may be related to the consistent finding in previous research of the relatively high rate of depression and emotional upset experienced by spouse caregivers. Spouses may thus be more likely to experience reduced upset or intervention benefit than nonspouse caregivers. Previous research has shown that behavioral disturbances are the primary source of upset for family caregivers rather than IADL and ADL dependency of the person with dementia. Also, the literature has consistently shown a significant relationship between depressive symptoms and reactions of caregivers to problem behaviors. A reduction in the level of upset with behavioral occurrences may be clinically significant in that it may lessen the risk for depression.Thus, intervention effects were seen more in the area of self-efficacy for select participants. The gains in self-efficacy that were shown for women and minority caregivers, although admittedly modest, may be clinically important. There is abundant research literature showing that feeling efficacious is beneficial to both psychological and physical health (McAvay et al. 1996   ; Rodin and McAvay 1992   ). The role of perceived control in buffering the effects of stressful situations in older people has been shown to function similarly among family caregivers (Skaff, Pearlin, and Mullan 1996   ). Specifically, caregivers with high levels of mastery tend to be at lower risk for depression and role overload (Yate, Tennstedt, and Chang 1999   ).We could not compare the differential treatment effects we found in this study to other caregiver intervention trials because, with few exceptions, such studies have not systematically tested for differences. One study that tested the effectiveness of a brief education program for 40 spouse caregivers of persons with dementia (Chiverton and Caine 1989   ) found no gender difference in coping ability as a consequence of intervention. Likewise, Mittelman and colleagues 1995    found that gender was not associated with changes in depression over time following an intervention.In summary, the entire treatment group demonstrated gains in the area of IADL dependence, and there was a decline in upset and improved sense of efficacy beliefs for specific subgroups of caregivers. The data suggest that this is a helpful approach with female, African American, and spouse caregivers, whereas the intervention would need to be adjusted to match the needs of male and nonspouse caregivers. The findings also suggest that further research is warranted to evaluate a more intense and long-term intervention involving home environmental strategies, its underlying mechanisms, and the subsequent impact of improved self-efficacy on caregiver psychological and physical health. Finally, the findings provide preliminary evidence of the importance of examining intervention effects for specific subgroups of caregivers and incrementally add to an understanding of who benefits from interventions.

     Abstract Purpose: Public-use datasets can extend data collected by individual investigators in various ways: making external comparisons, providing additional data on individual respondents, and creating internal comparison groups. The authors describe the advantages and limitations of these methods and practical and conceptual issues in combining investigator-initiated and public-use datasets. Design and Methods: These issues are illustrated with a study of functional decline among 674 patients following hospitalization for hip fracture that was augmented with data from a public-use dataset, the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Results:By creating an internal comparison group of EPESE respondents, frequency matched to hip fracture patients on age, sex, and baseline functional limitations, the authors formed a single dataset and performed multivariable analyses of factors associated with functional decline. Implications: Gerontological research may benefit by applying these methods to program evaluations and longitudinal analyses of health outcomes with numerous public-use datasets.   Data linkage ,  EPESE ,  Hip fracture ,  Physical functioning Laurence G. Branch, PhDInvestigators are using public-use datasets increasingly to extend data collected by gerontological researchers. These datasets are becoming more available (Post 1996   ), as are methods to link them to datasets from investigator-initiated studies. In this article we describe three methods of combining investigator and public-use datasets and examine the methodological challenges, benefits, and limitations of each method.Traditionally, investigators have used public-use datasets to provide external comparison groups to their own samples, such as comparing rates of well-being among caregivers to rates in general populations (George and Gwyther 1986   ; Pruchno, Kleban, Michaels, and Dempsey 1990   ). By external comparison group, we mean a referent group that is drawn from a different source than the investigator's data, usually because the investigator selected participants on the basis of a specific exposure (such as members of a caregiver support group) and there was no logical group of unexposed persons from the same source (i.e., an internal comparison group; Kelsey, Whittemore, Evans, and Thompson 1996   ).Recently, investigators have used public-use datasets in another way: to supplement data on their samples with endpoints from public-use datasets. Examples include health care utilization and health outcomes from Medicare claims files (Lillard and Farmer 1997   ; Lu-Yao et al. 1996   ; Newschaffer et al. 1998   ; Potosky, Riley, Lubitz, Mentnech, and Kessler 1993   ), cancer incidence and mortality from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) dataset and other cancer registries (Lu-Yao et al. 1996   ; McClish et al. 1997   ; Newschaffer et al. 1998   ; Potosky et al. 1993   ), all-cause mortality from the National Death Index (Fredman, Magaziner, Hebel, Hawkes, and Zimmerman 1999   ; Howe 1998   ), and outcomes among nursing home residents with Medicaid records (Lipowski and Bigelow 1996   ) and with the Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Drug Use via Epidemiology (SAGE) database (Bernabei et al. 1999   ).A third method is to merge an investigator's cohort with public-use data to create an internal comparison group, the result being a single dataset that includes exposed (the investigator's sample) and unexposed (the public-use sample) individuals. This method allows the investigator to address numerous questions that can only be answered with an internal comparison group.In this article we compare these three methods. We use as an example a study of functional decline following hip fracture in which we merged an investigator's dataset (Magaziner et al. 2000   ) with a public-use dataset, the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE; Cornoni-Huntley, Brock, Ostfeld, Taylor, and Wallace 1986   ; Guralnik, Ferrucci, Simonsick, Salive, and Wallace 1995   ). We describe the methodologic issues and decisions we made in merging these two datasets and the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches we chose. Definition of Public-Use Datasets Public-use datasets may be defined as data from federal or state agencies, and datasets placed in the public domain, that are available to researchers. These datasets may include population health records, such as mortality records, and disease registries, such as cancer registries. They may also include records on health care utilization and costs, such as Medicare and Medicaid records. Other types of public-use datasets include information from studies of nationally representative samples, such as the National Health Interview Survey, as well as studies of specific populations. Examples of these latter datasets that are relevant to gerontologists are the National Long-term Care Surveys, the EPESE study, the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study, and datasets available through the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA), to name a few (see Appendix). Datasets such as the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA) are already linked to Medicare records and the National Death Index. These latter datasets vary in terms of the extent of the population they capture and the range and type of sociodemographic and health variables they include. Issues in Combining Public-Use Data and Data From Investigator-Initiated Studies Most reviews have focused on concrete issues of combining data from investigator-initiated studies with public-use data (Brenner, Schmidtmann, and Stegmaier 1997   ; Howe 1998   ; Lillard and Farmer 1997   ; Lipowski and Bigelow 1996   ; Potosky et al. 1993   ; Roos, Walld, Wajda, Bond, and Hartford 1996   ). These issues include the mechanics of linking an existing dataset to Medicare or Medicaid records (Lillard and Farmer 1997   ; Lipowski and Bigelow 1996   ) and involve problems that arise when there are multiple persons with the same name or Medicare number (Brenner et al. 1997   ; Howe 1998   ) and decisions when data may be in both Medicare and Medicaid files when an elderly person is eligible for both (Lipowski and Bigelow 1996   ). Respondents from the investigator's dataset might be missing from the public-use dataset that is the source of follow-up data because of respondents moving out of the geographic area covered by the public-use dataset (Adams et al. 1997   ; Howe 1998   ), a change in personal identifiers (Brenner et al. 1997   ; Lillard and Farmer 1997   ), incomplete personal identifiers (Adams et al. 1997   ; Brenner et al. 1997   ), reporting or coding errors (Brenner et al. 1997   ; Howe 1998   ; Lillard and Farmer 1997   ), or use of health services that are not covered by Medicare, for example (Lillard and Farmer 1997   ; Lu-Yao et al. 1996   ). These concrete problems may differ according to the source of the investigator's dataset and the type of outcome dataset. For example, linking outcome data to a cohort of persons with a particular disease, such as persons identified in a cancer registry, incurs different difficulties than combining data with a cohort of community-dwelling elderly persons. Likewise, problems encountered in linking an investigator's dataset to mortality data differ from those encountered in connecting to data on functional status or health care utilization.Investigators who have data on the respondent's name, birthdate, and address may link to mortality data from the National Death Index or state-based records. However, linking to other datasets necessitates collecting specific information, such as social security numbers to link to Medicare data. Investigators who anticipate adding respondent-level data from external sources should include this information in a letter of consent for respondents.Conceptual issues of combining investigator-initiated studies with public-use datasets are inherently connected to these procedural issues, which affect the research questions that may be asked, features of the comparison group, and the ability to control for potential confounders.The research questions that may be addressed are constrained by the options for linking investigators' and public-use datasets. Most investigator-initiated studies may be linked to mortality data from the National Death Index or state-based records. These linkages are more feasible than linkages to health care utilization datasets because there is only one outcome, mortality, as opposed to multiple outcomes. By adding mortality data on their respondents, investigators can evaluate factors associated with survival in their sample, or whether survival is better in their sample than an external cohort, such as same-aged residents from their state. Such comparisons have been made in investigations of suicide among psychiatric patients (Tsuang 1978   ), mortality following hip fracture (Magaziner et al. 1997   ), and an evaluation of the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Kotelchuck, Schwartz, Anderka, and Finison 1984   ).Datasets that contain longitudinal measures of functional and health status may be combined not only with mortality and health care utilization records, but also with datasets of nationally representative samples or specific populations. These linkages allow investigators to evaluate the relative risk of specific health outcomes and longitudinal changes in functional and health status over time in their cohort versus the comparison cohort. An example of this method is our study on functional health decline that combined a cohort of patients hospitalized for hip fracture with data from the EPESE study, described later. Using the public-use dataset to create a comparison group allowed us to answer more research questions than we could have addressed if we had only used a public-use dataset to add outcome data on individuals in our cohort, but it also introduced a greater possibility for confounding and bias of the results. Furthermore, the decision of which public-use dataset to merge with the investigator's dataset depends on whether the public-use dataset contains the outcome of interest, measures key variables using the same method, and has follow-up intervals of similar lengths.Another conceptual issue in creating either external or internal comparison groups from a public-use dataset is whether the comparison group is appropriate, that is, assuming that the investigator's cohort is "exposed" to a health care program or a disease, does the comparison group represent the experience that the "exposed" cohort would have had if they had not been exposed (Rothman and Greenland 1998   ). For example, would the EPESE cohort represent the experience of elderly patients hospitalized for hip fracture, had they not fractured a hip? Clearly, certain public-use datasets would make appropriate comparison groups for community-dwelling samples, and others would be better for samples of residents in long-term care facilities.The investigator's exposed sample and the public-use unexposed sample may have different distributions of important factors related to the outcome, such as age, existing illnesses, or social support. As a result, the comparison of the samples may introduce confounding of the association between the exposure and the outcome. Potential confounding may be minimized by restricting the analyses to subsets of the two datasets that have similar distributions (such as persons aged 75 and older) or by matching on one or more variables, as described in our example of merging the hip fracture and EPESE cohorts. The latter ensures equal distributions of the variables in the two datasets that were matched. Whether or not matching is used, the investigator also may adjust statistically to reduce or eliminate confounding.Bias resulting from misclassification of outcomes may also occur. This could happen because claims datasets, such as Medicare and Medicaid, might classify a person for reimbursement purposes in a way that differs from how that person would be classified for research purposes (Lipowski and Bigelow 1996   ). Additionally, persons might be absent from Medicare files because they received a treatment that was not reimbursed by Medicare or was covered by a different health plan, such as some treatments for prostate cancer (Lu-Yao et al. 1996   ). Moreover, when investigators link their datasets with registries, matching errors may occur because of coding errors, resulting in mistakenly linking two different persons or missing a correct link between the two datasets (Brenner et al. 1997   ).In summary, when combining investigator-initiated data with public-use data, one must consider not only the procedural issues of merging these datasets, but also conceptual issues such as effects on the validity of the study results. Comparison of Methods to Combine Investigator-Initiated and Public-Use Datasets Next, we compare the three methods of linking investigator-initiated studies to public-use datasets with regard to the type of public-use data, outcome measures, statistical analyses, and advantages and limitations (see  Table 1  ). External Comparisons Epidemiologists have used public-use datasets to provide external comparisons to investigators' studies, such as studies of mortality rates in industrial workers versus those in the general population (Grayson and Lyons 1996   ; Roscoe 1997   ). Similarly, disease rates in particular cohorts have been compared with those in general populations, such as the health status of caregivers compared with that of community-dwelling adults (George and Gwyther 1986   ; Pruchno et al. 1990   ). Benefits of using public-use datasets for external comparisons are that the methods are relatively quick and inexpensive to implement, the external sample is usually well characterized and known, variables are well defined, and established methods exist for computing standardized mortality ratios and for comparing rates of other outcomes.However, using public-use datasets for external comparisons has drawbacks. These studies can only evaluate rates. The public-use sample may have different characteristics from the investigator's sample. Public-use samples of community-dwelling elderly persons may be healthier than the investigator's sample. They are not necessarily a "clean" comparison group in that they may include persons who have the condition that defined eligibility for the investigator's sample. For example, in studies comparing caregivers to community-based samples, the community-based samples may include persons who are caregivers but who were not so identified. External comparisons allow adjustment for just a few confounders simultaneously, such as age and sex, which may lead to biased results due to factors that were not controlled, such as health status. Appending Data We define appending data as adding individual-level data from a public-use dataset to the individual participants in the investigator's dataset. Many studies have added mortality data (Adams et al. 1997   ; Brenner et al. 1997   ; Howe 1998   ) and health care utilization and mortality from Medicare files (Lillard and Farmer 1997   ; Lu-Yao et al. 1996   ; Newschaffer et al. 1998   ). The addition of these data extends the range of outcomes and research questions that can be addressed. Other benefits are that these public-use datasets are comprehensive, so few participants are likely to have missing outcomes; the investigator can adjust for confounding because the investigator's dataset contains information on baseline confounders.Limitations in appending data come from errors in matching the respondent from the investigator's sample to a record in the public-use dataset. Previous reviews have noted that personal identifiers, such as social security numbers, are not always unique (Brenner et al. 1997   ; Howe 1998   ). Outcome data might be missing for respondents who moved to another state and were not documented in the state registry (Howe 1998   ). The data quality has been questioned in datasets that were collected for administrative rather than research purposes: biases may be inherent in the coding protocols. For example, outcome data may be misclassified if the Medicare record lists hospitalization for one condition when another existing condition was the outcome of interest. Appending public-use data does not solve the problem of the lack of a comparison group; this is not the purpose of this method. Exceptions are studies by Wolinsky and colleagues in which pseudo-dates of disease onset were generated for a comparison group created within the Longitudinal Study on Aging (Wolinsky, Fitzgerald, and Stump 1997   ). In summary, appending data from public-use datasets allows investigators to evaluate risk of mortality and other outcomes more efficiently than if they had to recontact respondents or their proxies to collect follow-up data, but possible limitations are missing data for some participants and misclassification of some outcomes. Merging Datasets Merging an investigator's sample with data from public-use datasets has pragmatic benefits. Investigators might not have included a comparison group in the original study because it was too expensive or because the outcome was rare so that a large comparison group or long follow-up period would have been needed. Other reasons are that the data collection methods might be considered too invasive by potential control participants or that it was difficult to identify an appropriate and accessible comparison group. For example, by merging a dataset of elderly women with incident breast cancer identified through the Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare data on these women and on elderly, female Virginia residents, Newschaffer and colleagues created a comparison group of women who were hospitalized for genital prolapse and obtained data on covariables and outcomes for all respondents (Newschaffer et al. 1998   ).Benefits of merging an investigator-initiated sample with a public-use dataset are that a single dataset is created and that there is no need for specific information on respondents, such as social security number. The investigator can quantify differences in sample characteristics between the two datasets, control for confounders, evaluate effect modification, and perform complex statistical analyses.However, finding appropriate datasets to merge with an investigator's dataset may be difficult. Reasons may include differences in the distribution of key variables and sample characteristics; different data collection methods, such as different scales to measure cognitive impairment or different response options on similar measures; and different decisions about coding responses and missing data. The follow-up intervals may also differ: If the investigator's study has follow-up at 6-month intervals and the public-use dataset has follow-up at annual intervals, the rate of health decline over 12 months is not necessarily the same as that over a 6-month period. We encountered these challenges in merging the hip fracture dataset with the EPESE dataset. Investigators may minimize these problems at the design phase by using standardized measures and follow-up intervals that are used in existing public-use datasets. Example: A Study of Hip Fracture Outcome We combined data from an investigator-initiated study with public-use data to evaluate whether elderly patients hospitalized for hip fracture had more decline in functional limitations over a 2-year period than community-dwelling elderly adults. Methods Samples The investigator-initiated sample included 674 community-dwelling adults, aged 65 years and older, who were admitted to eight Baltimore hospitals in 1990–91 and followed for 2 years (Magaziner et al. 2000   ). All elderly patients admitted to these hospitals for hip fracture during 1990–91 were eligible for this study. Data were collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires in face-to-face interviews at the time of hospitalization and at 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months posthospitalization.The EPESE dataset included prospective data on adults aged 65 years and older living in three communities: East Boston, MA (n = 3,809), Iowa (n = 3,673), and New Haven, CT (n = 2,812; the dataset did not contain prospective data on respondents from the Durham, NC, site). Participants had annual interviews in 1982, 1983, and 1984 and were asked questions on functional status and health. Interviews were conducted face-to-face at baseline and by telephone at 12- and 24-month follow-up. We did not exclude persons with previous hip fractures because the hip cohort included persons who had had previous fractures.The EPESE cohort appeared well suited to merge with the hip fracture cohort because of the similar age range, time between interviews, and similar key variables. Although the EPESE study began 8 years before the hip fracture study, we assumed that a comparison group of community-dwelling elderly persons from the 1980s would not differ substantially from older adults in 1990 with regard to their rate of change in functional status over a 2-year period. Hip Fracture Study Variables At each interview, respondents were asked whether they received help performing each of 16 physical activities of daily living (ADLs) during the past week and how difficult it was to perform each activity. Baseline was considered the week before hospitalization. These questions were modeled after items on the Functional State Index (Jette 1987   ) and the Katz ADL scale (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffee 1963   ) and additional questions on activities related to lower extremity function. Being able to dress oneself was separated into four activities: put on a shirt/blouse; button a shirt/blouse; put on pants; and put socks and shoes on both feet. Taking a bath/shower was separated into two activities: getting in/out of a bath or shower; and taking a shower, bath, or sponge bath.Covariables included in these analyses were the respondent's age at baseline, sex, history of stroke, and presence of four other potentially disabling medical conditions: diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease. Information on other comorbid conditions was collected, but these were the conditions that were also measured in the EPESE study. EPESE Study Variables At baseline and follow-up interviews, respondents were asked three questions on mobility functioning from the Rosow-Breslau scale (Rosow and Breslau 1966   ; ability to do heavy work around the house, walk half a mile, and walk up and down stairs without help) and seven questions on ADL limitations modified from the Katz ADL scale (Katz et al. 1963   ). These questions were on limitations in walking across a small room, getting from bed to chair, eating, dressing, grooming, bathing, and using the toilet. A variety of covariables on sociodemographic and health status were assessed (Cornoni-Huntley et al. 1986   ). For our analyses, we selected those covariables that were listed previously for the hip fracture cohort. Decisions Regarding the Choice of ADL Variables The questions on ADL limitations were not worded exactly the same in the two studies. For walking indoors, hip fracture patients were asked, "In the past week, on average, did you receive help to walk 10 feet or across a room?" Response options were as follows: received no help, used help from equipment or a person, or was unable to walk across a room. The EPESE participants were asked, "Was there any time in the past 12 months in which you needed help from some person or from some equipment or device walking across a small room?" Response options were as follows: does not need help, gets help, or is unable to walk across a small room. We remedied these differences by creating the same dichotomous response for each question: unable to walk across a room versus other. Questions on transfer also differed somewhat. The hip fracture respondents were asked, "In the past week, on average, did you receive help getting in and out of bed?" EPESE respondents were asked if there was any time in the past year that they needed help "getting from a bed to a chair." We made no adjustment for the different reference periods—past week or past year—of the limitation.We selected five ADL questions that were similarly worded: walking across a room, transferring, bathing, grooming, and eating. We constructed a single dressing question from four items on the hip fracture questionnaire. No other ADL questions were similar enough to include. Decisions regarding the choice of covariables Age was operationalized in 5-year age groups because the EPESE dataset included these groups instead of a continuous variable for age. Cognitive status was not included as a covariable because it was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the hip fracture study and by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in the EPESE dataset. We considered making a dichotomous variable (cognitively impaired, yes or no) based on each of these measures, but we concluded that there would be interpretation problems because of differences between these measures. Results The hip fracture cohort was older, more likely to be female, and more likely to include participants who had had strokes than each of the EPESE cohorts (see  Table 2  ). Almost 60% of the hip fracture cohort was 80 years or older, versus 20–24% of the EPESE cohorts. Furthermore, hip fracture respondents were more likely than EPESE respondents to report limitations in walking across a room, transferring, bathing, and toileting at baseline, that is, before they were hospitalized for hip fracture.Because of these differences, we considered restricting our analyses to respondents who were aged 75 years and older. However, discrepancies remained between the two samples: among persons aged 75 years and older, the EPESE sample was younger and less functionally impaired at baseline than the hip fracture sample. Instead, we used frequency matching of each of the EPESE cohorts to the hip fracture cohort on three baseline variables simultaneously—5-year age group, sex, and ability to walk across a room—to force the samples to be similar on these variables and reduce potential confounding in a way that was less restrictive than pair-matching (Kleinbaum, Kupper, and Morgenstern 1982   ). By frequency matching, we created three groups of "unexposed" individuals, each group approximately the same size as the hip fracture group. Table 3  shows that frequency matching on these variables resulted in four samples of 594 respondents each, with equal distributions of age and sex (because we matched on those factors). The distributions of walking across a room, transferring, and grooming were alike. Compared with the unmatched samples, there were smaller differences in the distribution of stroke between the hip fracture and EPESE samples. However, the distribution of limitations in bathing and dressing still differed across cohorts.Our preliminary results indicated that with matching and controlling for important baseline covariables, hip fracture patients had an increased risk of impairment in walking across a room, transferring, and grooming at 1 and 2 years posthospitalization, compared with community-dwelling elderly adults. When adjusted for covariables, 26% of each sample was limited in walking across a room at baseline. At 1-year follow-up, 54% of hip fracture patients were limited in ability to walk across a room, versus about 20% of each of the EPESE cohorts. At 2 years, about 54% of hip fracture patients had limitations walking across the room, whereas the proportion in each of the EPESE cohorts had returned to about 26%.If we had used the EPESE dataset as an external comparison group and adjusted for age and sex only in each unmatched sample, the proportion of respondents with limitations walking across a room at 1 year would have been 53% in the unmatched hip fracture cohort, 10% in the East Boston, 9% in the Iowa, and 11% in the New Haven EPESE cohorts. These results would have been confounded by the younger age and better health of the EPESE versus the hip fracture samples.We also could have used each unmatched EPESE sample as a "standard population" to calculate the proportion of hip fracture respondents with walking limitations as if this cohort had the age–sex distribution of each EPESE sample. This would reduce confounding because of unequal age–sex distributions between the two cohorts. If we had done this, the proportion of hip fracture respondents with walking limitations at 1 year would have ranged from 42% using the East Boston sample to 44% using the Iowa sample. Discussion We compared three methods of linking data from investigator-initiated studies to public-use data. Each method has pragmatic and conceptual advantages and disadvantages. Our study of functional decline following hip fracture showed benefits and drawbacks of merging data from an investigator-initiated study with a public-use dataset. Because we merged these datasets, our results were less confounded by differences in the age and health distributions of the hip fracture and EPESE samples than if we had used the EPESE samples as external comparison groups and adjusted only for age and sex within each dataset. Limitations of this method were that our choice of outcome variables, covariables, and follow-up intervals was constrained by the design of the EPESE dataset, as would be the case with the use of any public-use dataset.In addition, the matched samples were not representative of their target populations. This posed more of a problem for the hip fracture sample than the EPESE samples: The latter samples were intended to create comparison cohorts to imitate the hip fracture cohort, had they not fractured a hip. The matched hip fracture cohort was unrepresentative of its target population because 80 of the original 674 respondents were excluded because of the absence of an age–sex match in the EPESE samples. These respondents were older and frailer than those who were included. The observed results probably underestimated the true differences in functional decline that would have been observed had these 80 respondents been included in our analyses. If these respondents had a different rate of functional decline than the respondents who remained in our analysis, selection bias might have occurred. Thus, our results should be interpreted with caution.Our results also must be interpreted in light of the data collection methods in the EPESE study. Data were collected by face-to-face interview at baseline and by telephone at 12 and 24 months. This variation in methods might have accounted for some of the change observed between 12 and 24 months in the proportion of EPESE respondents who reported limitations in walking across a room. We could have avoided this problem by excluding 12-month outcome data, but we included it to better portray functional decline following hip fracture.In conclusion, linking investigator-initiated datasets to public-use data is a relatively low-cost method to expand researchers' datasets. The determining factor in combining datasets is how similar the public-use data are to the investigator-initiated data. Linking to public-use datasets increases the range of questions that researchers can answer, and it may be used to create comparison groups for addressing complex associations when a comparison group might be too difficult or expensive to recruit or for program evaluations where randomized trials are unethical or too cumbersome to perform.

     Abstract Purpose: This analysis describes media coverage of long-term care in 1998. Design and Methods: Several sources were used to place coverage of long-term care in 1998 in the context of recent years and other health issues. For the primary analysis, stories in which long-term care was a major topic were collected from Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe. Media sources included major newspapers, network news, CNN, and NPR. Stories were coded for topic, details about the topic, physical placement within the overall coverage, and underlying issues. Results: A small percentage of media coverage in 1998 concerned long-term care. Among long-term care topics, nursing homes received the most coverage. A small percentage of long-term care topics were reported on the front page, and few underlying issues framed these topics. Implications:To ensure that Americans receive a comprehensive view of long-term care issues, gerontologists must work with reporters to influence how they report on long-term care.   Politics ,  Health policy ,  Aging ,  Public opinion ,  Knowledge Laurence G. Branch, PhDAn issue of ongoing debate among gerontologists and policymakers concerns government funding for institutional and community-based long-term care services. Many experts and advocates have argued for increased government support for home and community-based alternatives to institutional care. Although government funding for home-based care has increased in recent years, institutional care continues to receive the large majority of funding. In 1998, 73% of the $48.5 billion that the federal government spent on long-term care went to nursing homes. Nearly 90% of the $20.1 billion that state and local governments spent on long-term care in the same year went to nursing homes (Health Care Financing Administration, 1999).One argument for increasing government support for community-based care is the fact that a large majority of Americans aged 45 and older (86%) have expressed a desire to avoid an institutional setting when they need help taking care of themselves (AARP 2000   ). Additionally, a large majority of adults aged 70 years and older who believe they may need long-term care in the coming year (76%) do not have the personal resources to pay for care. A similar proportion of the general public is concerned about how they will finance long-term care for themselves and their spouses (Harvard School of Public Health and Louis Harris and Associates 1995   ; National Council on Aging and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company 1999   ). Given this combination of factors, why is there no public outcry for more government funding of home and community-based care?One explanation involves Americans' lack of knowledge about long-term care alternatives. A majority of Americans believe that most long-term care is provided in nursing homes. In fact, about 80% of long-term care is provided by friends and family members at home. Additionally, two thirds of all Americans cannot pass a quiz with simple questions about the costs and financing of long-term care (National Council on Aging and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company 1999   ). The most recent survey to extensively measure the public's knowledge of available long-term care services showed that even older Americans are unfamiliar with a variety of long-term care services. A sizable minority of adults aged 50 years and older (28%) had not heard of or read about home health care. About 41% of these adults had not heard of adult day care or congregate living, and 47% had not heard of assisted living arrangements. Conversely, most adults aged 50 years and older (82%) had heard of or read about skilled nursing facilities (Harvard School of Public Health and Louis Harris and Associates 1995   ). Finally, in a recent series of focus groups, older Americans tended to focus on nursing home experiences, and most of them remained unfamiliar with community-based long-term care services (G. Wright, AARP, personal communication, May 16, 2000).Although future surveys are likely to show that the public's familiarity with long-term care services has increased with the recent growth in long-term care services, millions of Americans are likely to be unfamiliar with most long-term care services. Americans are not likely to demand services that they do not know about, and they are not likely to support policies involving services that are not familiar.Growing demand for long-term care services and continued budgetary pressures to curb health care spending ensure that the debate about what forms of long-term care should be supported by government, and to what extent, will not abate in the near future. As policies concerning long-term care evolve, it is critical for policymakers, health care providers, and researchers to understand what information is influencing the public's knowledge, priorities, and attitudes about long-term care policy.This study is the first to examine what information about long-term care is conveyed to the public by a major source of health information: news media. In 1998, two thirds of Americans (68%) regularly read a daily newspaper. Fifty-seven percent of Americans regularly watched network news programs, and 38% watched national nightly news on CBS, NBC, or ABC. Forty percent of Americans regularly watch one of the cable news networks, and 23% regularly watch the Cable News Network (CNN). Finally, about one half of Americans (52%) regularly listen to news on the radio, and 15% regularly listen to National Public Radio (NPR; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 1998   ).According to the Pew Research Center's reported tabulations for selected programs, in 1998 older Americans were more likely than younger Americans to regularly watch nightly network news and CNN and were just as likely to listen regularly to NPR. Nearly one half of Americans aged 50–64 years (49%) regularly watch nightly news on CBS, ABC, or NBC. Fifty-five percent of people aged 65 years and older regularly watch nightly news on these networks. By comparison, 23% of people aged 18–29 years and 33% of people aged 30–49 years regularly watch nightly news on these networks. Similarly, 28% of people aged 50–64 years and 30% of adults aged 65 years and older regularly watch CNN. Sixteen and 21% of people aged 18–29 and 30–49 years, respectively, regularly watch CNN. Finally, about 15% of all of the age groups regularly listen to NPR.A similar study shows that a sizable percentage of all Americans (40%) rely on television as their primary source of health and medical news. For older Americans, dependence on television for health and medical news varies. Forty-three percent of Americans aged 50–59 years rely on television as their primary source of health-related news, compared with about one third of Americans aged 60 years and older. Similarly, 16% of all Americans most often get health-related news from daily newspapers. Among older Americans, 19% of 50–59-year-olds and 12% of adults aged 60 years and older fall into this category. Finally, 4% of the general public and older Americans rely on radio news as their primary source for this type of information (National Health Council 1997   ). For the millions of Americans who watch, read, or listen to news, do media influence how they view long-term care services and policy, and if so, how?Measuring media's impact on the public's knowledge of and attitudes toward issues is a difficult task. Media messages are among myriad influences on a person's cognitive processes as he or she collects information about an issue and makes decisions about the importance of an issue, how societal issues should be addressed, and so forth. Despite these difficulties, researchers have presented convincing evidence suggesting that media messages are received and processed by audiences and can influence audiences' priorities, perceptions of political life and political actors, and attributions of responsibility for social problems.One impact media may have on the public's conception of long-term care problems and concerns relates to media's selection of newsworthy issues. For individuals who have limited free time and interest in the full range of societal issues, media coverage focuses attention on the long-term care issues that are reported.A considerable amount of research suggests that how media report newsworthy issues also sends cues that influence audiences' views of national affairs. For example, people are more likely to notice and remember stories placed in the front of media coverage or stories that receive lengthy coverage (Behr and Iyengar 1985   ; Graber 1988   ; Smith 1992   ). Additionally, numerous studies and experiments have shown that among issues reported by media, issues that receive a large volume of coverage tend to be more salient with the public (e.g., Cohen 1963   ; Eaton 1989   ; Iyengar and Kinder 1987   ; Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder 1982   ; McCombs and Shaw 1972   ; Rogers, Dearing, and Chang 1991   ). This evidence suggests that the presentation of media coverage influences what issues the public considers to be the top issues facing the nation.Not only does media coverage affect which issues reach the public agenda and their importance once there, how media frame issues (i.e., discusses causes, effects, etc.) affects what attributes of national issues become part of public discourse and expectations. For example, one experiment demonstrated that when media stories direct attention to poverty as a national outcome or on national programs addressing the issue, the audience's explanations for poverty focus on societal factors such as national economic conditions that lead to fewer available jobs; when media focus on examples of individual poor people, explanations for poverty focus on individual characteristics such as a lack of education and job skills (Iyengar 1987   ). Other studies provide supporting evidence for using various national issues as examples, including the economy and racial inequality (Benton and Frazier 1976   ; Iyengar 1991   ). Knowing how media are framing long-term care issues will provide valuable insights for policymakers because the public's attributions of responsibility for the causes or treatment of national issues shape their preferences for public policy (Iyengar 1987   , Iyengar 1989   ).To understand better the public's knowledge and views of long-term care services in a recent year, I addressed several key questions in this study. First, when long-term care was the focus of a news story in 1998, what topics were reported and what aspects of these topics were discussed? Second, which long-term care topics were emphasized with prominent placement in media coverage in 1998? Finally, what problems or new information was used to frame the long-term care topics reported in 1998? Methods Data Sources One of the datasets used in this analysis to describe long-term care coverage was the number of stories that included long-term care terms in each year from 1995 to 1999. (See  Appendix , Note 1, for a complete list of search terms.) For these yearly counts, the long-term care terms had to be included in the headline or first paragraph(s) of the story. Also, these results describe the unfiltered data, which include letters to the editor, obituaries, news about other countries or in non-U.S. papers, talk show discussions, stories presented as abstracts, later publication of the same story, advice columns, and stories featuring words not related to long-term care (e.g., senior center, a term used in the search, may refer to someone playing center on a basketball team). Assuming that the percentage of extraneous stories does not change significantly each year, the unfiltered data provide an indication of how the volume of long-term care stories has changed in the past 5 years.I searched several Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe databases in May 2000 to provide the unfiltered data for different news media. For print media, the Major Newspapers database was examined. This database includes U.S. papers from every region of the country that were in the top 50 in circulation in the Editor & Publisher International Yearbook in each year. Newspapers published outside the United States must be written in English and listed as a newspaper in Benn's Media directory or one of the top 5% in circulation for the country. When the searches were conducted, the database included 43 major newspapers, with 29 of them based in the United States. (See  Appendix , Note 2, for a list of sources.)The broadcast media stories were obtained from the Transcripts database. These sources include three of the major networks (NBC, ABC, and CBS), one cable news network (CNN), and one major source of radio news (NPR).For each year between 1995 and 1999, the three news stories that were closely followed by the largest percentages of the public are also presented. These data were gathered from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press (2000) report titled Public Attentiveness to Major News Stories: 1986–1999.To compare long-term care coverage in 1998 with coverage of other stories in 1998, I analyzed story headlines reported daily to media outlets as TV Track (compiled by U.S. Newswire) to determine the topics broadcast by CBS, NBC, and ABC on Monday through Friday. I used the Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe Transcripts database to compare the number of long-term care stories in NPR, CNN, and the major newspapers with a measure of the total number of health-related stories. I added the term health care to the long-term care terms to collect stories about a broader range of health issues. Again, the terms were included in the title or first paragraph(s) of each story and the resulting data include non-U.S. sources, talk shows, and so forth. Finally, the Kaiser/Harvard Health News Index provided an indication of the top health stories the public followed in 1998.The primary results from this analysis are based on data from the Lexis-Nexis Academic Major Newspapers and Transcripts databases as described previously. The data were collected and coded from March to June 1999. Media sources included 29 U.S. newspapers, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and NPR.For each source, all of the stories produced throughout 1998 and containing words related to long-term care in the headline or first paragraph(s) (11,224 stories) were briefly examined. Letters to the editor, obituaries, news about other countries or in non-U.S. papers, talk show discussions, later publication of the same story, and advice columns were not included in these final data. To narrow the data to stories that were most likely to have an impact on the public, I also excluded articles if long-term care was not discussed in at least one third of the story. The resulting 1,380 news stories (1,331 newspaper stories, 29 stories from the three networks, 9 stories from CNN, and 11 stories from NPR) represent news coverage throughout 1998 that focused on long-term care. For the major newspapers, 22 of the 29 newspapers provided stories for the final analysis. (See  Appendix , Note 3, for a list of the 22 major newspapers that provided stories for this analysis.)One aim of this exploratory analysis was to compare media coverage of a variety of long-term care services. The emphasis on 1 year of media coverage rather than on samples of coverage from several years allowed for a complete examination of topics that are reported infrequently. Coding Methodology Weber 1990    describes content analysis as a research method used by numerous types of social scientists to make valid inferences from communications, including speeches, historic documents, open-ended interviews, dialog between physicians and patients, news stories, entertainment programs, and so forth. Although the rules of this inferential process vary depending on theoretical and substantive interests, the central idea is to classify the many words of the communication into much fewer content categories.This content analysis focused on four simple elements of each long-term care story. The first element was the primary topic. At least one third of the story had to refer to the topic for it to be considered primary. The second element was the secondary topic. This variable captured what aspect of the primary topic was the focus of the story. The coder began with a list of likely topics for these two elements that expanded as new topics emerged from the data.The third element highlighted which long-term care newspaper articles likely had the most impact on public attitudes. Along with other objective characteristics of the story, such as date published and media organization, the page number for each story was recorded. All stories with the page numbers 1, 1A, A1, and A01 were coded as having been published on the front page of the first section of the newspaper. This method of accounting likely missed long-term care stories published on the front page of separate health or medical sections.To determine how media framed or explained long-term care issues, which was the fourth element, each story was coded for up to three mentions of broader problems or underlying issues related to the primary topic. Again, the coder began with a list of likely explanations that was expanded to include all underlying issues reported throughout 1998. (This variable was not coded for the 34 abstracts describing The Wall Street Journal stories because they did not provide enough information.)Although the coder was given instructions on how to define each variable and was trained and evaluated to ensure consistency, the results are subject to human error. To test intercoder reliability of the coding, the full texts of 10% of the newspaper articles were also coded by a second coder. Intercoder agreement rates were 89% or greater for all analyzed variables. All of the broadcast stories were coded by two coders, and any discrepancies were resolved by the author. Results Volume of Long-Term Care Coverage in 1998 Unfiltered counts of stories in major U.S. and foreign newspapers showed that 1998 was at the beginning of an upswing in long-term care mentions ( Fig. 1 ). In the past 5 years, 1997 had the lowest number of newspaper stories mentioning long-term care (10,197). In 1998, that number increased to 11,224, and in 1999, 11,953 stories mentioned long-term care.For broadcast media, the number of long-term care mentions in the past 5 years changed in different ways ( Fig. 2 ). For the three networks, the number of long-term care mentions steadily increased from 51 in 1996 to 91 in 1999. For CNN, 1998 had the fewest number of long-term care mentions in the past 5 years with 23. In 1995, regular CNN watchers saw the most long-term care mentions (75) compared with about 50 in 1996, 1997, and 1999. Finally, the number of long-term care mentions on NPR hovered around 40 in the past 5 years. NPR mentioned long-term care 37 times in 1996 and 1998 with a high of 46 times in 1995.Each year, long-term care stories compete with other stories for the public's attention.  Fig. 3  shows the top three stories that the public closely followed in the past 5 years and the percentage of people who closely followed each story (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2000   ). In 4 of the past 5 years, the top story garnered considerably more followers than the next two stories. For example, in 1996, 69% of the public closely followed stories about the TWA crash in July compared with about 56% of the public who closely followed stories about the pipe bomb set at the Olympics held in Atlanta, GA, in July and the presidential election results discussed in December. In 1998, the top story had fewer close followers than top stories in other years, and the second and third most followed stories had similar numbers of followers. In 1998, all of the most closely followed stories related to gun violence. About half of the public closely followed stories about shootings in schools in Jonesboro, AK, and Springfield, OR, in March and June, respectively, and the shooting of a Capitol Hill police officer in July.An analysis of all weekday network news headlines put the volume of long-term care coverage throughout 1998 in the context of other topics covered by ABC, CBS, and NBC. The 17 long-term care news stories broadcast on Monday through Friday by the three networks represented about 3% of the 590 health- and medical-related stories and less than 1% of all news stories broadcast during the week ( Table 1  ).Throughout 1998, long-term care stories were a larger percentage of stories about health care for NPR and CNN than for the network news sources. About 41% of health care stories on NPR and 22% of CNN stories about health care were about long-term care. For the major newspapers, long-term care stories were about 12% of all of their stories about health care.Despite considerable news coverage in newspapers and on CNN and NPR, long-term care was not one of the top health-related issues that the public followed in 1998 (Kaiser/Harvard Program on the Public and Health Policy 1998   ). Stories about tobacco (antismoking legislation in May and a possible legal settlement in November), the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, AL, in January, and the hope for a cure for cancer in May were the top three general health stories that the public closely followed. The top three health policy stories the public closely followed were President Clinton's proposed changes to Medicare in January, consumer protection legislation for people in HMOs/managed care in July, and reports about HMOs and other health plans pulling out of Medicare in September and October.The primary focus of this analysis was the 1,380 stories that focused on long-term care topics that were published and broadcast by the major newspapers and broadcast media throughout 1998. Both CNN and NPR averaged about 1 long-term care news story per month. Twenty-two of the major U.S. newspapers averaged about 60 stories focusing on long-term care stories per year. A regular reader of one of these major newspapers could have read about 5 long-term care stories each month. Including the seven major U.S. newspapers that did not have a story that focused on long-term care as defined in this study, the average number of long-term care stories published each month became 4.The volume of long-term care media coverage tends to ebb and flow throughout the year in response to the occurrence of newsworthy events and editorial choices concerning which news should be reported and how much. For example, readers of 22 major U.S. newspapers saw the most number of articles about long-term care (134) in October of 1998. The Boston Globe (Massachusetts) and the St. Petersburg Times (Florida) had the largest number of articles in October with 19 and 18, respectively. For both of these papers, more than 80% of the long-term care stories concerned local health care providers and elderly citizens rather than national policy. In comparison, the number of network news stories about long-term care peaked in July at 16. Ten of these stories were prompted by an investigation into the quality of care in California nursing homes and a White House report highlighting nursing home abuse that led to hearings in Congress and proposals from President Clinton for addressing the problems. CBS dominated the network coverage of long-term care in July with 10 stories, 6 of which were about abusive care in nursing homes. Nursing Homes Were the Most Covered Long-Term Care Topic in 1998 Nursing homes were the primary topic for the largest percentage of long-term care stories in 1998 for each of the media sources ( Table 2  ). The network news had the highest percentage of long-term care stories about nursing homes with 76% of their 29 stories, followed by 64% of NPR's 11 stories and 56% of CNN's 9 stories. Thirty-eight percent of the 1,331 newspaper articles about long-term care were about nursing homes.The second most covered long-term care topic varied by media type. After nursing homes, no one particular topic dominated long-term care coverage for the broadcast media. Home health care was the focus of 18% of NPR's long-term care coverage, and multiple topics, such as assisted living facilities and long-term care insurance, tied for second place in percentage of coverage by the network news and CNN. For major newspapers, assisted living facilities and home health care were the next most covered topics with 18% and 16% of the coverage, respectively.For two of the media sources, one element of the primary topic was highlighted in about half of the coverage ( Table 3  ). Fifty-two percent of the long-term care coverage in major newspapers reported business-related elements, such as mergers or hiring practices. Fifty-six percent of the CNN coverage highlighted quality-of-care issues concerning the primary topic. Quality of care and other issues coded as miscellaneous were the elements of interest for 38% and 31% of the network news coverage, respectively. The NPR coverage did not tend to focus on any one aspect of the primary topics.With the exception of the network news organizations, the elements that media emphasized in nursing home coverage differed from those highlighted for the other long-term care topics. Only 38% of the newspaper coverage of nursing homes reported on business-related elements. Quality of care and cases in the justice system, such as crimes or lawsuits, were the elements of interest for 23% and 19% of newspaper coverage of nursing homes, respectively. For CNN, all of the nursing home coverage related to quality-of-care issues. Issues related to choosing the proper long-term care facility were the most discussed element of nursing homes on NPR, with 43% of the coverage. Long-Term Care Topics on the Front Page in 1998 In 1998, 12% of all newspaper coverage of long-term care topics was featured on the front page ( Table 4  ). For each of the three long-term care topics most often covered, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health care, the percentage of each topic's coverage that was reported on the front page ranged from 11% to 13%. None of the long-term care topics covered in 1998 garnered more than 20% of coverage on the front page. The Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe database did not include the necessary information to extend this analysis to the other news mediums. Underlying Issues Framing Long-Term Care Topics in 1998 Throughout the coverage of long-term care topics in 1998, up to one third of stories presented by each type of media framed long-term care issues within the context of underlying issues ( Table 5  ). Six percent of the newspaper stories about long-term care mentioned the broader issue of the aging population in connection with the long-term care topic. Twenty-one percent of the network news and 27% of the NPR coverage framed long-term care topics with the expected boom in the number of older Americans. Several underlying issues, such as a shortage of labor in markets for long-term care services or the high costs of long-term care, were the most used frames for CNN long-term care coverage. Finally, one third of CNN's long-term care stories described miscellaneous underlying issues that did not fit into the other categories, such as the lack of private or public insurance coverage for daily, nonmedical care for people suffering from ailments like Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Discussion To help explain the public's knowledge and views of long-term care issues, this study provides insight into what information about long-term care the public recently received from news media. Although long-term care coverage throughout 1998 is the primary focus of this study, the analysis begins by putting the 1998 coverage in the context of media coverage in the past 5 years.Unfiltered counts of any mention of long-term care indicate that 1998 may be the beginning of an upward trend in media coverage of long-term care. With the exception of CNN, the volume of long-term care coverage in 1998 is likely indicative of the volume in recent years.A look at the top stories closely followed by the public in the past 5 years shows that although the specific stories differ each year, the trend is the same. No health-related story was the most followed story in any year since 1995.Assuming that the public's attention to a story is influenced by its volume of media coverage, the relatively low levels of attention for the top three issues in 1998 suggest that there may have been more space for coverage of health issues in 1998. The number of stories closely followed by at least one third of the public suggests that the public closely followed more topics in 1998 than in any year since 1995. In 1998, 16 topics were closely followed by at least a third of the public compared with the next closest year, 1996, in which 12 topics were closely followed by at least one third of the public. However, among the 16 topics closely followed by a third of the public in 1998, including three stories about weather-related events and three stories about aspects of President Clinton's impeachment scandal, none were health related.Looking more specifically at the context of long-term care coverage in 1998 reveals a similar picture. Of the top health-related stories in 1998, none concerned long-term care. By these measures, health-related issues tended not to be the topics that people followed closely, and when they did follow health issues, long-term care did not capture their attention.The public's lack of attention to long-term care topics in the news throughout 1998 may be the result of how long-term care topics were presented to the public. Long-term care events and issues were reported in a small percentage of both health-related coverage and all coverage throughout 1998. Additionally, long-term care topics tended not to be emphasized on the front page of newspaper coverage. By volume and placement, stories about long-term care did not have much opportunity to capture the public's attention throughout 1998.When media did publish or broadcast stories about long-term care, nursing homes were the topic most often featured. Nursing homes attract media attention, in part, because their problems often involve conflict between real people that can be easily described and pictured (Jamieson and Campbell 1992   ). Additionally, a significant amount of government money funds nursing home care compared with other long-term care arrangements that have recently emerged as viable alternatives. The government's focus on the funding and quality of nursing home care and the public's familiarity with local nursing homes ensure that nursing homes will be an issue of ongoing concern for many media organizations.This cycle—which leads from public experience with nursing homes, to media coverage of nursing homes, to public demand for programs and policies concerning nursing homes, to government funding and regulation of nursing homes, to more media coverage of nursing homes, and so on—also helps to ensure that the public's expectations about long-term care policy include solutions to problems with nursing home care. Any strategy for expanding long-term care policy discourse should attempt to generate similar cycles for other types of long-term care services. Suggestions for how gerontologists may play a role in this type of strategy are offered in the following paragraphs.Few of the stories about long-term care discussed the broader context surrounding the topic. This pattern suggests that no single underlying issue, such as rapid market growth or cuts in government funding, is being used to frame the reported long-term care topics. The choice of which context to link to long-term care issues affects how people judge the importance of these issues, whether or not they are willing to support policy action, and which actions they will support. For example, people may be more willing to invest government resources to address a long-term care issue if the problem is linked to conditions beyond anyone's control, such as an aging population, rather than the business practices of health care providers. Watching for the emergence of particular explanations for long-term care issues in media coverage should be an important task for researchers during future policy debates. These results provide a baseline for future trends.The results of this study should be viewed in light of serious consideration of what media coverage of long-term care should entail. Is an average of five newspaper stories a month the "right" amount of coverage for long-term care issues? What is the "right" mix of topics or emphasis on the front page? How should we determine the standard? Should the volume of coverage be compared with other health-related issues? With changes in demand for long-term care services? Solely based on the occurrence of "newsworthy" events? Should coverage reflect the balance of government funding?As markets for long-term care develop and demand increases, now is the time for proponents of community and home-based long-term care alternatives to develop strategies to systematically influence whether or not journalists cover a range of long-term care options and how. Guided by a vigorous debate concerning what the public should know about long-term care and how long-term care should be covered by media, policymakers, researchers, and health care providers should establish professional relationships with journalists who cover long-term care issues. Long-term care experts should "report" research findings and possible stories about long-term care to their journalist colleagues. Researchers and health care professionals should also provide the dreaded "sound-bite" or brief explanation that can provide context to newsworthy events, such as legislative proposals or political debate about Medicare financing. Finally, experts should become involved with organizations, like the Association of Health Care Journalists, that strive toward better coverage of health issues. As a reliable source of information about long-term care issues, experts who direct attention to newsworthy long-term care topics or provide context for long-term care issues in a manner that can easily fit into a news story can influence media coverage of these issues and, ultimately, the public's view of national affairs.This analysis is the first step toward a more comprehensive view of information provided by media and its effect on the public's knowledge and attitudes toward long-term care issues and services. Future research could expand these findings via the following suggestions.A more sophisticated analysis of the content of media coverage of long-term care would lead to a better understanding of the quality of the coverage and what the public can learn from the information. Although parsing news stories into objective categories may not capture the full meaning of the story when the story elements are combined, researchers can examine elements other than the topic of the story (e.g., words used to describe problems and policies, how often stories rely on objective measures of problems, and expert and political sources used to provide context for the story) to gain a better understanding of media messages (see Brodie, Brady, and Altman 1998   ; Colby and Cook 1991   ).Analysis of the text of media stories does not capture all of the information that the viewer or listener gets when watching news on television or listening to news on the radio. A more comprehensive study of broadcast media would also analyze the images and sounds that add meaning to the words that are broadcast (see Jernigan and Dorfman 1996   ).One goal of media communication analysis is to link media messages to public knowledge and attitudes about long-term care. Establishing this link would require a longitudinal study of media coverage, the results of which could be correlated with changes in public knowledge and opinion (see Fan and Norem 1992   ). A longitudinal study of long-term care coverage would also establish trends in coverage that can be monitored.Two additional dimensions can be explored to expand the findings of this study. The first dimension would be an examination of why media cover long-term care as they do. Data for this type of analysis would include interviews with journalists to determine how long-term care stories are generated; a study of long-term care stories provided by wire services that provide stories to media outlets; and an examination of the occurrence of events, problems, research studies, or legislation that could be the impetus for a news story. The second dimension is the link between knowledge that Americans may gain from media and the effect of this knowledge on their behavior. Although evidence linking political knowledge and voting or other political behavior is mixed, there is some indication that people act on health-related information they receive. (For a review of the role of political information, see Bartels 1996   .) More than half of Americans (58%) say that they have changed their behavior or taken an action as a result of having read, seen, or heard a medical or health news story in media (National Health Council 1997   ). This finding suggests that understanding media messages is important for understanding personal health choices as well as the general direction of public policy.Finally, future studies of media presentation of long-term care should explore other news sources, especially local and internet sources, and non-news sources of information that are provided via media. Advertising, music videos, and entertainment shows also provide information and images concerning older Americans that can affect the public's view of long-term care.

     Abstract Purpose: Although several studies have examined the magnitude and prevalence of Medicaid estate planning (MEP), little is known about factors that influence individual behaviors in this area. Normative data regarding public perceptions of and motivations for MEP are nonexistent. This study explored views about MEP among community-dwelling older adults and family caregivers. Design and methods: Eighteen focus groups were completed (N = 155), with a stratified homogeneous sample to ensure representation from individuals of varying race/ethnicity, experience with nursing home and home care services, and socioeconomic status. Analyses of transcripts were completed with NUD*IST 4.0 software. Results: Disincentives for MEP included losing control of one's assets, Medicaid stigma, and perceived immorality of MEP. Incentives for MEP included preservation of one's estate and protection of a spouse. Finally, variability in accessibility to and awareness of MEP was described. Implications: This exploratory study identifies motivations for individual behaviors and describes evolving social norms regarding MEP; implications for policy and research are discussed.   Long-term care financing ,  Nursing homes ,  Social norms Laurence G. Branch, PhDMedicaid, a federal-state means-tested health insurance program for the poor, is the largest single payor of nursing home services and other long-term care. In 1997, Medicaid financed 47% of the $83 billion in nursing home expenditures (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 1999   ). Medicaid benefits are available only to those who meet specific income and asset standards set by each state and who are determined to be poor in accordance with these criteria. (In Connecticut, e.g., assets cannot exceed $1,600 for individuals and $2,400 for couples to qualify for Medicaid; a house is not counted as an asset in most instances.) Current federal and state laws prohibit the transfer of property or financial assets for the purpose of qualifying for Medicaid, if the transfer was done during the 36 months preceding the application for Medicaid.Medicaid estate planning (MEP) involves legal and financial approaches to satisfying financial eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care. More specifically, an individual's assets are sheltered with the intention of precluding consideration of such assets in determining Medicaid eligibility. Despite the continuing interest in understanding MEP and its impact on Medicaid expenditures, only a few empirical studies have quantified its magnitude and associated implications for the Medicaid program expenditures (General Accounting Office 1989   , General Accounting Office 1993   , General Accounting Office 1997   ; Office of the Inspector General 1989   ). Available evidence indicates that the incidence of MEP is low (Wiener 1996   ; Taylor et al. 1999   ), although some observers disagree (Moses 1990   ). There is wide variation in the level and nature of MEP activities across states because of state-specific legal, socioeconomic, and health service factors (Burwell and Crown 1996   ). On the whole, evidence regarding MEP prevalence is inconclusive and varies in terms of both methodology and findings. The disparate perceptions among elder law attorneys, Medicaid eligibility workers, and certified financial planners as to the magnitude of MEP (Walker, Robison, and Gruman 1998   ) suggest that it is essential to gather primary data from individual applicants and their families.The limited research on MEP has examined outcomes (estimated magnitude and prevalence of transfers) rather than the process itself (timing and motivations behind decisions to transfer assets). No prospective longitudinal studies have assessed the relationship of individual expectations to the transfer of wealth for the purpose of accessing Medicaid. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study are the first two major national studies designed to gather the type of longitudinal data necessary to explore multiple aspects of health and family transitions and their impact on wealth transfer (Dunn and Phillips 1997   ; McGarry and Schoeni 1997   ; Soldo and Hill 1994   ). The AHEAD project will allow for tracking of episodes for Medicaid eligibility and how these episodes relate to health dynamics and intergenerational transfers. Future waves of the study will more closely examine asset transfers and relationships to family structure, perceptions of need and actual behavior. However, data are presently unavailable to address these questions (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, and Wallace 1997   ).A variety of system-level factors may influence an individual's participation in Medicaid planning activities (Burwell 1991   ; Walker and Burwell 1998   ). Federal and state Medicaid eligibility policies have a strong influence on Medicaid planning, including the complexity of financial eligibility rules and requirements for impoverishment. Costs and quality of nursing home care are also important considerations. Estate recovery policies, which allow the government to retroactively recover costs that have been paid by the public on behalf of Medicaid long-term care recipients, are hypothesized to play a critical role in MEP. Evidence suggests there is great variability among states in applicable state law, financial impact, and implementation (Office of the Inspector General 1995   ; Sabatino and Wood 1996   ). Finally, the diligence with which local Medicaid eligibility offices enforce regulations may influence individual behaviors in Medicaid planning (Walker and Burwell 1998   ).Individual- and social-level factors that may motivate Medicaid planning have not been examined empirically. However, relevant considerations such as moral hazard, welfare aversion, and bequest motives in the context of long-term care have been explored, primarily in the economics literature. Moral hazard occurs when the existence of a given entity (such as public payment for health care) creates perverse incentives that lead to unintended or undesirable effects. Because most long-term care is provided by family, lower nursing home costs may encourage families to abandon caregiving at taxpayers' expense. The results of one study suggest there is no moral hazard for nursing home care (Reschovsky 1998   ). Qualifying for Medicaid does not appear to be a major reason for creating trusts; rather, factors significantly related to trust formation include wealth, White race, and higher education (Taylor, Sloan, and Norton 1999   ). Evidence on welfare aversion suggests people go to great lengths to avoid becoming recipients of Medicaid, even receiving transfer payments from children or liquidating housing assets (Crown, Burwell, and Alecxih 1994   ; Norton 1995   ).Protection of a family estate to ensure inheritance for the children has been described as a central value in our society (Hill 1995   ; Kane 1996   ; Langbein 1991   ; Moody 1995   ) and may be a primary motivation for MEP (Walker, Gruman, and Robison 1999   ). Bequest motives to explain intergenerational transfers have been described through altruism (McGarry and Schoeni 1995   ) and exchange models (Cox 1987   ). Empirical evidence as to the relative contribution of each is mixed. Altruism and parental concern for children has been most commonly proposed, although some research on bequest motives and patterns challenges this notion (Laitner and Juster 1996   ; Tachibanaki 1994   ; Wilhelm 1996   ). Exchange theory models maintain that transfers are a form of exchange based on a risk-sharing arrangement in which parents transfer assets and expect support from children if they live longer than expected (Cox 1987   ). Finally, the notion of generativity has been offered as a motivation for bequests (Alexander, Rubenstein, Goodman, and Luborsky 1991   ). No theoretical framework for MEP has been proposed in the literature.This research was a direct outgrowth of previous quantitative and qualitative work examining the prevalence, magnitude, and policy responses to MEP from the perspectives of lawyers, financial planners, and policymakers (Walker and Burwell 1998   ; Walker et al. 1998   , Walker et al. 1999   ). These studies raised new questions about individual-level and system-level motivations for MEP. In the research reported here, we sought to examine MEP from a perspective not yet explored—that of older individuals and their caregivers living in the community, who may be planning for how to finance nursing home care in the future. Methods Study Design This study employed focus group methodology, a qualitative approach particularly well suited for research that is either exploratory (Morgan and Krueger 1998   ) or confirmatory (Miles and Huberman 1994   ) in nature. Investigators commonly use focus groups to discover more about a topic for which understanding is limited (Stewart and Shamdasani 1990   ) and that involves personal and social constructs (Kuzel 1999   ).Eighteen focus groups of 5–12 members each were conducted. Groups were stratified on the basis of race/ethnicity/socioeconomic status (SES), previous use of nursing home and/or home care services, and caregiver status (see  Table 1  ). These strata were developed on the basis of a priori evidence that suggests such factors may play a role in MEP.Strata were defined as follows. Race/ethnicity groups comprised White and African American categories. Experience with formal long-term care included those presently using services available across the continuum (home care, nursing home care, assisted living), those not using such services, or family caregivers. Because of the complexity of the stratification plan, participants were screened in advance and assigned only with regard to experience with long-term care, caregiving experience, and race/ethnicity. So as not to discourage participation, the SES data were gathered at the focus group site. A composite of income, assets, and education was developed for each group. Categorization on the basis of SES was determined by three commonly accepted indicators—education, income, and assets. The criteria used to define SES level, based on mean measures for each group, are indicated in  Table 2  . These measures consistently resulted in the same SES classification (i.e., a given group was rated low, moderate, or high on each of the three measures—education, income and assets).The relative merits of homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups have been debated (Brown 1999   ). For this study, it was important to have group members share an experience to facilitate exchange of views, strengthen the group interviewing process, and achieve compatibility among group members (Morse 1995   ). Hence, we used the homogeneous method to enhance discussions about responsibility for financing long-term care generally and MEP specifically. Each group was uniform with regard to race/ethnicity and experience with long-term care (i.e., all White or all African American; all using, not using, or caregivers). SES levels were somewhat mixed in three groups, again because such data were not included in the screening process in advance of the session.The sessions were approximately 1.5 h in length and were conducted in locations both familiar and accessible to participants. A monetary incentive of $25 per person was provided. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hartford Hospital. Instrumentation A series of 11 guiding questions with structured probes was developed by a multidisciplinary team, including a sociologist, an anthropologist, an epidemiologist, two state policymakers, and two gerontologists. The guide was also reviewed by a panel of long-term care consumers and advocates for comprehensibility and scope (the Connecticut Lifelong Care Community Advisory Board). The team designed the questions to stimulate discussion on (a) individual plans to pay for nursing home care, (b) attitudes toward government and familial responsibilities in paying for nursing home care, (c) views on MEP, and (d) attitudes toward rights to material legacy and inheritance. This report of findings focuses on the discussions most germane to MEP. Additionally, to characterize the groups, we asked participants to complete a seven-item structured questionnaire gathering sociodemographic information. Questions included age, gender, marital status, education, living arrangements, monthly household income, and total assets. No personal identifiers were used, because data were to be reported in the aggregate (by focus group), and anonymity was promised. Data Analysis We made an audiotape for each session to allow for clarification of points and preparation of transcripts for analysis. Recorded data were formatted as a single transcript per session and imported into QSR NUD*IST 4.0 software for sorting, coding, and analysis. The code structure was reviewed twice by the research team and an external expert (Research Talk) for verification. Refinements were made at each review and during the analysis process on the basis of interpretative observations (Crabtree and Miller 1999   ). As transcripts were coded, recurrent themes were noted and text was clustered under these themes in accordance with the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss 1967   ) until no new themes emerged.Systematic, verifiable analysis of the focus groups was accomplished through a number of strategies, including consistent use of the discussion guide, audiotaping and independent professional preparation of the transcripts, standardized coding and analysis of the data, and creation of an analysis audit trail to document analytic decisions (Kirk and Miller 1986   ; Miles and Huberman 1994   ). Findings Sociodemographic characteristics of focus group participants are presented in  Table 3  (missing data excluded, valid percentages reported). The majority of participants were aged 75 or older (n = 83), although one fifth (n = 27) were aged less than 65, representing the family caregivers. Three quarters were female (n = 123), and 40% (n = 61) were married. The majority of participants (53%) lived alone (n = 81). Distribution over the education categories was fairly equal, with roughly one quarter in each category. As a result of the sampling strategy, 20% of participants were African American (n = 28). The monthly household income measure reflected diverse financial resources among participants, with roughly 20% in each income group. Finally, assets were strongly skewed at the anchoring ends, with one third of participants reporting fewer than $25,000 in assets (n = 55) and 23% reporting more than $350,000 in assets (n = 36). Despite attempts to enroll African American participants of high SES, there were only 4 in the high-SES level. The African American groups, in the aggregate, were classified as being in the moderate SES range.Focus group participants were asked to share their views on MEP, guided by this series of broad questions: "Some people talk about protecting their assets like their bank accounts or other properties so they don't get spent on the nursing home. This is called Medicaid estate planning. Have you heard people talk about this? What do you think about this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this?" Several themes emerged from discussions: disincentives of MEP (losing control of one's assets, stigma of Medicaid benefits, and perceived immorality of MEP), incentives of MEP (preservation of estate and protection of one's spouse), and variation in accessibility to and awareness of MEP ( Table 4  ). Disincentives to MEP Three emergent themes representing disincentives to engage in MEP were strongly expressed across all groups, regardless of race, SES, or experience with long-term care. First, participants agreed that the prospect of losing control of one's assets was very troublesome and unpalatable, even if such assets were turned over to children whom the parent trusted. Second, discussions about the stigma associated with receipt of Medicaid benefits were compelling and received substantial attention among some groups. Finally, the subjective norm data revealed a general consensus that MEP, although legal, is also immoral and inappropriate. This was a recurrent and forcefully articulated theme that occurred across groups that differed by race and SES. Each of these potential disincentives is presented later with illustrative quotes for each. Losing Control of Assets One of the issues consistently identified was the fear of losing control of one's assets. This concern was expressed among groups across each of the SES levels, as well as experience with long-term care groups. In some cases, the concern was general in nature, whereas in others it was clearly related to the potential that the child in control of the assets might exercise poor judgment.Well, it's kind of a scary thing to take a large portion of whatever funds you have available and give them to somebody else, even if it's one of your children whom you trust. It's still kind of scary. It's hard to do. You work all your life to establish some kind of financial security and suddenly it's out the window.If you leave this money over to your children, sometimes children can be very selfish. They take the money and spend it and now not only does your child not have the money but now you're penniless.Medicaid Stigma.—Discussions surrounding the Medicaid program evoked passionate responses from participants in many of the groups about the stigma associated with receiving benefits. These comments were not probed for by moderators, but rather emerged as a significant subtext to the conversations. In groups where the dynamic was positive and members felt most comfortable, those receiving welfare benefits were candid about effects on their self-esteem. Two of the high-SES groups were characterized by a strong social conscience among members, who also made observations about the impact of Medicaid stigma.There were a number of very candid exchanges among participants presently enrolled in a Medicaid-sponsored home care program and in the low-SES groups. Typically, the issue of stigma was raised during discussions about Medicaid and individual responsibility for paying for care. Some group members responded to such conversations by explaining their use of welfare benefits. While the more vocal participants expressed the negative effects of welfare on their self-esteem and sense of pride, others quietly nodded in agreement.To begin with, when you ask for help from the government you absolutely need it because nobody likes to be thrown a bone, nobody.It kind of belittles you. [And] It's the last resort. [In reply] It's your pride, naturally.You feel degraded, I guess that's what it is.It gives you kind of a funny feeling. [In reply] I think the same thing. I mean, nobody wants to get stuff for free.In several of the high-SES groups, more philosophical observations were offered. Although less poignant, the comments are still reflective of social norms around impoverishment and stigma of accessing services through a welfare-based program.To be forced to reduce your financial holdings in order to get Medicaid is destructive to the spirit of the individual who has to get rid of the money.That notion, that you are totally at the mercy of the government subsidy of Medicaid, is more negative than those who built the law thought about.I think anytime you are dependent on anything, dependency breeds rage. You don't get Medicaid unless your resources are down below $2,000 or something like that. That's probably a need that the country has but it is not a healthy state somehow. [In reply] It's terrible.Nearly all of the focus groups addressed the issue of whether Medicaid status influenced the quality of care provided to a beneficiary. There was strong consensus that individuals covered by Medicaid received a poorer quality of nursing home care, particularly if the caregiver was aware of the person's payment source. A number of groups raised the issue that an individual receiving Medicaid may not feel entitled to or comfortable with asking for certain services.When you think about the fact that perhaps the Medicaid care might not be as good as if you paid for it yourself, so in that instance [who participated in MEP], somebody's getting their just desserts. I just have a feeling that if you paid for something you might get a little better care than if you were strictly state supported.If you have a low income you can't demand anything.We get what we pay for. Suppose we have 25 and another person will pay 100, they get better care. This is what I am trying to say.Well, I also think that if someone else is paying you don't have the right to ask for certain things. You feel that it's not coming to you. [In reply] Whereas if you are paying for it you feel it's your right to have it because you paid for it.Extensive discussion occurred in three of the moderate-SES groups about disclosure of Medicaid status to health care providers, with several participants arguing that no one other than the nursing home's accounting office should be aware of an individual's method of paying for care. Comments illustrated concern for privacy, as well as concerns about lesser quality of care for Medicaid recipients.Whether you pay for it by yourself or you are on Medicaid, you should still get the same care.I don't think it should make any difference how you are treated. The dollar is being paid. The person doing the work don't [sic] know where the dollar is coming from.I would imagine that if a nurse's aide is coming to help you and they know you are on Title 19 they would probably push you aside a little bit. If you have a lot of money you [sic] are going to be good to them. Morality of MEP. Views regarding the morality of MEP dominated discussions, most often in the moderate- and high-SES groups. The majority of comments indicated that participants believed MEP, as they understood it, is inappropriate and immoral. This opposition generally reflected notions of fairness and equity as well as individual responsibility in paying for nursing home care.I think it's immoral to try and get rid of all your money out there before you go to a nursing home. Somehow, that isn't right.I think that, personally, [MEP] lacks integrity. To impoverish yourself so you will be on the backs of the taxpayers, to me, is wrong.Here you are a millionaire but yet taxpayers have to pay for you to be in a nursing home. Who do you feel sorry for, the person who has $20,000 and you took it or the person who has $20 million and doesn't pay anything?However, there were several exchanges in which focus group members argued that MEP is acceptable in some circumstances. A few group members contended that the present long-term care financing system encourages (and even necessitates) such behavior. Those comments typically emerged from groups who were of moderate SES and/or were caregivers experiencing the burden of paying for an extended nursing home stay for a spouse or parent.If the law requires impoverishment, then to divest oneself of assets in order to achieve what is required is made wrong by the passage of a law. Whether it is wrong in a philosophical sense is another question altogether. There are as many opinions as there are people.Then if you have nothing then you go on Title 19, the best thing in the world that can happen to you.It seems unethical if it is a wealthy person somehow. I make an exception, if it is middle class or less, I consider it ethical somehow. I am not sure why I make that distinction. Incentives for MEP Two themes emerged from the focus group data that represent incentives to participate in MEP. First, there was high concordance across all groups as to the importance of avoiding total impoverishment associated with prolonged nursing home stays. Personal tales of a catastrophic long-term care event that wiped out life savings clearly resonated with focus group members. Second, the significance of protecting spouses living in the community was underscored in many group discussions. Current community spouse protection regulations under Medicaid were either misunderstood or viewed as inadequate by participants. Those focus group members (primarily in caregiver groups) who expressed concerns about their future well-being did so in the context of arguing that MEP is a reasonable course for a community spouse to take. Protection Against Total Impoverishment The importance of protecting against total impoverishment was raised in discussions, primarily in the moderate- and high-SES groups. As participants talked about the Medicaid program and its financial eligibility standards, there was general agreement that such standards are severe. In many of the groups, members shared personal accounts about someone who had been made destitute in paying for nursing home care before qualifying for Medicaid. Response to these reports was uniformly negative, generating statements about the need to provide a "decent" lifestyle for those supported by a government program.I think our government has a responsibility to us that they don't get us down to zero dollars, that they leave us with enough money to function in a normal existence. We should have some sort of an index that says at so many dollars we are not going to extract any more from you and let the person live a normal life.If it [Medicaid] requires divesting oneself of his entire estate, that is a little extreme the way it is now but it seems to me that the program could be worked out that would [complement] individuals to avoid complete discharge of their estate.The importance in American society of bequests and other forms of legacy was echoed in each of the focus groups. The general notion of leaving an estate for the next generation was espoused by some participants. Although they were not specifically asked about the home, some groups spoke specifically of the significance of passing on the family homestead.First and foremost, you don't want to give up your home. [In reply] That's a big thing—giving up your home.I think the home should be kept sacred.There was one group member, with whom several others agreed, who felt differently about the preservation of the family home, suggesting that expectations must change in the current social and economic environment:That sentimental attachment to your home and things that are customary is one of the chronic afflictions of older age and has to be overcome. Spousal Protection. The caregiver groups offered a unique and important perspective on the role of MEP in providing protection to the spouse living in the community. Several persons candidly shared their experience in financing a nursing home stay for their spouse and described their fears about the implications for their own future. Comments reflected a limited understanding of current Medicaid policy related to spouses.I don't think they are hiding it. I think what they are doing in many cases is trying to protect themselves like we were talking about the husband or wife gets sick and the other one is saying okay I'll pay the bills. But you wonder. I am paying the bill down at the home and I wonder what is going to happen when my time comes because I am going down fast. That is what you worry about.I don't think you should be allowed to divest totally. My concern is when there is a surviving spouse benefit. If the wealth was considered your home I don't think the surviving spouse that can remain in the home should divest of that estate.I am concerned about myself right now because if my wife lives, she could live another 20 years or so and uses up all of these funds, and they come and grab the rest that I have for myself, I got nothing. Variation in Access to and Awareness of MEP There was commentary in most moderate- and high-SES groups that MEP was feasible or appropriate only for select individuals, particularly those with a substantial amount of assets. Several participants argued, however, that persons with very high assets should not be concerned with protecting such assets through MEP, because they can pay privately for services in settings other than a nursing home (such as a continuing care retirement community).The problem is if you need the assets in order to live then you can't part with them and still afford to live your life. You need the income from the assets. So it's a Catch-22.If you have a million dollars you should be living good and taking care of your own house and don't be worried about spending down. Why would I want to leave my kids something so I could live in a decrepit place, a convalescent home on Title 19?It was also observed that those participating in MEP had access to essential informational resources, such as elder law attorneys or financial resources. These comments emerged primarily from the moderate- and low-SES groups.I had a friend whose wife was in there and they were paying and then he went to the attorney and he said now buy a new car, fix the roof on your house, and he did everything for his benefit to get his money down and then go on Medicaid. So there are ways and means, unfortunately for some people and others don't have that.I know people who have done it. One lady's son was a judge… Everything went to her son and then she became ill and this [sic] the taxpayers picked up the tab and this happens to people who have the knowledge that they can do it.Sure I've heard of it [MEP]. It's what rich people do. Discussion This study offers evidence regarding individual motivations for MEP that have not been previously reported in the literature. Empirical research to date has focused on measuring the magnitude and prevalence of asset transfers through data provided by state Medicaid programs (Burwell and Crown 1995   ; General Accounting Office 1993   ). Although primary data about MEP are challenging to gather, the perspectives of individuals and families involved in Medicaid planning are essential to fully characterize system-level, social, and individual factors relevant to MEP (Walker and Burwell 1998   ). In this study, individuals presently using long-term care services, individuals anticipating using services, and family caregivers identified potential disincentives and incentives for MEP. Findings have relevance for both policy and research regarding MEP. Implications for Policy Focus group members offered impassioned statements that the present model—using a means-tested program to ensure access to nursing home care—is not humane public policy and is contradictory to social norms of caring for vulnerable citizens. Participants also reported that impoverishment requirements may increase interest in MEP. One policy option identified by some groups is to increase the amount of assets that individuals can retain and still qualify for Medicaid benefits. Simulations of the cost of raising the asset test for Medicaid nursing home benefits estimated that the fiscal impact of raising the limit (to $12,000, $20,000, or $30,000) would be relatively minor (Crown et al. 1994   ). Others produced similar estimates of moderate impact on Medicaid expenditures, projecting the number of days covered by Medicaid would increase only slightly if the asset limits were raised (Norton 1995   ). A change in policy to increase retainable asset amounts might reduce fear of total impoverishment due to the need for nursing home care as well as minimize economic incentives to participate in MEP.A second finding indicated that ensuring the well-being of a spouse of an institutionalized individual is a major concern, particularly among the caregiving groups. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 contained provisions regarding asset transfers and included protections for the community-dwelling spouse. Although there has been general consensus on spousal protections in theory, there is less agreement on the scope and intent of such protections (Moody 1995   ). Some suggest that Medicaid has been expanded from a welfare program to address the needs of the middle class as well (Dobris 1989   ; Kapp 1997   ; Taylor et al. 1999   ). Others observe that federal and state policy relies on Medicaid as a safety net for nursing home care, yet regulations also endorse a parallel system that may facilitate broader access to Medicaid benefits for long-term care coverage (Wiener, Illston, and Hanley 1994   ). This conflicting policy is echoed in the public perceptions of morality and necessity of MEP as reported by older adults and their families in this study.The subjective norms and individual attitudes raise questions about the effectiveness of regulations in shaping individual behavior and defining social expectations around financing nursing home care. Researchers in one study attempted to quantify the administrative costs of enforcing the complex MEP regulations, and found them to be substantial (Harris and Horvath 1992   ). Concern about compliance with regulations was raised in just one group (moderate SES, White, non–service users). Many of the members reported having met with an estate planning attorney and seemed to feel quite confident in his or her ability to comply with regulations and assist them in planning to finance future nursing home care. At least for those in this study, regulation did not appear not to play a major role in influencing individual MEP behavior. A thorough examination of the costs of developing, implementing, and enforcing MEP regulations is critical in estimating the overall impact of MEP on State Medicaid budgets (Walker et al. 1998   ). Implications for Research Efforts to estimate the magnitude of MEP have been impeded by the sensitivity of the issue and methodological challenges in gathering primary data from individuals. Although study participants were not explicitly asked whether they had transferred assets, many shared freely about their plans and actions in this regard. They also spoke with candor about their fears of needing nursing home care in the future, the strain of certain family dynamics and expectations of others, and feelings of shame associated with receiving welfare benefits. This study demonstrates the efficacy of focus group methodology, especially in the early phases of a research effort, to identify key facets of a phenomenon through an inductive approach.Research aimed at understanding individual motivations for MEP requires preliminary data about potential influencing factors. Accordingly, in this study we set out to advance the research agenda by exploring the entire scope of considerations relevant to people's thinking about MEP. Certain of these factors, such as bequest motivations, avoidance of impoverishment, and perceived risk of needing nursing home care, have been previously hypothesized to play a role in MEP behaviors, although they have not been examined in any depth. Further attention should be directed toward understanding the role of potential influences (including norms of wealth transfer and responsibility for providing nursing home care) on individual decisions regarding long-term care financing generally and MEP specifically. A second important area of inquiry is the contrasting perceptions of morality and necessity of MEP among those who have participated in MEP and those who have not. Although it is likely to be extremely challenging for researchers to recruit individuals who will report having transferred assets to qualify for Medicaid, working with elder law attorneys or certified financial planners to identify clients and using a methodology that effectively assures confidentiality may be useful.Findings should be considered in light of three general limitations of the study. Using focus groups to explore a potentially sensitive topic may have led to purposeful nonresponse or to misrepresentation of participant actions or views. The group dynamic was seen as critical to examining social norms, yet it posed challenges in terms of ensuring that participants' views were articulated honestly and completely. Moderators were trained to observe group interactions and wherever possible to minimize dynamics that may have constrained participation. In addition to moderator intervention, transcripts were analyzed to identify recurrent bias or dominance of a particular participant. The transcript reviews indicated that although the degree of participation certainly varied among members, more dominant individuals did not appear to significantly influence the nature of information shared by others.Second, the composition of the groups may have been biased by the omission of important informants. Although "saturation" was achieved and it is quite likely that all major themes were elicited from focus group participants, there are several notable sources of potential bias in the sample. Groups recruited through institutions were drawn from two assisted living environments and two adult day care centers. In addition, all individuals were willing and able to participate in a focus group. It is possible that those who had experience with MEP were hesitant about discussing those activities and declined participation.A final limitation of the study is the fact that it was conducted in a single state. Although the particular state is one believed to be among the most active in MEP, the generalizability of this study is constrained by the fact that it was conducted in only one state. The very nature of MEP dictates that the research must take into account state-specific regulatory, socioeconomic, and service delivery factors (Burwell and Crown 1995   ). For example, individuals living in states with aggressive enforcement of MEP regulations might be more likely to identify regulations as an influencing factor on MEP behavior.Despite these limitations, the study makes several contributions to the evolving research agenda on MEP. Previous research has examined perspectives of elder law attorneys, certified financial planners, Medicaid policymakers, and eligibility workers regarding the magnitude and prevalence of MEP (Walker et al. 1998   , Walker et al. 1999   ). In this study we addressed a void in the existing empirical literature regarding MEP. The large-scale, longitudinal AHEAD study presently underway will measure the nature and structure of wealth transfer, but no research has examined individual motivations for MEP. In this qualitative, exploratory study, we identify the primary individual- and social-level factors related to asset transfer for Medicaid qualification. Focus group methodology, well suited for exploratory research, generated discussion about participants' experiences with and beliefs about long-term care financing generally and MEP specifically. The transcriptions of discussions reveal how individuals conceive of, and talk about, MEP. Although large-scale surveys will be necessary for researchers to examine potential associations more rigorously, the study of social norms through such an approach is challenging. Exploratory approaches to identify normative considerations from the perspective of individuals who may pursue MEP can inform the development of a theoretical framework, hypotheses, and instrumentation for future studies.

     Abstract Purpose: Support of older adults' capacity to age in place is a core concept of the assisted living philosophy. This research examined implementation of the aging-in-place philosophy in 1 midwestern state (Kansas). Design and Methods: This study was part of a larger state agency and university collaborative project to examine admission and discharge policies in these settings. Data analysis was conducted with descriptive statistics. Kansas findings were compared to national findings. Results: Residents' capacity to age in place was limited by facility admission and discharge policies that were more restrictive than state regulations in the areas of behavioral problems, incontinence, and cognition. In general, assisted living facility policies in Kansas were more restrictive than admission and discharge policies found nationally. Implications: More inclusive assisted living admission and discharge criteria, and concomitant staffing and funding, are necessary if the aging-in-place philosophy is to be more fully implemented.   Assisted living ,  Aging in place ,  Long-term care ,  Admission and discharge criteria ,  Resident discharge Laurence G. Branch, PhDAssisted living is becoming an increasingly important component of the long-term care system, both for the traditional private-pay consumer and for federal and state government agencies seeking more economical and noninstitutional ways to care for low-income, frail older people. Assisted living has been referred to as "housing for the elderly with supportive services in a homelike environment" (Lewin-VHI 1996   , p. 1–2). Most definitions emphasize a residential setting with services on a 24-hr (or unscheduled) basis and a high degree of consumer choice and control (Kane and Wilson 1993   ; Zimmerman and Sloane 1999   ). Some researchers have suggested that it is this availability of unscheduled services that distinguishes assisted living from services delivered in individual homes (Mollica 1998   ). Definitions of assisted living vary on major issues such as type of setting (apartment or room), range of services (e.g., activity of daily living [ADL] assistance to skilled nursing), level of privacy (shared or private), and degree of autonomy (e.g., locked door, right to refuse services; Wilson 1996   ).Assisted living has evolved largely in response to market demand and has been shaped by a variety of local conditions and special interests. A projected 14 million elderly Americans needing long-term care over the next 20 years will fuel continued demand for assisted living (U.S. General Accounting Office 1999   ). Citro and Hermanson 1999    projected that assisted living will be the fastest growing type of senior housing in the United States, with an estimated 15–20% annual growth rate over the last few years.Central to the philosophy of assisted living is greater resident control of his or her environment, including what services are received, when, and how. This philosophy is in contrast to the more medically oriented model, where the resident is a patient, being cared for according to an institutional schedule. Assisted living is "a more consumer focused model that organizes the setting and the delivery of service around the resident rather than the facility" (Mollica 1998   , p. 1).Aging in place has been an integral component of the philosophy and promise of the assisted living industry nationally (Assisted Living Federation of America [ALFA], 1998). The key to an aging-in-place philosophy is for a facility to adjust its service provision and level of care criteria to meet residents' changing needs and to avoid having to discharge individuals to a higher level of care prematurely. The facility that adopts an aging-in-place philosophy will allow for the provision of routine nursing care and medication assistance. This aging-in-place philosophy means residents will have to relocate to a new setting less often. One practice that facilitates a resident's aging in place is "managed" or "negotiated" risk. This practice allows facilities to negotiate a written agreement with a resident who prefers to receive services in a nonstandard way, so long as it does not place others' health and safety at risk.Aging in place benefits states as well. Several studies have concluded that care in assisted living facilities, when targeted to appropriate clients, can be substantially less costly compared with that in nursing facilities (Kane and Wilson 1993   ; Leon and Moyer 1999   ; Lewin-VHI 1996   ; Manard 1992   ; U.S. General Accounting Office 1997   ). Although, on average, nursing facility residents are much more impaired than assisted living residents, earlier research in Kansas found approximately the same percentage of older adults with two to three ADL impairments in assisted living facilities and nursing facilities (Chapin, Dobbs, Moore, and Waltner 1999   ). The longer this particular subset of older adults can age in place and remain in assisted living facilities, the greater the cost savings will be to states (Mollica and Snow 1996   ).Our purpose in this article is to delineate the parameters within which one state's (Kansas) assisted living facilities have allowed residents to age in place. In this state, university researchers and state policymakers collaborate on an ongoing basis to examine program and policy outcomes for older adults. As is the case in most states, state regulatory structures allow for extensive service provision and a relatively high level of care needs in assisted living settings. Owners and operators still can restrict their retention policies to care for less impaired residents than the rules make possible. In this paper, we compare Kansas facility admission and retention policies with national facility admission and retention policies. Implications for increasing seniors' ability to age in place in assisted living settings are discussed.Attention to aging in place is particularly important now, because the demand for assisted living is escalating and the supply of assisted living facilities is increasing. Mitchell and Kemp 2000    found a 37% increase in assisted living facilities (also referred to as residential care homes) from 1990 to 1998, with services in assisted living facilities in 1998 provided to approximately 500,000 older adults. The American Seniors Housing Association (ASHA) identified 55,273 senior housing units in its 1998 study, which included 6,085 assisted living units in freestanding facilities, 21,273 congregate housing units, and 27,915 continuing care retirement community housing units (ASHA 1999   ). Recent studies have reported assisted living national occupancy rates varying from 84% to 93.7% of full capacity (ASHA 1999   ; Hawes, Rose, and Phillips 1999   ).Although people are entering assisted living in unprecedented numbers, it appears they are only staying for an average of 30.8 months (2.6 years), according to a recent national study conducted by the National Investment Conference (NIC; 1998). A more recent national study found an even lower average length of stay of 18 months (ASHA 1999   ). These findings take on added significance in light of the person-environment fit theory, which suggests that an element of successful aging is a person's ability to age in place in a stable living environment (Hooyman and Kiyak 1999   ; Kahana 1975   ). When older adults have control over the decision to move and choose assisted living, it is typically with the intention of being able to age in place and not having to relocate (U.S. General Accounting Office 1999   ). Once an older adult is too frail physically and cognitively to make the decision to move, control over the decision of where to move is often assumed by family (Dobbs 1998   ). The loss of control over the decision to move can affect older adults' satisfaction with services as well as their emotional well-being (Reinardy 1992   , Reinardy 1995   ).Relocation can cause stress, isolation, grieving, and an overall decline in physical and psychological functioning in older adults (Staveley 1997   ). Studies have indicated that relocation, particularly to a nursing facility, places frail older adults at risk for developing depression and suicide ideation (Haight, Michel, and Hendrix 1998   ). Physical problems such as weight loss have been found in older adults after relocation to an institutional facility (Lander, Brazill, and Ladrigan 1997   ). In addition, relocation is financially burdensome to older adults, especially for those with lower incomes (Thomasma, Yeaworth, and McCabe 1990   ). Furthermore, the social consequences of moving from place to place have also been documented (Bartlett 1993   ). Some of those consequences include the loss of social relationships with staff and residents, the need to form new social relationships, changes in an established daily routine, and loss of continuity of care. If older adults have to move from an assisted living facility to a nursing facility, they are usually faced with having to limit their personal possessions because of reduced personal space in the nursing facility (Regnier, Hamilton, and Yatabe 1995   ). This can be emotionally problematic for older adults because the stripping of personal possessions strips older persons of their self-identity (Goffman 1961   ). Given these findings, it is important for owners and operators of assisted living facilities to develop policies that allow residents in assisted living facilities to age in place as long as their needs can be safely met in that environment.Proponents of assisted living have argued that assisted living can meet the needs of less impaired residents currently being served in nursing facilities (Wilson 1996   ). If less impaired older adults who are receiving state subsidies can be served in assisted living, then states can potentially reduce reliance on expensive institutional care, while allowing older adults to age in place in an environment that is more homelike, private, and respectful of individual differences (Wilson 1996   ). The extent to which a person can age in place in assisted living settings before having to go to a higher level of care is determined, in part, by a state's admission and retention policies. Mollica 1998    cited Kansas as one of nine states with the broadest parameters for admission and retention policies. Kansas adult care home statutes permit the provision of skilled nursing services in assisted living settings (Kansas Adult Care Home Regulations, 1997). The statute stipulates that services shall be "provided on an intermittent or limited-term basis or, if limited in scope, on a regular basis." However, Kansas permits individuals to remain in the facility so long as provisions can be made to meet their needs. Examination of state regulations suggests that the Kansas policy of allowing more health care services to be delivered in assisted living settings facilitates aging in place.Much research has been published that profiles assisted living both nationally and at the state level. However, little empirical work has been published about outcomes in assisted living settings. This research, designed to examine admission and retention policies, provided the university research team an opportunity to look at whether admission and retention policies in Kansas's assisted living facilities support or inhibit aging-in-place. In addition, we examined the reasons for resident discharge as well as the discharge destination. Methods Study Setting We asked all licensed assisted living and residential health care facilities in Kansas to complete a facility survey. The Kansas Adult Care Home Regulations (1997) define assisted living facilities asany place or facility caring for six or more individuals not related within the third degree of relationship to the administrator, operator or owner by blood or marriage and who, by choice or due to functional impairments, may need personal care and may need supervised nursing care to compensate for activities of daily living limitations … and in which the place or facility includes apartments for residents and provides or coordinates a range of services including personal care or supervised nursing care available 24 hours, seven days a week for the support of resident independence [skilled nursing services are not prohibited]. Generally, the skilled services provided in an assisted living facility shall be provided on an intermittent or limited term basis, or if limited in scope, a regular basis.At a minimum, both assisted living and residential health care facilities have to include a toilet; bathing facilities; sleeping, living, and storage areas; and a lockable door. In addition, assisted living facilities are required to have kitchens for residents. For the purpose of this study, results for both assisted living and residential health care facilities were combined and reported as assisted living facilities following the model of the NIC (1998) study. Using similar definitions allows for valid comparisons between Kansas's facilities and the NIC study findings. Facility Sample There were 141 facilities in Kansas represented in this study. At the time of the study, the total occupancy capacity for these facilities was 5,110 and the current resident census was 3,579. The median occupancy rate was 75%. The capacity size ranged from 6 units to 227 units, with a median size of 56 units. Approximately 14% of facilities included in this research were located in rural towns (populations of less than 10,000); 54% were located in midsized cities (10,000 or greater but not designated as metropolitan); and 32% were located in metropolitan statistical areas as listed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1998). Data Collection The university research team, in collaboration with the Kansas Department on Aging, collected data to examine facility admission and retention policies. At the time of data collection (February 1999), there were 169 facilities in Kansas. We received an 83% response rate (N = 141). We gathered information about the following facility characteristics: admission and retention policies, reasons for resident discharge, discharge destinations, and average length of resident stay. Facilities had a choice of completing a survey by mail or telephone. Measurement Facility administrators were asked if they would admit or retain residents with various conditions. We selected conditions for our admission and retention criteria section that have been documented in the literature on the health status of assisted living residents (Kane and Wilson 1993   ; Mollica 1998   ; NIC 1998   ) and resident conditions that were allowed in Kansas's licensed assisted living and residential health care facilities (Kansas Adult Care Home Regulations, 1997).To determine the most common reasons for resident discharge, we gave facility administrators a list of five common reasons for resident discharge and an "other" category. We asked facility administrators to rank their top three reasons for resident discharge. The reasons for resident discharge used in the survey instrument included (a) care needs became too great, (b) behavior problems, (c) functioning improved, (d) not enough funds, (e) spouse died or moved, and (f) other (please explain). Responses were assigned scores ranging from 0 to 3. The reason ranked first was assigned a score of 3, the reason ranked second was assigned a score of 2, the reason ranked third was assigned a score of 1, and those reasons not ranked were assigned a score of 0. An average score was computed for each reason.To determine the most common discharge destinations, we asked facility administrators to rank the top three discharge destinations. The same scoring method that was used for the reasons for resident discharge was used for scoring the discharge destinations. The discharge destinations included in the survey instrument included (a) death in the setting, did not move out; (b) nursing facility, (c) hospital, (d) another assisted living facility, and (e) other (please explain). In addition, we asked facility administrators to estimate the average resident's length of stay. Results Admission and Retention Policies Administrators' responses to the facility survey admission and retention policies are reported in  Table 1  . The majority of facility administrators reported that residents who were wheelchair bound, were not bladder continent, were mildly confused, used oxygen, or used a catheter or ostomy were admitted and/or retained in assisted living settings. On the other hand, a majority of facility administrators reported that residents who required a two-person transfer, were not bowel continent, were significantly cognitively impaired, or were not able to pay were not generally admitted or retained in assisted living settings.  Table 1  indicates that admission policies were typically more stringent than retention policies. For certain conditions, once a facility had admitted residents, it was more likely to retain them if the condition then occurred or worsened. However, some facilities would admit a person but not retain them if they were wheelchair bound, were not bowel continent, were unable to perform ADLs without assistance or supervision, or used oxygen. These facilities admitted persons with such conditions, but only if the conditions were temporary.Kansas's facility admission and retention policy findings were compared with the results of the NIC (1998) study of assisted living admission and retention policies. Researchers from the NIC sampled 178 nationally representative assisted living facilities located in 48 states on a subset of the admission and retention policies investigated in Kansas (NIC 1998   ). Those comparisons are displayed in  Table 2  . The comparisons in  Table 2  indicate that Kansas facilities' admission and retention policies were generally more stringent than facilities nationally on those policies examined in both studies. However, there were some exceptions. There was a higher percentage of Kansas facilities that would admit someone who used a catheter or ostomy, used oxygen, or was mildly confused. The percentages of Kansas's facilities that would admit someone who was incontinent of bladder or bowel were markedly lower than the national figures reported from NIC (1998). In the NIC study, incontinence was divided into two categories: someone who was incontinent of bladder or bowel but self-managed, and someone who was incontinent but required assistance. Aging in Place Opportunities for Medicaid HCBS/FE Recipients We also performed analyses to determine the extent to which assisted living facilities were providing the opportunity to age in place for Medicaid Home and Community Based Services/Frail Elderly (HCBS/FE) recipients. We found that 65% of assisted living facilities in Kansas were participating in the Medicaid HCBS/FE program. This percentage is high compared with that of some other states. For example, a study of assisted living conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office 1999    in four geographically representative states (Florida, California, Ohio, and Oregon) found that only 42% of facilities in Florida, 27% of facilities in Ohio, and 28% of facilities in California received some public subsidy to pay for care for some of their residents. In contrast, 86% of Oregon facilities accepted persons receiving Medicaid-waivered services. A National Center for Assisted Living 1998    study reported that 35% of assisted living facilities nationally accepted state reimbursement for low-income residents who qualified.Kansas's payment structure for assisted living has provided an incentive for facilities to participate in the Medicaid HCBS/FE program, thus providing increased access to low-income older adults and the potential to age in place. Kansas uses Medicaid HCBS/FE funds to pay for services provided in assisted living facilities, and Medicaid HCBS/FE recipients use whatever source of income they have to pay for room and board charges in assisted living facilities. The Kansas policy is considered to be more flexible than that of other states, where the amount that can be charged for room and board to Medicaid recipients is limited to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment. This limitation may create disincentives for facilities with higher room and board costs to participate in the Medicaid HCBS/FE program. The higher room and board costs could be paid by Medicaid residents who have incomes that are higher than the SSI cash benefit amount and qualify for Medicaid in some states under a guideline referred to as 300% medically eligible (which is 300% above the SSI allotted cash benefit). Resident Discharge We asked administrators to rank the top three reasons for resident discharge. Of the 141 assisted living administrators who responded to our survey, 137 responded to this question. Reasons for resident discharge are reported in  Table 3  . The primary reason reported by administrators was that residents' health care needs became too great. This finding indicates that when residents needed a higher level of care, assisted living settings were not always able to meet these changing needs. The reason ranked second for resident discharge was resident behavior problems. In follow-up telephone interviews with administrators, the most common behavior problems reported were elopement risk and wandering.We also asked administrators to indicate the most common discharge destinations. Of the 141 assisted living administrators who responded to our survey, 137 responded to this question. The top three discharge destinations are reported in  Table 4  . The top discharge destination was nursing facility, with a mean score of 2.13. Hospital was second with a mean score of 1.29. The third most common ranking was death in the setting. Estimated Average Length of Stay We asked assisted living administrators to estimate the average length of stay for residents in their facility. Of the 141 assisted living administrators who responded to our survey, 107 answered this question. The estimated average length of stay for assisted living residents reported by administrators ranged from 6 months to 7 years, with an average length of stay of 2.36 years. In comparison, NIC reported a resident length of stay of 2.6 years (NIC 1998   ). However, ASHA reported a lower average resident length of stay of 1.5 years (ASHA 1999   ). Discussion We analyzed data in this study to determine the parameters within which assisted living facilities in one midwestern state were allowing residents to age in place. State regulations set the parameters, but "facility specific policies may be developed which limit the potential impact of assisted living to serve residents with higher levels of need" (Mollica and Snow 1996   , p. 46). Our data indicate that Kansas assisted living facilities fill a niche in the long-term care continuum for older adults from relative independence to limited nursing care.On the one hand, Kansas's assisted living facilities have some admission and retention policies that support aging in place. Residents who were able to age in place longer because of more flexible admission criteria included residents who were not ambulatory; who had self-managed incontinence; who had mild forms of dementia; and who had special nursing care needs, such as assistance with oxygen, catheterization, ostomies, medication monitoring, or medication administration. These policy findings indicate that some needs that are typically being met in nursing facilities could also be met in assisted living facilities for a period of time. The fact that facilities strive to retain residents whose needs become greater in some cases (as indicated by the percentage increases from "will admit" to "will retain") is another indication that facilities are serving residents with higher need levels. To provide adequate care for residents with increased care needs, concomitant increases in staffing and resources are necessary.On the other hand, facilities are limiting admission and retention through facility policies. Residents who find their options limited by admission and retention policies include residents who have severe cognitive impairments, residents who cannot cooperate with staff in managing their own incontinence, and residents who are an elopement risk. When facilities do admit residents with significant health care needs, it is usually contingent on the resident being able to self-manage the problem (e.g., incontinence, wheeling self) or having someone come in and assist the resident (with ADLs, oxygen, catheter, or ostomy).The findings on admission and retention policies regarding physical and cognitive care needs suggest that assisted living is serving as part of a continuum of care rather than a setting where residents can age in place and remain until death. A small number of residents do return to independent living or die in the setting as suggested by the reason for discharge findings. However, most administrators report that nursing facility placement and hospitalization (often followed by nursing facility placement) are the most common outcomes for those who leave the facility.By comparing the implementation of one state's assisted living policies to assisted living policies nationally, we can conclude that the role assisted living plays in the long-term care continuum definitely differs from state to state. For example, in some states (e.g., Florida) assisted living serves a range of care needs up to and including higher acuity nursing facility level of care (Vinton, Crook, and LeMaster 1997   ). However, in informal interviews with Kansas assisted living providers, we found that their rationale for serving a less impaired physical and cognitive population is that they strive to meet the preferences of most residents and provide them with the kind of noninstitutional care environment they desire.Hawes and associates 1999   (p. 66) highlighted a variety of forces that "militate against assisted living facilities serving as an alternative to nursing homes." These forces include residents that prefer settings that do not look at all like nursing facilities, concerns of state regulators that assisted living will become too highly regulated like nursing facilities, political influence of the nursing home lobby, and perceptions of assisted living owners and administrators about the niche they fill in the long-term care continuum (Hawes et al. 1999   ).The estimated average length of stay in assisted living facilities reported by facility administrators in Kansas of 2.36 years implies that the capacity to age in place in Kansas is limited for many residents. Some experts in the long-term care field suggest that assisted living in Kansas is still a rather new phenomenon compared with other states and that older adults will begin to utilize assisted living at a much greater rate for longer periods of time in the coming years (Kansas Department of Health and Environment, personal communication, P. Maben, March 1999). Study Limitations The study had some limitations that should be considered. First, there was potential reporting error in the administrators' responses to the questions asking whether they would admit or retain residents who were mildly confused and significantly cognitively impaired. Although the categories were initially chosen from the familiar codes used in the national Resident Assessment Instrument, MDS Version 2.0, under cognitive skills for daily decision making (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1996   , p. 94), a bias may have resulted from the administrators' not having a formal definition of these criteria.We collected an estimated average length of stay from assisted living facility administrators and did not collect exact resident length of stay (from admission to discharge for a resident sample) and, therefore, cannot determine exactly how long residents are aging in place in assisted living settings. As suggested by our facility admission and retention policy findings, resident functional, cognitive, and health conditions are factors in determining resident length of stay. In a current longitudinal study we are conducting that focuses on the capacity for residents to age in place in assisted living facilities, we are collecting resident functional, cognitive, and health information from admission to discharge to determine exact length of stay and the factors that influence length of stay. Areas for Future Research The examination of the relationship between additional facility characteristics and resident length of stay is an area for future study. As mentioned previously, we are currently conducting a longitudinal analysis of resident length of stay and how facility factors are associated with increased lengths of stay in assisted living settings. The factors that are included in the study are size, cost, services offered, staffing patterns, geographic location, and admission and retention policies. This project will allow us to determine what types of assisted living facilities are more successful than others in implementing an aging-in-place philosophy.Additionally, current research has not fully explored how important it is to older adults that assisted living provide the opportunity to age in place rather than function as an intermediate step in the long-term care continuum. Some older adults may prefer a care environment with residents who have mild levels of impairment and who look similar to them in other ways (e.g., socially, physically, and cognitively), knowing that if their condition deteriorates, there is a strong possibility that they will have to relocate to a place that serves a higher level of care. In contrast, other older adults may prefer to live in a care environment where their needs can be met until the end of life and do not object to a resident population that has a broad range of impairments. The preferences of older adults in this regard need to be explored. Implications for educating older adults to become informed about the extent to which a facility will allow them to age in place prior to admission need to be considered. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that, overall, Kansas assisted living facilities are functioning as an intermediate step in the long-term care continuum. Our findings suggest that less restrictive assisted living admission and retention policies, given adequate staffing and funding, could increase opportunities for aging in place. These findings have implications for policymakers nationwide who are interested in more fully supporting aging in place.State long-term care policymakers need to consider how facility practices reflect existing state policies. Even though the Kansas regulatory structure allows for residents with a broad range of care needs to age in place in assisted living settings, we found that this is not happening because facility practices do not fully reflect existing state policies. Nationwide, we found that assisted living facilities are admitting and retaining people with a wider range of care needs, compared with Kansas assisted living facilities.If elderly persons across the United States are to have increased opportunity to age in place in assisted living settings, then many facilities will need to consider expanding some of their admission and retention policies. For example, admitting and retaining residents with incontinence problems (realizing that staffing needs to be appropriate to assist with incontinence problems) would allow residents to age in place longer. Admitting and retaining residents with severe cognitive impairments would also create an avenue for a vulnerable elderly population to age in place. In our Kansas study we did find a smaller proportion of Alzheimer's disease units and dementia-only facilities than was found in the national NIC study. It is likely that these specialized accommodations will become increasingly popular residential alternatives nationwide. Facilities that decide to increase flexibility in admitting and retaining the more severely cognitively impaired population will need specialized training and resources for staff to help them deal with older adults who have severe cognitive impairments. Also, flexible payment structures offered by some states provide an incentive for facilities to accept low-income older adults receiving or pending Medicaid HCBS/FE, thus allowing opportunities for Medicaid HCBS/FE recipients to age in place in assisted living settings.Studies have indicated that there is overlap in the population that is at the higher acuity end of assisted living and the lower acuity end of nursing facilities (e.g., the population that needs assistance with two to three ADLs; Chapin et al. 1999   ; Hawes et al. 1999   ). More empirical research is needed to determine how similar the assisted living and nursing facility population needing assistance with two to three ADLs may be and whether this subset of older adults in nursing facilities, with adequate staffing and resources, could potentially be served in assisted living settings.As the aging population grows in number and the average life expectancy increases, assisted living as a long-term care alternative will be more in demand. Some professionals have argued that assisted living can provide a cost-effective alternative for a subset of older adults needing long-term care, while still maintaining their autonomy and dignity (Citro and Hermanson 1999   ; Wilson 1996   ). Although assisted living settings as a long-term care option have become increasingly popular with older adults, it is essential for policymakers to continue to track changes in admission and retention policies in assisted living settings and to consider the implications of these policies for older adults and their families.

     Abstract The authors interviewed adults in five ethnic groups, used factor analysis to quantify attitudes toward planning for death, and used path analysis to test the relative influence of respondent characteristics, including ethnicity, and attitude factors (Advocacy to Discuss/Document Wishes, Trust in Family and Physician to Make Decisions, Reliance on Religious Guidance, Fears and Anxiety About Life's End, and Fatalism About Death's Timing) on support for physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Findings verified that attitude factors had a direct effect on PAS support but that, contrary to the hypothesis, ethnicity had a direct effect on support for PAS as well.   Asian Americans ,  Beliefs ,  Culture ,  Death ,  Euthanasia ,  Fatalism ,  Religiosity Vernon L. Greene, PhDResearch has suggested that support for physician-assisted suicide (PAS) varies by ethnicity and that these variations may be associated with the cultural values and sociohistorical experiences of an ethnic group, which, in turn, influence attitudes toward planning for death (Braun, Pietsch, and Blanchette 2000   ). The purpose of this study was to identify these attitudinal constructs and test their usefulness in explaining documented differences in support for PAS among ethnic groups in Honolulu. Literature Review Physician-Assisted Suicide National surveys about legalizing euthanasia usually distinguish between voluntary active euthanasia (VAE), in which a physician administers a lethal dose to hasten death of a patient at his or her request, and PAS, in which a physician provides the requesting patient with the means to end his or her own life. Definitions of PAS vary slightly in wording from study to study, but all contain these elements: (a) prescription of medication (many definitions specify "lethal drug" or "lethal dose"), (b) by a physician, (c) to be used by the patient, (d) with the intent to end his or her own life (Back, Wallace, Starks, and Pearlman 1996   ; Benson 1999   ; Cohen, Fihn, Boyko, Jonsen, and Wood 1994   ; Lee and associates 1996   ; Meier, Emmons, Wallenstein, Quill, Morrison, and Cassel 1998   ).In a review of data from national polls, Benson 1999    noted that 45% to 59% of Americans now support PAS. Several states have taken the issue to their polling places and courts; Oregon legalized PAS in 1997 (Chin, Hedberg, Higginson, and Flemming 1999   ). Despite this trend, it is important to note that PAS does not carry the same appeal in all ethnic groups. For example, Singh 1979    found that 40% of African Americans felt that a physician should be allowed to help a terminally ill patient die if he or she so requested compared with 65% of Caucasians. In the same survey, only 21% of African Americans (compared with 42% of Caucasians) felt a person with an incurable illness had a right to end his or her own life. Similarly, in a survey of Michigan residents, researchers found that 76% of Caucasian respondents supported the legalization of PAS compared with only 56% of African American respondents (Lichtenstein, Alcser, Corning, Bachman, and Doukas 1997   ). Ethnic variation may, in some cases, reflect the religious traditions of an ethnic group. For example, the majority of Hispanic and Filipino Americans are Catholic. Catholic doctrine affirms the dignity and sanctity of human life and the sovereignty of God over it, and thus prohibits suicide (John Paul II 1995   ; National Conference of Catholic Bishops 1994   ; Vatican 1980   ).Still, one's specific ethnicity or religion is not a sure predictor of support, or nonsupport, for PAS. For example, a survey by the Tarrance Group 1994    found that only 73% of Catholics who attend mass weekly opposed PAS because of religious beliefs, and Singh 1979    found that strong religious commitment and frequent religious service attendance, regardless of religion, were associated with low support of PAS. In fact, once Lichtenstein and associates 1997    included a measure of religiosity in their model, "race, age, and sex no longer had a significant effect on support for legalization of physician-assisted suicide" (pp. 129–130). Attitudes Toward Planning for Death Distinctions among values, attitudes, and behaviors have been articulated by Rokeach 1975   . Individual behavior is influenced by attitudes, which are described as "relatively enduring organization[s] of interrelated beliefs that describe, evaluate, and advocate action with respect to an object or situation" (p.132). Attitudes provide individuals with a frame of reference; attitudes may be selective, biased, and resistant to change, but they can be modified in the face of new evidence. Values and beliefs, more basic than attitudes because they are abstract ideals unrelated to a specific object or situation, often underlie attitudes. An individual's value system is ordered out of cultural, religious, institutional, and social influences (Rokeach 1975   ). Thus, attitudes are based on values and underlie behaviors.The current study attempted to articulate and measure attitudes toward planning for death. This exploration is important, as empirical data and everyday experience verify that individuals are unique and that within-ethnic-group differences in end-of-life attitudes and practices may vary as much as, or more than, between-ethnic-group differences. To learn more about ethnic differences in end-of-life planning and the underlying constructs that may affect end-of-life choices, several studies were conducted in Honolulu on a multiethnic sample. Early work (conducted in 1995 through 1996) was qualitative, using focus groups and key informant interviews. This was followed in 1997 by structured interviews with 245 adults; partial findings from this study are reported in this article.The 1995–1996 qualitative study involved respondents from five ethnic groups—Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Hawaiian, and Vietnamese—and found differences in attitudes toward planning for death among, and within, these groups. Differences reflected respondents' varying cultural and religious traditions, degree of religiosity, educational attainment, experience with artificial prolongation of life of family members, trust in family and the health care system, and number of generations the individuals' families had lived in the United States (Braun and Nichols 1997   ).In response to questions about euthanasia (participants were not asked specifically about PAS), this investigation revealed that all of the respondents' religions had prohibitions against killing. But this was interpreted differently by participants depending on their own experience with death and dying. For example, many Filipino participants who were first-generation immigrants and primarily Catholic said that euthanasia and suicide would go against God's commandments and show a distrust of God's plan for one's life. Yet those Filipino respondents who worked in health care, including a first-generation Filipino Catholic nun, expressed an acceptance of withholding futile treatment and of giving adequate medication to relieve pain even if this act might fatally suppress respiration. Japanese participants, most of whom were born in Hawaii, told stories of very long-lived relatives who had required years of care and had died with "too many tubes." Although they noted that Buddhism was against killing, they also acknowledged two concepts from the Japanese language that would support the withholding or withdrawing of futile treatment: shikata ga nai, which means "nothing can be done" or "it cannot be helped," and akirameru, meaning "to leave things as they are" or "to let things proceed naturally." Many Native Hawaiian participants (those who trace their ancestry back before first contact with Caucasians) expressed distrust of the government and the health care system, voicing concern that legalizing euthanasia may result in poorer care for economically disadvantaged members of this ethnic group. Chinese respondents referred to a traditional view of suicide as something that would bring "bad luck" on the family. But one related a story about a relative who had been on life support for several years and how this experience helped the family distinguish between refusing, withholding, or withdrawing technology and suicide; all family members had since completed advance directives. Across ethnic groups were concerns about being in pain, being dependent, being a burden, and being impoverished at life's end, and these individuals seemed supportive of euthanasia as a way to gain control over the dying process. Other participants noted a strong cultural norm that planning or talking about death could make it happen or would suggest disregard for God's plan or one's karma. Others were strong advocates of discussing and documenting wishes regarding the end of life. Others were not concerned about their own wishes but trusted that family and doctor would make the right decisions when the time came. Still others said they did not know how they felt about planning for death or aid in dying but that they would want to seek guidance from their church or minister on these issues (Braun and Nichols 1997   ).On the basis of the findings from this qualitative study, we hypothesized that one's end-of-life behaviors would be influenced by several sets of variables. Ethnic membership, certainly, is associated with cultural and religious values that comprise the value system that underlies individuals' attitudes toward end-of-life planning. One's lived experience—immigrant status, education, exposure to life-prolonging technology—may cause one to modify one's attitudes. We hypothesized six potential attitude factors: Advocacy to Discuss/Document Wishes, Wanting to Control One's Death, Trust in Others to Make the Right Decisions, Reliance on Religious Guidance at the End of Life, Fears and Anxieties About Life's End, and Fatalism About Death's Timing. We hypothesized that these factors, rather than ethnic or religious membership per se, would account for variance in support for PAS and that this finding could help minimize ethnic and religious stereotyping in favor of a more sophisticated modeling of how culturally and religiously influenced attitudes affect end-of-life decision making. Methods Sample The study design called for face-to-face interviews with 50 adults (25 who were at least 60 years old and, for each, an adult child) in each of five ethnic groups—Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Native Hawaiian, and Japanese—for a total sample of 250. These represent the five largest ethnic groups in Hawaii, where Caucasians comprise only about 26% of the state's population; Japanese, 23%; Native Hawaiian, 19%; Filipino, 15%; and Chinese, 6%. Other ethnic groups in Hawaii include African American, Korean, Micronesian, Puerto Rican, Samoan, Southeast Asian, and Tongan, but each comprises 3% or less of the total population and was excluded from this study.Although interviews were conducted in English, student interviewers were of the same ethnic background as the group they interviewed except for the student assigned to interview the Hawaiian group, who was a young Caucasian born and raised in a Hawaiian community. Interviewers first identified senior participants through senior centers, churches, and social organizations in Honolulu that tended to attract members of a specific ethnic group. Participating seniors then identified an adult child willing to be interviewed; children were of the same ethnicity as their parents. This sampling strategy was pursued to allow testing of generational differences in end-of-life practices, as previous work suggested that adult children differ in beliefs and practices from their parents (Braun and Nichols 1997   ; Kalish and Reynolds 1976   ). Also, seniors tend to congregate in groups that are ethnically homogeneous, whereas middle-aged Hawaii residents are more likely to be living and working in integrated settings. Although Hawaii is an ethnically integrated state where 60% of newborns are of mixed race (Hawaii Department of Health 1998   ), care was taken to select participants for this study who were not of mixed race. The exception was for Native Hawaiians, because less than half a percent of this ethnic group is full Hawaiian. In this case, participants were recruited from senior centers and service programs that serve Native Hawaiian homestead communities.Caucasian, Japanese, and Filipino participants were easily identified and interviewed. Hawaiian and Chinese participants were harder to recruit; the two students interviewing these groups estimated that they asked 4 adults for each 1 who agreed. The Chinese-group interviewer reported that the high refusal among Chinese participants was due to discomfort with the topic of death, expressing concerns that talking about death would bring bad luck. Thus, Chinese participants likely represent the more acculturated members of this ethnic group. The student interviewing Native Hawaiians reported high levels of distrust, which took time to overcome. Even though he had been born and raised in Hawaii, he needed to spend time "talking story" with potential interviewees before consent would be provided. Once given, however, Hawaiian respondents appeared to share their feelings openly. In nine cases, a direct parent–child pair could not be interviewed, sometimes because the adult child did not have time to participate or lived out of state; instead, another close relative (e.g., a niece, nephew, or adult grandchild) of the older adult was interviewed. Interviews were completed within 5 months for a final sample of 245 adults (125 seniors and 120 adult children) in the five ethnic groups (48 Caucasians, 48 Chinese, 50 Filipinos, 50 Native Hawaiians, and 49 Japanese). The limitation of the sample for generalizing results is acknowledged. But given the exploratory nature of the study—that is, to identify and measure attitudes toward planning for death—we felt it to be adequate. Of the 245 study participants, 202 said either "yes" or "no" (rather than "perhaps") to the question about support for PAS, and analysis related to PAS was limited to this group. Measures The full four-part interview schedule included 85 questions. Respondent characteristics included age, gender, birthplace, educational attainment, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and experience with life-threatening illness and family caregiving. A series of questions asked about advance directive knowledge and completion and reasons for completing one or not. The third section included 25 items designed to capture attitudes toward end-of-life planning, each scored on a 5-point Likert scale; these were developed directly from findings from the 1995–1996 qualitative study. The final section focused on PAS. Our definition (a doctor providing a patient with the means to end his or her own life, such as a drug that can be lethal in certain doses) contained all the elements from definitions used by others—prescription of medication (many definitions specify "lethal drug" or "lethal dose"), by a physician, to be used by the patient, with the intent to end his or her own life. Respondents were asked, "Is there any condition under which this should be allowed?" If the participant answered "no," questioning was concluded. If the participant answered "yes" or "perhaps," another 29 questions were asked about possible conditions (e.g., should the requester be over 18? have a terminal illness? be in pain? need a second opinion? need agreement from family? Braun 1998   ). At the conclusion of the interview, the participant was thanked and offered a $10 gift certificate. Analysis Many social phenomena are conceived of as processes operating among underlying constructs. Factor analysis is a statistical procedure commonly used to test one's conceptualization of these constructs or theoretical abstractions (Heck 1998   ), and in this study we used it to obtain more clarity about attitudes toward planning for death. We hypothesized that underlying factors would likely represent constructs such as advocacy for discussing/documenting wishes, wanting to control one's death, trust in others, reliance on religious guidance, fears and anxieties about life's end, and fatalism about death's timing; 25 items were included to measure these constructs. Once data collection was completed, we performed a factor analysis with SPSS (SPSS, Inc 1999   ) using principal-axis factoring with oblimin rotation. Several criteria were used to judge the model's fit: (a) the percentage of variance explained was reasonably high (>50%), (b) factors had eigenvalues greater than 1.0, (c) factors consisted of four or more items, and (d) factors were conceptually sound with low or low–moderate levels of intercorrelation. Once the best solution was obtained, the reliability of each factor was determined by using Cronbach's alpha (a measure of internal consistency) and factor scores were produced (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1).A correlation matrix developed with SPSS was used to examine relationships among ethnicity, other characteristics, attitudes, and PAS support. Ethnicities were Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, and Japanese, and other characteristics were generation (senior vs adult child), religion (Catholic or not), immigrant status (yes or no), educational attainment (measured on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 = less than 9th grade to 7 = graduate school), and personal or family experience with life-threatening illness, caregiving, intensive care unit (ICU), or hospice (from 0 to 4).We tested the path model with Mplus (Muthen and Muthen 1998   ), a comprehensive statistical modeling program that offers a diverse set of statistical models incorporating categorical and continuous observed and latent variables. In path analysis, the observed dependent variables may be continuous, categorical, or a combination of continuous and categorical. In this study, the dependent variable, PAS support, was binary; those who said "yes" when asked if there was any condition under which PAS should be allowed were coded 1; those who said "no" were coded 0. (As noted earlier, the 43 participants who said "perhaps" were excluded from this analysis.) In the general modeling framework of Mplus, binary dependent variables are reformulated as latent, continuous response variables (y*). This makes it possible to maintain linear relationships among the variables in the model (i.e., as opposed to a nonlinear relationship between x and y, using logistic regression with a binary dependent variable). In the binary case, the latent response variable formulation defines a threshold τ on y* so that y = 1 is observed when y* exceeds τ; otherwise, y = 0 is observed. A linear regression equation is used to relate y* to x: y* = πx + δ, where π is a slope parameter and δ is a residual that is uncorrelated with x. An intercept term is not needed because of the threshold parameter τ. The y* formulation for the binary dependent variable, PAS support, in our model therefore focuses on changes in the values of the continuous latent response variable y*. An R2 may also be defined, which is slightly different from an R2 of regression with a continuous variable because the variance of the error term in the latent response formulation is not a free parameter. The path coefficients reported are standardized, and the significance of each parameter was determined (i.e., for p < .05, the ratio of the parameter to its standard error was 1.96 or greater, and for p < .10, the ratio of the parameter to its standard error was 1.65). Results Respondent Characteristics Of the 245 study participants, 202 answered either "yes" or "no" to the question on PAS support. Excluded because they responded "perhaps" were 5 Hawaiian respondents, 8 Chinese respondents, and 10 each of Filipino, Japanese, and Caucasian respondents. Sample characteristics (N = 202) are shown in  Table 1  , by ethnic group. None of the Caucasians or Hawaiians were first-generation immigrants to the United States (as expected), compared with 27% of Chinese, 68% of Filipino, and 5% of Japanese respondents. None of the Japanese were Catholic compared with 13% of Chinese, 26% of Caucasian, 29% of Hawaiian, and 90% of Filipino respondents. (Japanese respondents were primarily Buddhist; other non-Catholics were Protestant.) Only 38% of the Filipino, Hawaiian, and Japanese respondents were college graduates, compared with 56% of Caucasians and 63% of Chinese. Filipinos were least likely and Hawaiians most likely to have experience with life-threatening illness, caregiving, ICU, or hospice among the five ethnic groups. These interethnic differences were not surprising and reflect statewide estimates. Gender and age distributions were similar across ethnic groups; about two thirds of all respondents were female, the mean age of senior participants was 73, and the mean age of adult children was 42 (not shown in  Table 1  ). Dependent Variable Support of PAS by ethnic group is shown in  Table 1  as well. Significant differences were seen by ethnic group, with only 33% of Filipinos and 51% of Hawaiians supporting PAS, compared with 74% of Caucasian, 77% of Chinese, and 90% of Japanese respondents, χ2 (df = 4, N = 202) = 36.5, p < .001. Although the sample was not randomly selected, it is important to note that a similar ethnic distribution was found in response to a question on ending one's life included in a 1998 statewide, random-sample survey ("Do you think that a person has a moral right to end his/her life, when faced with an incurable illness?), lowest among Filipinos (45%) and Hawaiians (54%) and higher among Caucasians (70%), Chinese (71%), and Japanese (75%; A. T. Onaka, personal communication, March 1, 2000). Factor Analysis Using principal-axis factoring with oblimin rotation, the 25 items first yielded six factors, explaining 60% of the variance. Although all factors had eigenvalues of greater than 1.0, they did not make clear conceptual sense. For example, the sixth factor had only one substantive loading, eight items loaded on two factors, and one item did not load on any factor. Several items were eliminated, and the next analysis, using 21 items, yielded five conceptually clear factors explaining 59% of the variance. The solution is shown in  Table 2  under these factor labels: Discuss/Document, Trust, Fears, Religious Guidance, and Fatalism. The Cronbach's alphas for the factors ranged from .66 to .78. Correlations Factors representing the five attitudinal factors were intercorrelated to test for their distinctiveness. The correlation matrix, shown in  Table 3  , suggests that the factors were reasonably distinctive, although Advocacy to Discuss/Document Wishes was negatively correlated with Fears (r = −.23, p < .01) and Fatalism (r = −.30, p < .01), and Fatalism was positively correlated with Trust (r = .23, p < .05).Correlations between PAS support, attitudinal factor scores, and respondent characteristics (including ethnicity) are shown in  Table 3  as well. The outcome—support for PAS—was significantly correlated with many of the other independent variables, including four of the attitudinal factors (positively with Discuss/Document and negatively with Fears, Religious Guidance, and Fatalism). Support for PAS also correlated positively with Education, Experience, and Japanese ancestry and negatively with Immigrant, Catholic, and Filipino ancestry. As expected, the attitudinal factors were significantly associated with respondent characteristics, including ethnicity. Specifically, Discuss/Document correlated negatively with immigrant status and Filipino ancestry and positively with Education. Trust correlated positively with senior generation and negatively with Education and Caucasian ancestry. Fears about life's end correlated positively with Hawaiian ancestry and negatively with Filipino ancestry. Reliance on religious guidance correlated positively with Catholic faith and Filipino ancestry and negatively with Chinese ancestry. Fatalism correlated positively with immigrant status, Catholic faith, and Filipino ancestry and negatively with education and Caucasian ancestry. There also were significant correlations among respondent characteristics, as expected from data shown in  Table 1  . Path Model Results of the path model are shown in  Table 4  . The significant paths are summarized in  Fig. 1 . First, the findings support the notion that respondent characteristics, including ethnicity, were associated with attitudinal factors. Specifically, those more likely to advocate discussing/documenting wishes were Catholic and had more years of education. The Trust factor was positively associated with Filipino or Japanese ancestry and senior generation and negatively with immigrant status. Senior generation and Hawaiian or Filipino ancestry were associated with the Religious Guidance factor. The Fears factor was negatively associated with Filipino ancestry and education. The Fatalism factor was positively associated with Chinese or Filipino ancestry and negatively associated with education and immigrant status. The R2s for the Discuss/Document, Trust, Religious Guidance, Fears, and Fatalism factors were .08, .14, .14, .13, and .15, respectively. Second, the full model supports the notion that attitudinal factors influence PAS support. Specifically, PAS support was associated with four attitudinal factors: Discuss/Document (positive), Religious Guidance (negative), Fears (positive), and Fatalism (negative).Contrary to the hypothesis, however, ethnic membership was directly associated with PAS support; that is, individuals of Filipino and Hawaiian ancestry were less likely than others to support PAS even after controlling for other respondent characteristics and attitudinal factors. The R2 for the full model was .45. Discussion The analyses suggest that attitudes toward planning for death may be useful in helping explain support for PAS, but ethnic differences in support were still seen. This finding may mean that real ethnic differences in PAS support exist in the Honolulu community, that the conceptualization of the attitudinal factors was limited, or that measures of respondent characteristics were inadequate. These possibilities will be discussed.First, what is known about the Filipino American group that may explain the direct effect seen on PAS support by Filipino ancestry? Similarly to Hispanic Americans, Filipino Americans are from a country once under Spanish rule (for about 300 years), and the majority are Catholic and relatively recent immigrants to the United States. Within this study, the Filipino group had the largest proportion of first-generation immigrants, had no respondents with graduate degrees (compared with 18%–37% of other groups), and had the least amount of experience with life-threatening illness and family caregiving. Thus, they were probably the least acculturated of the groups to the ways of dying in the United States and the most likely to consider their traditional values in response to questions about end-of-life planning. Important Filipino values include bahala na (the belief that most things are outside individual control and in the hands of God), utang na loob (debt of gratitude within relationships, e.g., of children toward their parents), and an avoidance of hiya (shame caused by losing face; Ponce and Forman 1980   ). Some of these values were reflected in the model's attitudinal factors. For example, the positive association between Filipino ancestry and fatalism about death's timing fits with the concept of bahala na. The positive association with trust in others to make decisions and the negative association with fears/anxieties at life's end fit with the concept of utang na loob (i.e., why be anxious when one's children are indebted to do their best by you?) The positive association with religious guidance is in line with the important role of church and Catholic doctrine among Filipinos. Not captured by the model, perhaps, were items that reflected the strong belief that "suicide is a sin," the shame (hiya) that suicide would bring to the family, and fears about the implications of suicide on funeral and burial practices. These notions were expressed by Filipino American participants in our earlier qualitative studies.The other group that did not fit the proposed model was Native Hawaiians. Similarly to other Native Americans, Native Hawaiians have experienced a loss of land and power and several centuries of disenfranchisement and discrimination within their traditional homeland. Although Native Hawaiians live in communities throughout the state, "Hawaiian homestead" communities (those in which land and housing are available at a reduced price) are located in rural areas that are far from major medical centers. Perhaps most applicable to this study are the facts that Native Hawaiians have the worst health status, are least likely to have comprehensive health insurance, and have the shortest life expectancy of the major ethnic groups in the state (Blaisdell 1993   ; Blaisdell and Mokuau 1991   ). The fact that few Native Hawaiians live to be seniors is reflected in the age structure of this group; whereas Native Hawaiians comprise 19% of the general population in the state, they comprise only 7% of the population age 60 and older (Hawaii Executive Office on Aging 1995   ). Thus, the model may not have adequately captured a sense of forced extinction that is likely felt by many Native Hawaiians and that would logically lead them to oppose PAS.Despite this, we believe that effort to articulate attitudes related to end-of-life planning should be pursued. The factor analysis procedure was successful in identifying five relatively distinct constructs—Advocacy to Discuss/Document End-of-Life Wishes, Trust in Others to Make Decisions, Reliance on Religious Guidance at the End of Life, Fears and Anxieties About Life's End, and Fatalism About Death's Timing—from items that emerged from qualitative research in this area. We believe that this work, if expanded and refined, may lead to a mechanism for measuring attitudes related to end-of-life practices that are sometimes attributed to ethnic membership, and may in fact stem from specific cultural and religious traditions, but that have been modified through individuals' encounters with various social, political, educational, and health care systems.Since this study was conceptualized, other investigators have published work on attitudes and end-of-life issues. For example, research has suggested that individuals across ethnic groups may feel that talking about something or taking an action might bring "bad luck." This is reflected in the adage "Don't count your chickens before they hatch." Specifically related to end-of-life practices, in focus groups conducted in New York (with separate groups for Caucasian, African, and Hispanic Americans), some members of each group believed that "completing a health care proxy form could actually bring on an adverse medical outcome" (Morrison, Zayas, Mulvihill, Baskin, and Meier 1998   , p. 122). Carrese and Rhodes 1995    also found concern that completing an advance directive might chance fate in a study of Navajo. In the current study, fatalism was negatively associated with PAS support. Two of the ethnic groups—Chinese and Filipinos—were associated with a more fatalistic attitude toward the timing of death, either in terms of tempting early death by talking about it or trusting that the timing of one's death was in control of larger forces. It makes sense that education was negatively associated with the Fatalism factor. Immigrant status was negatively associated as well, which is in line with Brislin 1981   , who found that people who emigrate often have a greater internal locus of control than their counterparts who stay home and that successful immigrants show an increase in the belief that "problems can be addressed through individual effort rather than left to fate or chance" (p. 306).Also explored by other investigators was the relationship between support for PAS and the fear of becoming dependent or burdensome at life's end. For example, Chin and associates 1999    found that Oregon residents who requested PAS expressed more concern about loss of autonomy and control of bodily functions than did the study's control patients who died from similar diseases but without PAS. Blendon, Szalay, and Knox 1992    found that the fear of burdening families was the main reason that survey respondents considered alternatives to end their lives if terminally ill. These authors also noted that other common end-of-life fears for Americans include becoming a financial burden, living in pain, being dependent on machines, and ending up in a nursing home. Similarly, the current study found a positive association between support for PAS and fears and anxieties about life's end. This factor was negatively associated with education and with Filipino ancestry, likely for reasons of high intrafamily reliance and utang na loob, as described earlier.A measure of religiosity is often included in studies of end-of-life attitudes and practices. Singh 1979    measured religiosity in terms of frequency of church attendance and found that strong religious commitment and frequent religious attendance, regardless of religion, were associated with low support of PAS. Lichtenstein and colleagues 1997    operationalized religiosity as "importance of religion in your life" and found it to be the only independent variable in their study significantly associated with support for PAS. The current study included four attitudinal items about the importance of religious guidance at the end of life ( Table 2  ) and found that the measure was negatively associated with support for PAS. As others have found, senior generation was positively associated with religiosity (Kalish and Reynolds 1976   ). Filipino and Hawaiian ancestry were also both positively associated with seeking religious guidance at life's end. As noted earlier, Catholic church and doctrine strongly influence the Filipino worldview. Spirituality is important among Hawaiians as well, as it is closely integrated with the care of the land (aina) and living in harmony (lokahi) with the environment (Dudley 1990   ; Mokuau and Browne 1994   ).The Discuss/Document factor was positively associated with support for PAS. However, it was the least well-explained factor in the model (R2 = .08). That it was positively associated with education was not surprising. Its association with Catholic faith was not expected, however, as within the sample, smaller proportions of Catholics reported having a will (53% vs 65% of non-Catholics), living will (45% vs 59% of non-Catholics), or durable power of attorney (24% vs 38% of non-Catholics). Also, there was a significant negative correlation between the Fatalism and Discuss/Document factors (r = −.30, p < .01). This may suggest that these two factors may tap opposite ends of a continuum between internal and external locus of control regarding end-of-life planning. Specifically, individuals with a high internal locus of control would be more likely to believe in taking actions to influence the quality or timing of their deaths, whereas individuals with a high external locus of control would be less likely to plan for death, leaving this in the hands of a higher power. This hypothesis could be tested by co-administering a locus-of-control instrument (Rotter 1973   ; Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan, and Maides 1976   ).The current study found no relationship between trust in others to make decisions and PAS support. In a similar exploration, McKinley, Garrett, Evans, and Danis 1996    hypothesized that a cultural history of discrimination and unequal access to care might result in feelings of distrust in the health care system by African Americans and might explain why African Americans, compared with Caucasians, were more likely to desire life-sustaining treatments and less likely to have plans to complete a living will. They found, however, that trust was not correlated with these outcomes. In fact, 96% of both groups said they trusted the health care system and only 16%–19% of both groups feared inadequate medical care. As suggested by McKinley and associates 1996   , the operationalization of this factor needs more refinement. Both studies used a combination of global questions (e.g., "Generally speaking, doctors can be trusted") and personal questions (e.g., "If fatally ill, I would rely on my doctor to make the right decisions for me"), and perhaps the two need to be separated. Also, the current study mixed questions about trust in physicians and trust in family members, which should be separated. The former is linked to trust in the health care system and degree to which one feels it will honor one's wishes. The latter may be tapping how individuals make decisions (e.g., by themselves, with the help of an intimate partner, by deferring to someone else, with concern for the good of the whole family).Strengthening this line of work on attitudes toward end-of-life planning may be a measure of death anxiety. For example, the Death Attitude Profile—Revised includes measures of death acceptance (neutral acceptance, approach acceptance, and escape acceptance), fear of death, and death avoidance (Wong, Reker, and Gesser 1994   ). It is likely that all five of these constructs are influenced by cultural traditions and, in turn, influence end-of-life choices. Relevant items from the Wong and associates' scale include "I avoid thinking about death altogether" and "I try to have nothing to do with the subject of death."Other variables included in the study could benefit from additional refinement as well. The operationalization of the Experience variable was perhaps too broad, including personal and family experience with serious illness, caregiving, ICU, and hospice. More promising may be to measure negativity associated with these experiences, as study participants reported in response to open-ended questions that having a negative experience watching a family member die spurred them to take a more active role in thinking about and planning for death. Another relevant predictor might be current health status, which was not included in this study.The study was limited by the small size and nonrandom selection of its sample. Participation was voluntary, and recruitment difficulties among Chinese (for reasons of discomfort with the topic) and Hawaiians (who took time to "check out" the interviewer before consenting to an interview) suggest that the study's data reflect the thoughts of individuals within each group who were most open to talking about death and dying with a stranger. However, as noted earlier, a question on an individual's right to end his or her life if terminally ill included in a random sample, statewide survey found a similar distribution of support by ethnicity as this study found for PAS support—lower among Filipinos and Hawaiians and higher among Caucasians, Chinese, and Japanese.For practitioners, the findings underscore the importance of two things: (a) learning about the values and experiences of the different ethnic groups with which one works and (b) taking a good history. Numerous books and articles are appearing that provide information on different cultures, identify important cultural values, and examine how these values may influence health-related behaviors (Braun et al. 2000   ; Kalish and Reynolds 1976   ; Koenig 1997   ). Taking a good history includes asking open-ended questions about a person's education and experience but, more important, about their level of religiosity, their propensity to plan ahead, support for discussing/documenting wishes, the extent to which they feel that their death is part of a larger plan or outside of their control, if they think discussing death will bring it on, and how much they would like to share or give away decision-making power. We agree with other investigators who recommend that practitioners not delay talking with patients about end-of-life issues. Such discussions should be initiated after getting to know a patient but before the patient becomes ill (Miles, Koepp, and Weber 1996   ) and can be facilitated by the use of values history instruments (Doukas and McCullough 1991   ; McIver-Gibson 1990   ). Although the current emphasis on cultural competence is important and is aided by gaining knowledge about the history and values of a specific culture, it is imperative that practitioners not use information about cultural norms to stereotype individual patients. Rather, by asking open-ended questions related to individual beliefs and attitudes (that may indeed be influenced by that individual's ethnic membership), a practitioner will likely get a more complete and useful picture of the patient on which a good helping relationship at the end of life can be established. Conclusion Several investigators have found that many U.S. minority groups feel and act differently than the dominant North American culture when it comes to end-of-life decision making. Although there is clear proof of general ethnic-specific differences, empirical and everyday evidence acknowledge a range of within-group differences as well. This study presents a broader, empirical approach to the issue by trying to identify and measure attitudinal factors related to PAS support that may apply across ethnic groups. Although five attitudinal factors were identified, contrary to the hypothesis ethnic membership was directly associated with PAS support, that is, individuals of Filipino and Hawaiian ancestry were less likely than others to support PAS even after controlling for other respondent characteristics and attitudinal factors. Although further refinement of the conceptual model and its measurement is needed, this study offers a step toward clarifying and enhancing understanding of cultural influences on end-of-life choices. Practitioners are encouraged to learn about the cultural traditions of the people they serve and to ask open-ended questions that will elicit underlying attitudes that influence end-of-life behavior.

     Abstract Purpose: This article focuses on why it is important for long-term care ombudsmen to collect resident demographics. Design and Methods: The authors analyzed a cross-sectional, 6-state database to show the importance of ombudsman programs' collecting demographic information about the residents of long-term care facilities whom they serve. To demonstrate the importance of collecting demographic data about residents, the authors examined the relationships between race, gender, and types of complaints lodged, verified, and fully resolved. Results: A higher percentage of complaints lodged on behalf of racial minorities was verified, yet a lower percentage was fully resolved. Implications: Ombudsman databases are a potential resource for identifying residents' characteristics that increase their vulnerability in long-term care settings.   Elder abuse ,  Race ,  Gender ,  Nursing homes Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program was established by the Congress in the early 1970s as a mandate of the Older Americans Act. Referred to as a "community presence in long-term care facilities" (Cherry 1993   , p. 336) ombudsmen identify, investigate, and resolve individual and systems level complaints that affect long-term care residents. As the program has grown, some states have expanded their ombudsmen's scope of practice to include board and care homes as well as home and community-based services. Ombudsmen include both paid staff and volunteers located under various agency and community auspices (Huber, Netting, and Kautz 1996   ). Interest in the ombudsman program has increased over the years (American Association of Retired Persons 1994   ; Cherry 1991   , Cherry 1993   ; Connor and Winkelpleck 1990   ; Huber, Netting, and Paton 1993   ; Monk, Kaye, and Litwin 1984   ; Nathanson and Eggleton 1993   ; National Association of State Units on Aging 1993   ; Nelson 1995   ; Nelson, Huber, and Walter 1995   ; Nelson, Pratt, Carpenter, and Walter 1995   ; Office of the Inspector General 1993   ; Schiman and Lordeman 1989a   , Schiman and Lordeman 1989b   ).Less than a decade ago, the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program did not have comprehensive reporting systems in every state, even though this was part of its federal mandate. In 1992, Netting, Paton, and Huber found that the Administration on Aging (AoA) received dissimilar reports from the states and that a standardized complaint reporting form was only recommended. In the early 1990s, hand-tabulated data, inconsistent coding, and the impossibility of developing a meaningful report to Congress led researchers and policymakers to push for a more viable reporting system for the program (Kautz, 1990; Kusserow 1991a   ; Netting et al. 1992   ; Testimony of E. Chelimsky, 1991). These pleas for accountability were reinforced by the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) study of the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program (Harris-Wehling, Feasley, and Estes 1995   ).In 1994 AoA awarded a 2-year grant to our research team to begin working with five pilot states to develop OmTrak, software for the ombudsman program. Since 1996 this and other initiatives have led to tremendous change in the development of computerized ombudsman databases in various states (Huber, Borders, Netting, and Kautz 1997   ). Among the changes was a new reporting form containing 133 types of complaints (the National Ombudsman Reporting System, or NORS). Now more comprehensive and meaningful reports are being released by AoA, in which aggregated statistics across states provide an overview of ombudsman program activities nationally (Administration of Aging [AoA], 1999). Despite this progress, caution must still be taken in interpreting data within and across states (Huber, Borders, Netting, and Kautz 2000   ).Although the new form did not include residents' demographics, six states that had joined the OmTrak effort to computerize their data using the same software agreed to collect residents' gender and race. Researchers working with these states argued that the gender and race of these older persons should be known, even though these data were not required by AoA. Persons responsible for the form's development held that demographic statistics about long-term care residents are readily available and that their collection would be redundant. Researchers replied that existing statistics would not reveal which residents were using ombudsman services and whether there were differences in the types of complaints reported by gender and race.In this article, we report data from six states that used OmTrak to track data. We focus on the relationship between types of complaints, especially abuse, and race and gender to illustrate that collecting basic demographic data can provide important information about events in the nation's long-term care facilities. Elderly Persons at Risk for Abuse Physical abuse is a serious complaint. Yet, for various reasons little is known about elder abuse in long-term care settings. Data are often incomplete and collected in different ways (Baron and Welty 1996   ). No national statistics exist on abuse in long-term care. The result is that elder abuse is more than likely underreported (Kusserow 1991b   ). Despite Pillemer and Finkelhor 1988    finding that neither race nor gender is a significant predictor of abuse in long-term care, a small but growing body of evidence calls into question the so-called leveling hypothesis, which holds that old age distributes inequity and vulnerability more equally among the races and genders than is the case in youth and middle age. Instead, previous research seems to support the rival double-jeopardy hypothesis—that old age exacerbates the harms of social inequality, so that racial minorities, and perhaps women, face greater adversity in their advanced age than do Caucasians and men (McPherson 1983   ).That gender- and race-related problems surface in long-term care is suggested in a scarce but provocative literature. Evidence suggests that minority racial status is a risk factor for long-stay facility access problems (Falcone and Broyles 1994   ), increased rates of accidental injury (Weinberg 1998   ), and placement in troubled, impoverished facilities (Kosberg 1973   ) that are further away from home settings than is the case for Caucasians (Kosberg and Tobin 1972   ). Gender is also problematic, but the data are harder to interpret. For example, it has recently been suggested that men in nursing homes may receive better care and more staff attention than women (Claridge, Rowell, Duffy, and Duffy 1995   ) and that women are more vulnerable to sexual and physical abuse than men (Kosberg and Nahmiash 1996   ). There is also evidence that women are subjected to more extreme forms of abuse than men (Pillemer and Finkelhor 1988   ). Griffin and Aitken 1999    maintained that institutional abuse is routine and is overwhelmingly perpetrated by poor women against old women. They concluded that institutional abuse remains hidden because this very non-nurturing, nonfeminine pattern runs contrary to culturally based gender expectations. As such, it is profoundly underreported and underinvestigated. Payne and Cikovic 1995   , on the other hand, found that men were more likely to be victims of abuse than women. This is consistent with other analysts writing about elder abuse, but drawing conclusions relevant to institutional settings, who argued that men may be more susceptible to physical abuse than women because men are more likely to exhibit combative behaviors (Tatara, cited in Kosberg and Nahmiash 1996   ) and may be excluded from "screening protocols" (Kosberg and Nahmiash 1996   , p. 34). Regardless, physical abuse seems to be widespread. Pillemer and Moore 1989   (pp. 315–316) found that 36% of the 577 nursing home staff they interviewed reported seeing at least one incident of physical abuse, and 81% had seen at least one incident of psychological abuse over the last year. Ten percent of those surveyed had themselves committed acts of physical abuse, and 40% admitted to committing an act of psychological abuse (Pillemer and Moore 1989   , p. 317).Given this history of sketchy evidence of abuse that occurs in nursing homes, we determined that an examination of types of complaints by race and gender could contribute to the literature in two ways: (a) to demonstrate the utility of knowing the race and gender of nursing home residents and (b) to learn whether abuse and neglect are among the five most frequently reported complaints that were investigated by ombudsmen.Ombudsmen receive complaints before they are referred to the criminal justice system. The very nature of their work puts them in local long-term care facilities on an ongoing basis, as potential troubleshooters and as advocates for vulnerable older residents. The data reported in this article reveal that race may put residents at greater risk of abuse, regardless of gender. Methods By October 1996, the standardized NORS had been developed in collaboration with state and local ombudsmen. The 133 complaint categories were placed under five general headings: (a) resident rights, (b) resident care, (c) quality of life, (d) administration, and (e) problems not related to the facilities in which residents live (i.e., other agencies, systems, or people). Some definitions may be helpful in understanding the current discussion. Definitions Abuse. The willful (a) infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or cruel punishment with resulting physical harm, pain, or mental anguish or (b) deprivation by a person, including a caregiver, of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness (Administration of Aging [AoA], 1998, p. 13). Complaint. A problem brought to the attention of the ombudsman for investigation and action. Complaints may be lodged by (or on behalf of) one or more residents of a long-term care facility. One or more complaints—from cold coffee to physical or sexual abuse—constitute a case (AoA, 1998, p. 1). Origins of Complaints. Long-term care ombudsmen identify, investigate, and work to resolve complaints that come to their attention in a number of ways. First, residents of long-term care facilities (usually nursing homes) tell ombudsmen about problems they are experiencing when ombudsmen visit their facilities. These complaints can be said to be lodged by the residents themselves. Second, other people may call the ombudsman and file a complaint. Such complaints are said to be lodged on behalf of residents. Third, in most states, ombudsmen routinely visit nursing homes at varying times to observe the facilities and the nature of the care being provided. These complaints are then lodged by the ombudsmen themselves. Exactly when ombudsmen visit facilities varies among states and even among local programs within a state. Ombudsmen may visit on a fairly routine schedule unless they begin to hear reports of, for example, neglect on the night shift. They may then make an unannounced visit during that shift to gain a different perspective. Most states do not dictate when facility visits should occur. An Oregon Administrative Rule, for example, states that "the ombudsman or designee may obtain access to a long term care facility at any time considered necessary and reasonable by the ombudsman or designee for the purpose of performing the duties of the ombudsman or designee" (Oregon Administrative Rule 114, 1989). Other ombudsman programs even make it their policy not to establish predictable visiting routines. Verified Complaints. After investigation (e.g., phone calls, visits) the complaint is determined to be generally true or accurate. This verification, in most states, is not held to a legal standard such as "beyond reasonable doubt." Disposition. Each complaint is assigned a disposition code when the case is closed. 1 = resolution required legal or legislative action that the ombudsman was unable to provide; 2 = not resolved; 3 = the complaint was referred to another agency, (e.g., the health department), but no action was taken; 4 = the complaint was referred to another agency and no response was received; 5 = no action needed/appropriate; 6 = partially resolved; and 7 = the complaint was fully resolved.It is important to stress that ombudsman complaint data are not duplicated by any other governmental body, except perhaps for the small percentage of the complaints that are referred to regulators for investigation or punitive action. However, even in states where ombudsmen are mandated to report abuse, this number is reported to be less than 20% (Nelson et al. 1995   ), which includes all referrals, not just governmental. Consequently, it can be safely assumed that up to 85% or more of all ombudsman complaints are not recorded elsewhere.Moreover, although exact numbers are not available, a large percentage of ombudsman complaints arise from a process of routine visits, often during odd hours and weekends when other government agents are rarely seen. It is fair to say, then, that ombudsman data may represent a more accurate picture of routine problems and issues in long-stay institutions than the annual snapshots, for example, that make up the state health department surveys, which constitute the only other major source of problem identification available to the public. Data Analyzed in This Study Six state ombudsmen using OmTrak agreed that we could analyze their 1996 data as long as state names were not revealed, given the highly political climate in which these programs operate. Although we realize that readers might be interested in knowing the states used, our purpose in this article is to demonstrate the value of collecting resident demographics, not to compare data across states.Data from these six states were sent to us on computer disks. Considerable data cleaning was required before all six databases were ready for merging into a single Statistical Package for the Social Sciences file for analysis. The names of residents had been removed before data were sent to us, and we also removed the names of individual facilities. Data entry errors were corrected if the information was available and eliminated from current analyses if not.OmTrak is a relational database, which means that data can be collected on two different levels: case and the specific complaints within the case. On the case level, information is obtained about the resident and complainant. On the complaint level, one complainant may lodge several complaints relative to one case. In this article we are concerned with these two levels of data: (a) case specific and (b) complaint specific.These data manipulations completed, we began data analyses to answer the question: What are the relationships between race and gender, and types of complaints lodged, verified, and fully resolved (for residents of long-term care facilities in six states using NORS)? The findings we discuss later show why it is important to collect these resident characteristics. Results For the six states reported here, there were 23,787 complaints across the 133 complaint types on the AoA required reporting form. Of these 23,787 complaints, 19,617 (82%) contained data on residents' gender and 17,008 (72%) contained race information, yielding about the same percentage (71%, 16,945) that contained both resident gender and race data ( Fig. 1 ). For the purposes of this article we have further recoded race into two categories: Caucasians and minorities, although African Americans constituted about 78% of all minorities represented in the database. The Five Most Frequently Reported Complaints Because the residents' race was collected in the majority of cases in these six states, it was possible to isolate the complaints in those cases and focus on particular types of complaints that were lodged on behalf of racial minority groups. For example,  Table 1  shows the five most frequently reported complaints lodged by, or on behalf of, each of the four groups of residents by race and gender: Caucasian men, Caucasian women, minority men, and minority women, as well as for those for whom we had no race or gender data ( Table 1  , Six complaints are shown for minority women due to a tie).Examination of  Table 1  tells several stories. First, the types of complaints in the last column on the right (Race and Gender Not Known) were markedly different than the other four groups for whom race and gender were known. This shows the degree to which critical information was masked when race and gender data were not available for analysis. For example, unknown would be the fact that physical abuse appeared in the five most frequently reported complaints for all four racial/gender groups. Without these demographics, one could mistakenly construe (from the last column) that the biggest problem was that residents' wandering behaviors were not adequately monitored, and the more critical problems represented in  Table 1  by race and gender would have remained hidden.Second, the five most frequently lodged complaints were the same for both Caucasian men and women, albeit in different rank order. Nearly equal percentages of the complaints for minority men, however (about 25%), pertained to physical abuse and loss of dignity and respect. Further examination of the column for minority men also shows that gross neglect (20%) and appeared in their five most frequently reported complaints but did not appear in the top five for minority women or Caucasians. A connection between staff being unresponsive (16%) and gross neglect (20% for minority men) and 15% each of staff unresponsive and unattended symptoms for minority women is not hard to make ( Table 1  ).Third, the second highest percentage of the five most frequently reported complaints lodged for minority women pertained to physical abuse (16%,  Table 1  ), which was about the same percentage as for Caucasian women. Wandering (16%) also appeared among the six (due to the tie) most frequently reported complaints for minority women, but for none of the other groups. One can imagine a common theme in the five types of complaints that appeared for minority men (gross neglect and staff unresponsive) and minority women (staff unresponsive, symptoms unattended, and wandering) that did not appear in the five most frequent complaints for either Caucasian men or women: one of inattention to minority residents ( Table 1  ).Lastly, loss of dignity/respect, accidents, and physical abuse were found in the five most frequently reported complaints lodged for all four groups of elderly persons ( Table 1  ). Certainly the data from this study raise additional questions about gender and race that have not hitherto been addressed. Verification and Disposition of Complaints by Race and Gender There were additional differences by race and gender. After complaints are lodged ombudsmen investigate circumstances to verify the complaints (or not). Of all complaints lodged on behalf of residents (for whom race and gender data were available), higher percentages of complaints for minorities were verified ( Fig. 2 ). Conversely, even though significantly higher percentages of complaints lodged for minorities were verified, significantly lower percentages of those verified complaints were fully resolved for minorities ( Fig. 3 ).Also included in  Fig. 2  and  Fig. 3  are the percentages of complaints verified and fully resolved for the complaints for which no resident characteristics were available. In  Fig. 2 , 74% of complaints for which no race and gender data were available were verified, comparable to the verification percentages for Caucasian men and women (75% and 73%, respectively). In  Fig. 3 , the percentage of verified complaints for which race and gender were not known that were fully resolved (47%) was closer to the verification percentages of Caucasian men and women than it was to those of minority men and women. (The sample size of 5,964 is smaller than the sample size in  Fig. 2  because more verification data were recorded than disposition in many of the same cases where no race or gender data were reported.)It is somewhat troubling that although higher percentages of complaints lodged on behalf of minorities were verified, lower percentages of those verified complaints were fully resolved to the satisfaction of the residents. Even complaints for which race and gender were not available resulted in a higher percentage fully resolved than complaints for minority residents. Future research should examine these phenomena to discern whether there is some form of racial or gender discrimination at play in these areas. Huber and colleagues 2000    made the point that it is vitally important to have a working analyst-practitioner link when analysts are attempting to understand what data mean. States report data differently for different reasons: state ombudsmen's philosophies, state statutes, political climate, and so forth. Even though the emphasis in this article is on the benefits of reporting demographic information, the point must be made that data must be interpreted with great care. Discussion The mandated ombudsman reporting form does not require the collection of resident demographics. We contend that this information is important in assessing what happens to different racial and gender groups in long-term care facilities. This concern is discussed in this section in terms of practice and policy implications, determining whether to collect race and gender data, and in conclusion, whose responsibility it is to collect demographic data. Practice Implications What can an ombudsman do with these data to improve services? Having demographic data enables local and state ombudsmen to not only react to complaints, but also to watch for known patterns and trends from the data to prevent further maltreatment of residents in long-term care facilities. For example, if the local ombudsman knows that minority men, as a group, are most likely to be neglected, the ombudsman can watch for early signs and preventive measures can be taken. Similarly, if local data indicate that minority women are at higher risk for having their symptoms go unattended, perhaps even in a certain facility, prevention measures can bring symptoms to the attention of the facility staff and administration before they escalate into dangerous stages, for example, bed sores. Analyses of types of complaint by demographic information can add the advantage of known indicators of maltreatment in time to prevent it.In keeping with the ombudsman program's community education mandate, local programs might develop culturally/racially sensitive materials to help identify special minority risk factors and to encourage abuse reporting among groups who are fearful of retaliation or skeptical of government reporting. Moreover, because racial differences between staff and patients may be linked to less demonstrative interactions (Kahana, Kahana, and Young 1985   ) and are no doubt the cause of some "personality conflicts," which are, in turn, linked to "abuse interactions" (Kosberg and Nahmiash 1996   , p. 32), ombudsman programs in communities with strong minority or immigrant presence might benefit from diversity/sensitivity training. Policy Implications As it stands now, both the general public and policymakers have a poor grasp of the influence of race and gender on the quality of life and care in the various long-stay settings. Any coordinated effort to identify and assess protective needs and objectives on the basis of race and gender is now virtually impossible. Consequently, we make the following recommendations. First, the Assistant Secretary for Aging should publish guidance documents encouraging states with large minority populations to collect race data for purposes of educational advocacy. Second, the Assistant Secretary should direct all states to assess the feasibility of collecting race-based data by the end of this decade in anticipation of important demographic shifts. Third, the Assistant Secretary should require all states to collect gender data. Fourth, the Assistant Secretary should take steps to support gender- and race-based research. Determining Whether to Collect Data on Race and Gender Among the six states that were willing to collect data on race and gender, there are still many complaints about which the gender and race of the older resident are not known. It is not surprising that gender is missing less often than race, given that gender is more easily discerned when complaints are received. Residents' names or pronouns used (he or she) by the complainant often indicate gender. Race, on the other hand, requires an ombudsman to inquire or see the resident, and there is the potential for an inaccurate response given that the person lodging the complaint may not be correct about a resident's race. We do not contend that tracking race is easy, but we are suggesting that knowing race is valuable in determining social injustices that may disproportionately impact elderly people in minority groups.Some ombudsmen have argued that collecting racial data in states with smaller numbers of minorities is not helpful because there are so few persons served. Certainly arguments that racial minorities make up a small percentage of the nation's nursing homes can be used to minimize the importance of examining race as a data element. Moreover, it is true that some states have so little racial diversity within their long-term care systems that requiring the collection of this variable would currently render very few situations in which long-term care residents are not Caucasian, although gender would certainly be important. However, to rely on this argument as a reason for not collecting racial data is shortsighted at best. The near-future America will have a different racial hue. Non-Hispanic Caucasians will become just another minority exceeded in number by other racial groups that will make up America's fast-evolving racial mosaic.Can policymakers rationally ignore race in developing protocols and programs for tomorrow's increasingly burdened long-term care system? At the very least, it would seem that, even now, in states serving larger numbers of racially diverse elderly persons the unit responsible for overseeing the ombudsman program at the state level would want to have these data collected. At this point, few states collect information on gender or race, regardless of whom they serve or the racial diversity of their populations.On the other hand, in states serving large numbers of racially diverse clients, not collecting these data could actually mask the fact that serious complaints such as physical abuse are more likely to occur for racial minority elderly persons, particularly men. If ombudsmen are to perform advocacy roles, it would seem imperative that they know when certain groups of elderly persons are disproportionate targets for complaints such as physical abuse and gross neglect.The ombudsman reporting system has the potential to identify specific facilities in which large numbers of complaints are being filed. Without demographic data to reveal resident characteristics, it is not possible to identify those facilities that may be particularly insensitive to persons of different races and gender. The data presented in this article reveal that different types of complaints may be associated with different subgroups of elderly persons. They also indicate that fully resolving complaints for some groups may be more difficult than for others. Knowing this information would allow a state ombudsman to target certain types of complaints for careful study, to determine why these discrepancies exist. However, if these data are not collected, there is no way to document what is happening. Reliance on anecdotal data is not enough to effect change. Conclusion: Whose Responsibility Is It to Collect These Data? In the last 5 years tremendous progress has been made in the development of NORS. As recently as 1994, it was not possible to conduct cross-state analyses of complaint data. AoA aggregated data from states willing to participate and reported the results to Congress. Today, AoA requires only aggregated data from states, but data are more reliable, standard reporting forms are used, and individual states have the capacity to analyze their respective databases.We do not contend that AoA should begin asking for raw data and become analysts of a national ombudsman database. With decentralization and the diversity among states, creation of a national database may not be feasible. Even if AoA were to ask for raw data, it lacks sufficient staff and interest to fully analyze data across states. This has never been AoA's intent and it is not likely to change now. We do believe, however, that AoA is responsible for raising consciousness, for providing a broad vision of the issues, and for advocating for increasingly diverse cohorts of older Americans. AoA is in a leadership position to amplify state and regional analyses that need to be brought to national attention. At a minimum, AoA could raise the consciousness of state leaders so that ombudsmen in states serving large numbers of racial minority residents in long-term care would be aware of the importance of knowing how these residents fare in comparison with their Caucasian counterparts. Similarly, it would be important to know what happens to women and men, whether they are treated differently, and to what problems they might be particularly susceptible. If gender and race are indeed tied to particular complaint types, ombudsmen need to be vigilant in monitoring what happens to older residents.For researchers interested in older persons, ombudsman state-level databases represent a rich resource for analysis. The role of the academy is to work with state and local ombudsmen to conduct data analyses that AoA cannot (and is not expected to) do. For example, researchers can team with state ombudsmen to clean raw data, which can explain small discrepancies in data sent to AoA. Researchers and ombudsmen can work together to allow states to review statewide trends and then compare differences across substate regions, including other variables (such as gender and race) that are not required by AoA but that are important to understanding diversity within a particular state. Researchers and ombudsmen can share data with one another to see if there are trends within the state, the region, or even within local facilities, for example, on what shifts abuse is occurring. These trends could be shared with other state agencies that are attempting to find reliable data on the events in the lives of older residents in long-term care facilities, particularly with an eye to gender and racial sensitivity.

We have learned, however, that program officials have decided to keep the original term as it came from Sweden. Our goal is to strengthen the program—not to offend ombudsmen—so we acquiesce to their preference of terms.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined the unique contribution of key existential factors to the prediction of psychological well-being of older adults following spousal loss. Design and Method: A number of measures to assess psychological well-being, sociodemographic standing, social resources, and religious and spiritual resources were administered to a volunteer sample of widows and widowers to test the hypothesis that existential factors such as personal meaning, religiosity, and spirituality are more potent predictors of psychological well-being than are previously hypothesized variables of sociodemographic, social support, and physical factors. Results: A hierarchical regression analysis of the data supported the hypothesis that existential factors are major contributors to psychological well-being of older adults following spousal loss. Findings showed that widowers, compared to widows, scored lower on the measure of psychological well-being. Implications: Implications of the findings are discussed for practitioners working with bereaved spouses; suggestions for further research concerning bereavement and psychological well-being are made.   Spousal loss ,  Psychological well-being ,  Personal meaning ,  Religiosity ,  Spirituality Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDSpousal loss in late life is widely accepted as being a stressful experience, accompanied by changes in individuals' perceptions of their overall psychosocial functioning and mental outlook (Caserta, Lund, and Rice 1999   ; Fry 1998   ). The death of a spouse can, in fact, permeate all aspects of the surviving spouse's present and future functioning and be severely disruptive to psychological health and balance (Campbell and Silverman 1999   ; Gallagher-Thompson, Futterman, Faberow, Thompson, & Peterson, 1993; Morgan 1994   ). Although some recent longitudinal studies (e.g., Fry 1998   ; McCrae and Costa 1993   ; Wortman and Silver 1990   ) document evidence of considerable psychological resilience among widows and widowers and show positive gains and growth in psychosocial functioning in postbereavement years, the bulk of previous research studies (e.g., Gallagher-Thompson et al. 1993   ; Mendes de Leon, Kasl, and Jacobs 1994   ; Middleton, Raphael, Martinek, and Misso 1993   ; Raphael, Middleton, Martinek, and Misso 1993   ) has documented the negative sequelae associated with the death of the spouse and its serious debilitating effects on the widowed individuals' resilience and capacity to recover from adverse physical and mental health effects of grief and bereavement (Gallagher-Thompson et al. 1993   ). Most cross-sectional studies of widowed individuals (e.g., Osterweis, Solomon, and Green 1984   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ) note that following spousal loss, psychological health and well-being of individuals declines considerably, especially in terms of increased depression and anxiety, absence of happy affect, and decline in self-esteem, autonomy, and control (Lund, Caserta, Dimond, and Shaffer 1989   ).The psychosocial model of mental health counseling (see Raphael et al. 1993   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ; Stroebe and Stroebe 1987   ) posits that decline in psychosocial functioning following spousal loss arises from loss of meaningful spousal roles and functions, loss of significant relationships, social support, contacts, and frequently diminished income following the death of the spouse. Following spousal loss, so much emotional energy is depleted in dealing with the stress of the loss that little energy remains for productive "grief work" (Worden 1991   ). In an attempt to teach surviving spouses how to cope with loneliness and distress, counselors have frequently used the stress/coping paradigm of grief therapy in which the focus has been on (a) exploring with clients the stress in their daily lives and their financial strains; (b) reappraising cognitively their negative life events; and (c) learning adaptive coping mechanisms for dealing with loss of social and economic resources and with physical health problems (see discussions by Moos and Schaefer 1986   ; Raphael et al. 1993   ; Stroebe and Stroebe 1987   ). For researchers, the psychosocial stress model of well-being suggests that stressors arising from the loss of highly valued roles and secondary strains, compromise well-being of bereaved spouses. A number of studies have therefore looked at the stress-buffering effects of social support as a stress-mediating factor in psychological well-being of bereaved spouses (see Litwin 1999   ). Although much has been learned from the existing literature about the determinants and predictors of psychological well-being within a stress/coping paradigm, we have little understanding of existential factors that help some widows and widowers to transcend their grief and to cope successfully with the transition to widow(er)hood (Worden 1991   ).More recently, researchers have begun to appreciate the usefulness of an existential paradigm for understanding the dynamics of the effects of spousal loss on the psychological well-being of surviving spouses. Thus, within the context of an existential paradigm or framework, the focus is on the uniqueness of the human experience of suffering and loss as expressed phenomenologically. Raphael and colleagues 1993    reported a loss of purpose for living. Dershimer 1989    discussed the intensity of existential confusion and incoherence immediately after the loss. The existential framework of mental health posits that humans are not merely biological, social, or emotional beings, but beings able to rise above their stresses to achieve a higher level of existential awareness (Farran 1997   ). Recently, many psychologists and practitioners (e.g., Cole and Pargament 1999   ; Miller 1999   ; St. John 1999   ; Thorson 1999   ; Tonigan, Toscova, and Connors 1999   ) have made a strong appeal for considering grief and bereavement within the context of an existential paradigm. Several of these authors argue that the dynamics of spousal loss can best be understood or captured within an existential framework concerned with assessing the extent to which "ultimate concerns" of human beings' existence such as isolation, meaninglessness, loss of hope, choice, and meaning for life (Frankl 1984   ; Yalom 1980   ) contribute to the prediction of psychological well-being among elderly widows and widowers. As applied to the mental health and psychological well-being of widows and widowers, our understanding of their distress, depression, or grief may be more enhanced or enriched in a context that takes into account the existential needs or life concerns of the respondents. This is not to deny the significance of the role that demographic factors such as age, income, and gender play in coping with the stress of spousal loss, or to underestimate the important contribution that social resources, negative events, or physical health make toward psychological well-being (see Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ; Stroebe and Stroebe 1983   ).In keeping with this line of thinking, the purpose of this study was to examine the unique and combined contribution of several existential variables (meaning for life, optimism, choice, religious involvement, and spirituality), traditional measures of social resources, negative life events, and physical health, and demographic factors (sex, age, income, education) in predicting psychological well-being in a community-residing sample of recently bereaved widows and widowers. Psychological Well-Being: The Construct and Components According to a number of gerontologists and epidemiologists (see discussions by Chatters 1988   ; Ellison 1994   ; Koenig et al. 1997   ; Levin and Chatters 1998   ; Okun 1995   ), psychological well-being is an umbrella construct of psychological health constituting an amalgam of various affective, experiential, and cognitive components that act and interact with one another in complex ways and are influenced, in turn, both directly and indirectly, by other variables of health, positive outlook, and social and emotional resources. Interactions of these variables may contribute significantly to psychological well-being. As used in this study, the construct is multifaceted and refers to a combination of various psychological dimensions, including components of morbidity, anxiety, mood, self-esteem, emotional adjustment, and autonomy. This conceptualization of psychological well-being is consistent with ones advanced by a number of earlier researchers (e.g., Ainlay and Smith 1984   ; Bradburn 1969   ; Holohan 1988   ; Miller 1976   ; Ryff 1995   ). More recently, gerontologists concerned with predicting successful aging also agree that psychological states of morbidity, anxiety, self-esteem, and autonomy are more valid indicators of subjective well-being in later life (see discussion by Holohan and Sears 1995   ; Levin and Chatters 1998   ) than previously included indices of self-mastery and environmental mastery. Levin and Tobin 1995   , in their review, noted that in bereavement and widowhood studies, negative change in psychological well-being was most in evidence on dimensions of happy affect, self-esteem, emotional adjustment, and autonomy.There is an increasing acceptance in the broader psychological literature of the notion that indices of affect, mood, self-esteem, and autonomy contribute significantly to well-being in individuals past age 75 (American Psychological Association 1993   ) in both advantaged and disadvantaged circumstances. Also, there is a paucity of information on any one or more standardized measures of psychological well-being that are reliable and valid for use with individuals who are both old, frail, and disadvantaged (American Psychological Association 1993   ). Thus, for purposes of this study we developed a measure of well-being that included primary psychological dimensions of mood, affect, self-esteem, and autonomy alongside other sociodemographic indicators of psychological well-being that have been used in previous studies of bereavement and widowhood (e.g., Osterweis, Solomon, and Green 1984   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ).The present study was predicated on the assumption that existential factors such as meaning for life, purpose, choice, optimism, and spiritual and religious involvement are more powerful predictors of well-being following spousal loss than previously postulated factors of demographics and stressors such as loss of social resources, physical health, and negative events. These assumptions are in line with the thinking of some bereavement theorists (e.g., Cassem 1975   ; Jaffe 1985   ; Moustakas 1977   ; Schneider 1989   ), who contend that personal meaning, defined as having a purpose in life, gives the surviving spouse a sense of order and a reason for existence. With regard to mental health, dispositional optimism and the degree to which the individual perceives having personal agency (choice/responsibleness) have been shown to be related to a number of measures of psychological and physical well-being (see Reker, Peacock, and Wong 1987   ; Zika and Chamberlain 1992   ). Thus, optimism and choice, as positive attitudinal factors contributing to self-esteem, life satisfaction, and personal growth in the face of losses and distress, are postulated to be important variables in understanding the mental health and psychological well-being of grieving widow(er)s. In a variety of life spheres, religious involvement and spirituality are increasingly recognized to be a solid basis for providing faith, hope, and psychological well-being even in the face of horrendous external conditions over which an individual may have no control (Koenig and Futterman 1994   ; Levin 1995   ; Maton and Wells 1995   ). Thus, it seems reasonable to postulate that, after spousal loss, individuals who perceive their own lives to be meaningful, and who have a clear sense of choice and a positive religious and spiritual outlook on life, will be less vulnerable to the debilitating effects of grief and coping with the loneliness, self-doubts, and uncertainty that generally accompany bereavement.The major goal of this study was to investigate, in depth, the possibility alluded to by existential and humanistic theorists (e.g., Conant 1996   ; Maslow 1955   ; Wortman and Silver 1990   ) that following major loss, existential variables of meaningfulness, optimism, and spirituality/religiosity may play an even greater role in the maintenance of stable psychological well-being than previously recognized demographic factors or social support factors. It is important to note that while the influence of traditional variables such as social support, physical health, and negative life events have been examined in a few previous studies of elderly persons (e.g., Heaney and Israel 1997   ; Krause 1986   , Krause 1987   ; Krause and Borowski-Clark 1994   ), investigations of the unique contribution of existential variables to psychological well-being have rarely been considered in the context of bereavement. Substantive issues, such as the quality of one's inner life, meaning for life, spiritual development, and religious involvement have not, until recently, been conceived as salient influences on the well-being of older adults who experienced diverse losses (McFadden 1996   ). Hypotheses Following findings from a number of previous studies that have proposed links between existential factors and life satisfactions in old age, two major hypotheses were proposed:First, based on earlier findings providing suggestive indications of the salutory influence of religion and spirituality in the lives of distressed individuals (Ainlay, Singleton, and Swigert 1992   ; Idler and Kasl 1992   ; Pressman, Lyons, Larson, and Strain 1990   ), it was proposed that existential dimensions would be more potent predictors of the psychological well-being of bereaved spouses than would be the demographic and traditional variables of social support, negative events, and physical health. Second, it was proposed that existential variables such as personal meaning, religious involvement, spirituality, optimism, and choice would contribute more significantly to the prediction of psychological well-being of widows compared to their counterparts, the widowers. The latter hypothesis is predicated on previous research suggesting greater social isolation among the bereaved widowers and more limited psychological resources available to them (Campbell and Silverman 1999   ; Davidson, Feldman, and Crawford 1994   ; Lieberman 1996   ; Murrell and Himmelfarb 1989   ). Methods Participants and Recruitment Procedures Participants in the study were 101 widows and 87 widowers aged 65 to 87 years who volunteered to be involved in a study of factors related to adjustment after spousal loss. The data were collected as part of a larger community-based study of social network supports for recently bereaved older adults (see Fry 1998   ). Community-residing widows and widowers were recruited through local community newsletters and posters circulated in social service agencies, and by word of mouth, in three mid-sized cities in Southern Alberta. The help of family members, caregivers, and pastoral and chaplains' staff was also solicited to encourage the participation of bereaved spouses. As an incentive to participate, individuals who were receptive to an initial phone call were invited to participate in two didactic group sessions of bereavement counseling headed by a professional counselor.Eligibility criteria included spousal loss within the previous 24 months, but not more recently than the last 6 months. For ethical considerations, it was decided not to include persons whose loss had occurred more recently than 6 months previous (see discussion by Parkes 1995   ). Other eligibility criteria were that the participants must be English-speaking, residing in the community (i.e., not in an institution, hospital, or nursing home), and not having physical or cognitive impairments that would preclude taking paper-and-pencil tests. The final sample was a representative cross-section of various sociodemographic communities. Sociodemographic information on the samples of widows and widowers is presented in  Table 1  . Measures Psychological Well-Being. Following Ainlay and Smith 1984   , Bradburn 1969   , Holohan 1988   , Miller 1976   , and Ryff 1995   , a composite measure of psychological well-being was developed as follows: (a) Depressed mood was assessed on a 9-point scale (reverse scored with a higher score reflecting less depression), with the extremes labeled depressed (score = 1) and cheerful (score = 9). (b) Anxious mood was assessed on a 9-point scale (reverse scored with a higher score reflecting less anxiety), with the extremes labeled anxiety (score = 1) and calmness (score = 9). (c) Happy mood was assessed on a 9-point scale (reverse scored with a higher score reflecting more happiness), with the extremes labeled very unhappy (score = 1) to very happy (score = 9). In rating their depressive, anxious, and happy moods, participants were asked to report their mood during the last four months or so. (d) Autonomy was measured by means of a 5-item subscale of autonomy adapted from Ryff 1989    measure of psychological well-being (reverse scored with a higher score reflecting high autonomy). After reversing some items, scores on this measure can range from 1 to 25. (e) Self-esteem was assessed on a 9-point rating of self-esteem scale items (Rosenberg 1965   ; reverse scored with a higher score reflecting high self-esteem). (f) Adaptation to widowhood was measured using a five-item Ease of Role Transition Scale (ERTS) adapted from Miller 1976   . The objective was to get the respondent to give a summary self-assessment of whether the adaptation to widowhood had been extremely difficult (score = 1) or relatively easy (score = 5). Items were reverse scored with a lower score denoting greater difficulty in adaptation. Scores on this submeasure of psychological well-being can range between 5 and 25, with a high score denoting greater ease of transition to widow(er) role. Miller 1976    reported an alpha reliability of .75 for this submeasure of psychological well-being, and noted that he had no problems using this scale with older adults. Alpha coefficients were .79 and .84 for widows and widowers, respectively.Scores on the three mood items (depression, anxiety, unhappiness), the Self-esteem items, Autonomy items, and the Ease of Role Transition were then summed to form a composite measure of psychological well-being, with a higher score reflecting more positive well-being. Alpha coefficients for the composite measure were .74 and .82 for widows and widowers, respectively, demonstrating high levels of internal consistency for all measures. Social Support and Access to Social Resources. These were measured by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, and Farley 1988   ). This scale has been used with different populations and age groups, and with both clinical and nonclinical samples in studies of depression, suicide, and such. Zimet and colleagues reported excellent psychometric properties, reliability, and validity with different populations, especially considering the limited number of items in the scale. Internal reliability (alpha coefficient) was .88 and test–retest reliability was .85 for the total scale. Construct validity was established by an inverse correlation with depression and anxiety scores (r = –.25). Three sources of support were measured through three subscales (Family, Friends, and Significant Others) with a composite higher score corresponding to higher support from the three sources. Cronbach's coefficients were between .89 and .93 for the factors of Friends, Family, and Significant Others. Alpha coefficients were .69 to .75 for widows and widowers, respectively. Physical Health Problems. These were measured by a 26-item physical health checklist of illnesses (OARS; Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ) most commonly encountered by elderly persons. Participants responded Yes/No to the question, "Do you have any of the following illnesses at the present time?" A high score of Yes responses reflects a large number of physical health problems. Alpha coefficients were .62 and .72 for widows and widowers, respectively. Frequency of Negative Events. This was measured by means of one question: How frequently do you encounter negative life events (i.e., events that upset you, cause you to become angry with yourself or others, or events that make you sad and depressed)? Choices were: on a daily basis (6) to rarely (1). Personal Meaning. This was measured by a composite index of the Life Purpose (life goals, mission in life, sense of direction), Will to Meaning (sense of order, reason for existence, clear sense of identity), and Future Meaning (future potentialities, fulfillment, and positive expectations concerning one's future life) subscales of the Life Attitude Profile (LAP; Reker and Peacock 1981   ). The subscales of the LAP were reported by its authors as having significant positive correlations with measures of both psychological and physical well-being of older adults. Also, high alpha coefficients demonstrated the internal consistency among the subscales (Reker et al. 1987   ). Scores for each subscale (7-point) are expressed as a mean and summed across subscales. Scores can range from 3 to 21. Alpha coefficients were .83 and .79 for the widows and widowers, respectively. Measure of Religious Involvement. In order to measure respondents' extent of participation in formally organized religious activity, a five-item index of organizational religiosity was adapted from Chatters, Levin, and Taylor 1992   . Item 1 measured: Taking all things into account, how important is religion to you in your daily life? (from very much = 6 to not at all = 1). Item 2 measured frequency of attendance at church, synagogue, or other formal places of worship: How frequently do you attend religious services or religious activities? (from daily = 6 to never = 1). Item 3 measured intensity of religious involvement in church, synagogue membership, and related activity from deeply involved = 6 to marginally involved = 1. Item 4 measured respondents' involvement in diverse forms of informal religious activity: How frequently do you participate in informal religious services, for example, listen to or watch religious talk shows on TV and radio, sing hymns or church music, or read the Bible? (from daily = 6 to seldom = 1). Item 5 measured respondents' degree of comfort derived from religion in times of suffering and distress (from very much = 6 to none at all = 1). A higher score denotes a high degree of comfort from religion and religious participation. Measure of Accessibility to Religious Support Services. This measure had one question: How easy or difficult is it to get the help of your pastor, minister, religious mentor, or church and synagogue members in a time of need? The choices were very easy = 6 to very difficult = 1. Index of Spirituality. Spirituality was assessed with Howden 1992    Spirituality Assessment Scale (SAS), which is a 28-item Likert-type scale covering four significant domains, including Purpose for Life, Inner Resources, Inner-connectedness, and Transcendence. The scale is concerned with assessing related constructs of personal contemplation, private prayer, and connectedness with self and a power higher than oneself. Howden reported inter-item consistency to be .92 for the total SAS. Significant reliability coefficients for the scale were reported also by Brennan 1999   , who used the scale with older adults. In the current sample, reliabilities for the four domain subscales ranged from .69 to .81, and inter-item consistency of this measure was .81 for the total SAS.The scores on the various items measuring organizational religiosity, spirituality, and accessibility to religious support services were summed to form a composite score for each of five indices of religiosity, spirituality, comfort from religion, peace with self, and accessibility to religious support. Higher scores reflected higher religious and spiritual involvement, higher degree of comfort derived from religion, higher degree of peace with self, and easier access to religious support. Alpha coefficients ranging from .71 to .76 and from .77 to .84 were found for the various composite indices of religious involvement, spirituality, and accessibility to religious support for the widows and widowers sample, respectively. Optimism. Optimism was measured by means of Scheier and Carver 1985    Measure of Dispositional Optimism (MDO). This is a 12-item measure rated on a 5-point rating scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Scores may range from 12 to 60. Typical items include "In uncertain times, I usually expect the best"; "I am a believer in the idea that every cloud has a silver lining"; and "I can rarely count on good things happening to me." Scheier and Carver 1992    present extensive reliability and validity data of their optimism measure in various clinical and nonclinical samples, and demonstrate the links between optimism and physical and emotional health and well-being (Scheier and Carver 1985   , Scheier and Carver 1992   ). Alpha coefficients for the dispositional optimism scale were .67 to .71 for widows and widowers, respectively.It should be noted that all measures administered to the participants were formatted in terms of language and structure appropriate for adults having a 9th grade education. All paper-and-pencil tests and self-report measures used in the study were previously piloted on a volunteer group of 20 men and women aged 60 to 80. Subsequent modifications were made in the instructions and illustrations given for responding to the 6-point ratings of test items. This procedure was undertaken to ensure that even those participants who were elderly and had relatively limited education could validly complete the measures. Design and Analysis of the Study A stepwise hierarchical regression analysis model was used in this study, with the expectation that it would provide estimates of the percentage of variance in "psychological well-being" accounted for by the four blocks, respectively, of the sociodemographic variables (i.e., age, education, and income), traditional measures (i.e., social resources, negative life events, and physical health problems), existential measures (personal meaning, participation in organized religion, spiritual involvement, importance of religion, comfort from religion, sense of inner peace, accessibility to religious support, and optimistic outlook), and interactions of health and key existential variables. The regression is stepwise on the four sets or blocks of variables used and is hierarchical on the variables within each step. The regression model used is linear. The same stepwise linear hierarchical regression analysis was performed on the sample of widows and widowers in order to observe differences or similarities between predictors of psychological well-being for the two samples.Independent of whether the differences in the final regression models for the widows' and widowers' samples were salient or trivial, an a priori decision was made to do a similar regression analysis on the combined sample of widows and widowers. The underlying rationale for studying the predictor variables in the combined sample was that the findings regarding predictors of psychological well-being would be generalizable to a heterogenous group of male and female elders who have experienced grief and bereavement.In order to test for the unique, combined, and interactive contribution of the three demographic variables, three traditional variables, and eight existential variables to the prediction of psychological well-being, a four-step multiple hierarchical regression analysis was performed on the data for the sample of elderly widows, widowers, and combined sample.In Step 1, the demographic variables were entered as a block followed by the three traditional measures (social resources, number of negative life events, and physical health problems) in Step 2. The eight existential variables were entered in Step 3, followed by the respective interactions of four key existential variables with physical health in Step 4.The order of entry of the blocks was based on methodological, historical, and theoretical considerations in the literature on bereavement and well-being factors in general, and the corresponding literature on differences in men's and women's responses to grief (see Campbell and Silverman 1999   ; Conant 1996   ; Fry 1992   ; Gallagher-Thompson et al. 1993   ; Lund, Caserta and Dimond 1993   ; McCrae and Costa 1993   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ; Stroebe and Stroebe 1983   ). The demographics were entered first as a control for all study variables, followed by the three traditional variables of social support, physical health problems, and negative life events that have been investigated in previous studies of bereavement and spousal loss (e.g., Murrell and Himmelfarb 1989   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ). The block of eight existential variables was entered in a later step (Step 3) primarily because these predictor variables, with few exceptions (e.g., Ross 1988   ) had not been examined in prior studies of psychological well-being following bereavement. By entering the set of eight existential variables in Step 3, the expectation was that this would provide a more discriminating and robust test of their unique contribution to the psychological well-being of bereaved men and women, in general, and psychological well-being of elderly men and women who had experienced a specific form of bereavement, namely spousal loss. Finally, the interaction of a few key existential variables and physical health was studied last of all in Step 4. The Step 4 analysis was predicated on the premise that among individuals who are bereaved and at the same time in poor health, the contribution of key existential variables (personal meaning, importance of religion, optimism, and accessibility to religious support) might interact significantly with the traditional variable of Physical Health Problems (see Morgan 1994   ).The order of entry of the independent variable blocks also took into account the general cautions concerning linear regression suggested by Cohen and Cohen 1983   . Procedure Data for the study were collected as part of the author's longitudinal study on the adjustment and coping patterns of elderly widows and widowers (Fry 1998   , Fry 1999a   , Fry 1999b   ). Several participants in this study had previously participated in Fry 1998    study on coping with spousal loss. The present study reports only on a subset of 14 variables: Sociodemographics (3), Traditional Measures (3), and Existential Variables (8), which were hypothesized to be predictors of psychological well-being in both samples of widows and widowers. Participants completed the measures at their own pace, at home or in their place of work and study, and arranged to drop off the materials at prearranged pick-up centers. On average, respondents returned the completed measures within a 2-week period. Results It will be recalled that a hierarchical regression analysis was done on the data derived from three demographic variables, three traditional variables, and eight existential variables for community-residing samples of elderly widows and widowers. Means and standard deviations on all psychosocial variables assessed are presented in  Table 2  .Consistent with predictions, widowers, compared to widows, were found to have significantly fewer social resources and contacts. Their participation in organized religious activity was significantly lower than their female counterparts, and so were their self-reportings on spirituality, beliefs, and practices. They attached significantly less importance to religion and they reported deriving less comfort from religious activity during times of stress and crises. Widows, compared to widowers, had a significantly higher frequency of negative life events and a higher frequency of physical health problems. However, compared to their male counterparts, they had a higher sense of psychological well-being and sense of personal meaning.The bivariate correlations of psychological well-being with demographic variables and other traditional and existential predictor variables are presented in  Table 3  . For widowers, none of the demographic variables were significantly related to psychological well-being; for widows, income showed a significantly stronger relationship to psychological well-being. With the exception of "comfort derived from religion" for the sample of widowers, all of the remaining psychosocial variables were significantly related to the psychological well-being of both widows and widowers. The overall pattern of associations between psychological well-being and psychosocial predictor variables was noticeably stronger for the sample of elderly widows.As a test of possible multicollinearity, the intercorrelations among the predictor variables were calculated (Cohen and Cohen 1983   ). For the sample of elderly widows, the intercorrelations ranged from –.16 to .36, median = .10; for the elderly widowers, the intercorrelations ranged from –.12 to .43, median = .12. Thus, multicollinearity does not appear to be a concern in this study.In the hierarchical regression model used in this research, the R2 change reveals information on the variance in psychological well-being explained by each block. Within each block of variables (Demographics, Traditional Measures, Existential Variables, and Interactions of Key Existential Variables with Physical Health), the standardized regression weights provide information on the relative contribution of individual variables. Results of the hierarchical regression analysis are provided in  Table 4  . The Widows Sample For elderly widows, the demographics failed to account for a significant variance in psychological well-being, and none of the individual variables made a unique contribution. The traditional measures (Social Resources and Contacts, Number of Negative Life Events, and Physical Health Problems), when entered together in Step 2, accounted for a significant increase in explained variance (13%). All three variables, Social Resources (Beta = .39, p < .001), Negative Life Events (Beta = –.41, p < .001), and Physical Health Problems (Beta = .25, p < .01) made a significant and unique contribution to the prediction of psychological well-being of widows. With demographic and traditional variables controlled, the existential variables, when entered together in Step 3, accounted for a significant and unique increase in explained variance in psychological well-being of widows (28%). Personal Meaning (Beta = .22, p < .05), Spiritual Beliefs and Practices (Beta = .23, p < .05), Importance of Religion (Beta = .25, p < .01), Comfort from Religion (Beta = .26, p < .01), and Optimism (Beta = .28, p < .01) all emerged as the most salient predictors of psychological well-being among the sample of widows. However, the Existential Variables of Personal Meaning, Importance of Religion, Accessibility to Religious Support, and Optimism by Health Interactions failed to account for additional significant variance in psychological well-being of widows. The Widowers Sample A similar hierarchical analysis was performed for the sample of elderly widowers, and the analysis yielded similar patterns of predictors of psychological well-being. For the elderly widowers, the demographic variables accounted for 10% of the variance in psychological well-being, a significant contribution. Closer inspection showed that Education contributed significantly to the prediction of psychological well-being of widowers (Beta = .22, p < .05). The addition of the traditional measures of Social Resources, Negative Life Events, and Physical Health Problems in Step 2 resulted in a sizable and significant increase in the explained variance in psychological well-being (18%). Again, a closer inspection showed that Social Resources and Contacts (Beta = .42, p < .001) contributed most to the prediction of psychological well-being, while Physical Health Problems (Beta = –.27, p < .01) made a smaller yet significant contribution. After controlling for demographics and the traditional measures, the existential variables made a surprisingly sizable and significant contribution to the prediction of psychological well-being of widowers, accounting for 27% of the variance. Personal meaning emerged as the most potent existential predictor (Beta = .40, p < .001), followed by optimism, which was also a salient predictor (Beta = .29, p < .01). Importance of religion made a smaller yet significant contribution to the explained variance in psychological well-being (Beta = .16, p < .05). The existential variables of Personal Meaning, Importance of Religion, Optimism, and Accessibility to Religious Support by Health interactions failed to account for additional significant variance. The Combined Sample The hierarchical analysis on the combined sample of elderly widows and widowers showed that all key demographic variables, traditional measures, and existential variables contributed significantly to the prediction of psychological well-being. However, the Existential Variables by Health interactions failed to account for significant variance in psychological well-being. As seen in  Table 4  , the demographic variables entered together accounted for 8% of the variance in psychological well-being. Among the demographic variables, two factors of Education (Beta = .21, p < .05) and Income (Beta = .19, p < .05) contributed significantly to the prediction of psychological well-being of widows and widowers combined. In other words, the indications are that having a high education and high income predicted higher psychological well-being. Among the traditional measures, all three variables of Social Resources and Contacts (Beta = .48, p < .001), Negative Life Events (Beta = –.29, p < .001) and Physical Health Problems (Beta = –.27, p < .001) emerged as salient predictors of psychological well-being. Entered together, the traditional measures accounted for a sizable significant increase in explained variance (18%) in psychological well-being of the combined sample of widows and widowers. As seen in  Table 4  , when all existential variables were entered together for the combined sample, they accounted for a sizable and significant percentage (21%) of the explained variance in psychological well-being. Closer examination showed that among the existential variables, Personal Meaning (Beta = .24, p < .001) and Importance of Religion (Beta = .28, p < .001) emerged as the most salient predictors, while Spiritual Beliefs and Practices (Beta = .20, p < .05), Accessibility to Religious Support (Beta = .17, p < .05), and Optimism (Beta = .19, p < .05) made a smaller yet significant contribution to accounting for additional variance.The existential variables of Personal Meaning, Importance of Religion, Optimism, and Accessibility to Religious Support by Health interactions failed to account for additional significant variance. Discussion The results of this study support the importance of several existential variables, such as Personal Meaning, Optimism, Importance of Religion, and Accessibility to Religious Support in the prediction of psychological well-being, both in the individual sample of widows and widowers, and also in the combined sample. Of particular note is the fact that these existential variables accounted for reliable and unique variance in psychological well-being of both widows and widowers after the demographic variables and traditional measures of social resources and contacts, negative life events, and physical health problems were all controlled and taken into account. The present results, with measures tapping several existential constructs, have replicated and extended previous studies suggesting a link between older adults' personal meaning, optimism, religiosity, and successful coping with the challenges and stresses of spousal loss in late life (see Conant 1996   ; Fry 1998   ; Fry 1999b   ; Jaffe 1985   ; Lund et al. 1993   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ). Consistent with indications from earlier research on bereavement (Idler and Kasl 1992   ; Koenig 1988   ; Young and Dowling 1987   ), the findings support the speculation that several specific dimensions of personal meaning for life, religiosity, and spirituality may alleviate the depression and anxiety of men and women following spousal loss, and provide hope and comfort. This is especially true for elderly widows in this study who, more clearly than widowers, indicated the comfort they derived from religion, from spiritual beliefs and practices, and from accessibility to religious support. For both elderly widows and widowers, the findings highlight the view that although health, income, education, social resources, and stress of negative life events continue to be reliable predictors of psychological well-being, several collective existential dimensions of personal meaning for life, optimism for the future, and aspects of religiosity and spirituality (which have not been measured explicitly in earlier studies) are, by far, sounder predictors of psychological well-being and coping with the distress of spousal loss. The eight existential constructs (e.g., Personal Meaning, Optimism, Importance of Religion, Accessibility to Religious Support) examined in the study accounted for 28%, 27%, and 21%, respectively, of the variance within the individual samples of widows and widowers, and the combined sample. This is after the various demographic and traditional variables were controlled and accounted for. Implications for Practitioners Although this study did not examine causal factors in psychological well-being of widows and widowers, the findings permit the speculation, if not the conclusion, that several existential constructs and dimensions of religiosity, comfort derived from prayer in a time of distress and loss, and spirituality and personal meaning are valid and reliable predictors of psychological well-being and adjustment to the role of widowhood. These variables may take on added meaning when placed in the context of grief and bereavement work with widowers, in particular.The findings show clearly that psychological well-being of widowers, compared to widows, was at a lower level. In terms of mean ratings, postbereavement men had significantly fewer social, psychological, and religious/spiritual resources and contacts. These findings support the hypothesis for the study and are not at variance with the observations of practitioners concerned with organizing programs of self-care for widowed individuals (e.g., Caserta et al. 1999   ). Recently, a number of professionals in community services have stressed the urgent need to strengthen psychological resources of widowers who, compared to widows, are at greater risk for social isolation, depression, and physical health problems following spousal death. Campbell and Silverman 1999   , who have worked extensively with widowers and observed their lack of emotional resources, also stress the need to integrate more religious involvement, spirituality, and shared interactive experiences into grief work for men. Yalom and Lieberman 1993    similarly discuss ways and means to stimulate and heighten existential involvement for individuals facing suffering and distress (see discussions by Miller 1999   , and his associates, Tonigan, Toscova, and Connors 1999   , Yahne and Miller 1999   ).The general implication for counselors working with bereaved spouses is that they must find ways to stimulate and reinforce the "will to live" and stimulate personal meaning or purpose for life. If religiosity indicators are low, alternate strategies that rely on personal growth and spirituality may be explored to enhance meaning for life (St. John 1999   ).Researchers, practitioners, and health providers must come to recognize that the phenomenon of spousal loss cannot be understood simply within the context of its accompanying stressors and secondary strains. Stress-coping paradigms and existential paradigms, when used in a complementary manner in research and in practical programs of grief work for bereaved spouses, are likely to yield greater insight into existential aspects of the distress, suffering, and adversity that accompany spousal loss. What social, personal, religious, and spiritual resources are needed to combat the stress and distress of spousal loss must also be understood from the frameworks of both the stress-coping model and the existential model.A word of caution, however, is important. Given that evidence concerning the association of multidimensional measures of religiosity, spirituality, personal meaning, psychological well-being, and bereavement is still developing, interpretations and implications offered for grief work and therapy should be regarded as preliminary. Limitations of the Study A number of methodological issues may have affected the veracity of the findings and should be considered as limitations of this study. First, as with any study of such a sensitive nature as spousal loss and bereavement, the use of volunteer participants presents an important limitation that relates to the sampling framework. Second, it should be noted that almost 85% of the volunteer participants had experienced spousal loss in the last 12 to 16 months; the number of participants in the 6-month to 11-month postbereavement period, and in the 16-month and longer postbereavement period, was therefore extremely limited. Inadequate sample size at various postbereavement stages prohibited a separate analysis aimed at studying the relationship between length of postbereavement and psychological well-being. A study of participants who had experienced spousal loss more recently than 12 months ago, or after a postbereavement period longer than 16 months, may possibly have yielded different findings. Third, the present study is cross-sectional, and as is true of all cross-sectional analyses, we can only speculate at this time on the long-term salutory influence of existential factors (such as personal meaning, religiousness, and spirituality) on older adults' coping with loss.In spite of these shortcomings, we hope the work reported here sparks further interest in the relationship of existential factors to psychological well-being of bereaved spouses. Given the increasing evidence that existential factors such as meaning, religion, and optimism for life serve certain health-protective functions (Ellison and Levin 1998   ), a more extensive understanding of these processes and how they are related to bereavement is essential. Future Research Future research pertaining to the psychological well-being of widows and widowers, with respect to predictors, should pursue supplementary qualitative data gathering to explore in detail the precise influence of religion, spirituality, comfort from religion, and religious meaning for life after spousal loss. Further qualitative research is necessary to explore the salience of existential involvement and how it serves as a buffer against the distress of loss and bereavement, especially in old age. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies (triangulation) is strongly recommended, and such procedures may assist in the formulation of more specific hypotheses for future research and extended programs of bereavement counseling and therapy for widows and widowers.Finally, researchers must consider the significance of using both stress/coping and existential paradigms in future research on adjustment to bereavement in late life functioning (see Fry 1998   , Fry 1999a   , Fry 1999b   ).

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined the prevalence, correlates, and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults. Design and Methods: The authors analyzed cross-sectional data from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey's Supplement on Aging. Data were weighted to be representative of the noninstitutionalized population aged 70 years and older. Results: Overall, 20.7% of those needing help to perform 1 or more ADLs (an estimated 629,000 persons) reported receiving inadequate assistance; for individual ADLs, the prevalence of unmet need ranged from 10.2% (eating) to 20.1% (transferring). The likelihood of having 1 or more unmet needs was associated with lower household income, multiple ADL difficulties, and living alone. Nearly half of those with unmet needs reported experiencing a negative consequence (e.g., unable to eat when hungry) as a result of their unmet need. Implications: Greater, targeted efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence and consequences of unmet need for ADL assistance in elderly persons.   Elderly persons ,  ADLs ,  Disability ,  Living arrangements Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDMany elderly persons living in the community have difficulty performing basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as eating, walking, and toileting. Often, individuals are able to overcome such difficulties through the use of assistive devices (see, e.g., Hartke, Prohaska, and Furner 1998   ; Manton, Corder, and Stallard 1993   ; Verbrugge, Rennert, and Madans 1997   ). In many instances, however, disabled elderly persons need help from others (i.e., personal assistance) to perform ADLs (Norburn et al. 1995   ). If the need for assistance goes unmet, older adults may be at risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, including increased health services utilization and depression (Allen and Mor 1997   ) as well as institutionalization (Chenier 1997   ; Tennstedt, McKinlay, and Kasten 1994   ). Current estimates of need and unmet need for ADL personal assistance may serve as an indicator of future need for long-term care services (Tennstedt et al. 1994   ).To help reduce the burden of unmet need and to facilitate the development and targeting of in-home and community-based services, it is important that we determine the prevalence and correlates of unmet need for personal assistance with ADLs. To date, however, few population-based studies have sought to address this issue. Analyzing data from the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), Manton 1989    found that, among community-dwelling older adults with chronic disability, the prevalence of unmet need for ADL assistance ranged from 1.4% (eating) to 27.9% (toileting). Overall, more than a third (34.6%) of the disabled population aged 65 years and older reported an unmet need for assistance with one or more ADLs. Prevalence of unmet need was strongly associated with increasing age and level of disability.Using different definitions of disability, need, and unmet need, Allen and Mor 1997    conducted a telephone survey of disabled adults in Springfield, Massachusetts, and found that the prevalence of unmet need for assistance with ADLs ranged from 4.3% (eating) to 22.6% (bathing) among those aged 65 and older. Unmet need was significantly more likely among persons with two or fewer reliable helpers and among those who were more severely impaired. The authors also found that a substantial proportion of elderly persons with unmet needs experienced serious, negative consequences as a result of receiving inadequate personal assistance. In another study of disabled elderly persons (aged 70 years and older) in Massachusetts, Tennstedt and colleagues 1994    reported that less than 10% of respondents had an unmet need for assistance with personal care ADLs and that the likelihood of unmet need was significantly associated with level of disability.From a national policy and planning perspective, these previous findings are somewhat limited insofar as they are based on older data or on data from a limited geographic region. In contrast, in the present study we used recent data from a nationally representative sample of older adults to address the following objectives: (a) to derive estimates of need and unmet need for ADL personal assistance; (b) to identify correlates of unmet need; and (c) building on the work of Allen and Mor 1997   , to examine the prevalence and correlates of negative consequences of unmet need for ADL assistance. Methods Data Source and Analytic Sample Data for these analyses come from the Second Supplement on Aging (SOA II) to the 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging. Covering a broad range of health topics, the NHIS is a household survey that is administered annually to a multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States (Massey, Moore, Parsons, and Tadros 1989   ). Approximately 1 year after the 1994 NHIS was conducted, household members aged 70 years and older were recontacted, and 9,447 of these individuals completed the SOA II (NCHS 1998   ). Reflecting the U.S. population aged 70 and older in 1995, the weighted SOA II sample had a mean age of 77.3 years and was 60% female and 90% White.Trained interviewers from the U.S. Bureau of the Census collected SOA II data through face-to-face, in-home interviews. Assisted and proxy interviews (6% and 11%, respectively) were allowed for elderly persons who were unable to participate on their own because of illness or impairment. Data were collected on various aspects of health and well-being in later life, such as sociodemographic characteristics, living arrangements, and measures of physical health and functioning, including ADLs.The SOA II interview included a series of questions about seven ADLs: (a) bathing or showering; (b) dressing; (c) eating; (d) getting in and out of bed or chairs (i.e., transferring); (e) walking; (f) getting outside; and (g) using the toilet, including getting to the toilet (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffe 1963   ). For each ADL, respondents were first asked whether or not, because of a health or physical problem, they had any difficulty performing the activity (by themselves and without using special equipment). For the purposes of this study, we defined disability as difficulty performing ADLs. The prevalence of ADL disability ranged from 2.5% (eating) to 23.9% (walking). Overall, nearly 30% of all persons aged 70 and older reported difficulty performing one or more ADLs. Excluding individuals who reported no difficulty performing ADLs (see  Fig. 1 ), we focused the analyses of this study on older adults with ADL disabilities. Personal Assistance With ADLs After asking respondents whether they had difficulty performing individual ADLs, interviewers asked study participants whether or not they received assistance from another person when performing a given activity, and whether or not they needed (or needed more) personal assistance. Personal assistance was defined as either hands-on help or supervisory/standby help. On the basis of the answers to these questions, we categorized disabled respondents as having no need, met need, or unmet need for personal assistance with ADLs (see  Fig. 1 ). As  Fig. 1  illustrates, individuals were categorized as having no need for personal assistance with a given ADL if they reported having difficulty performing the activity, but not receiving and not needing personal assistance. Respondents were categorized as having a met need if they reported having difficulty and receiving personal assistance, but not needing more assistance. Those who reported having difficulty and needing more personal assistance than they were receiving, if any, were categorized as having an unmet need. Negative Consequences of Unmet Need For four of the seven ADLs, the SOA II interviewers asked respondents whether or not they had experienced (during the past month) any negative consequences as a result of inadequate personal assistance. For example, respondents who reported experiencing either (a) discomfort because they were not able to bathe as often as they would have liked or (b) a burn or scald caused by bathing with water that was too hot were regarded as having experienced a negative consequence of unmet need for personal assistance with bathing/showering. Similar sorts of questions were asked for dressing, eating, and toileting (see  Table 1  ).Respondents who reported difficulty walking were asked how often they moved around their house/apartment. Multiple-choice answers ranged from "whenever [I] want" to "not often enough even to use the bathroom." Those who reported mobility restriction (i.e., something other than "whenever [I] want") were categorized as having had a negative consequence of unmet need for personal assistance with walking. In the SOA II interview, questions regarding negative consequences of unmet need were not asked for the remaining two ADLs, that is, transferring and getting outside. Potential Correlates Sociodemographic characteristics, number of chronic conditions, and level of ADL disability were considered as potential correlates of unmet need and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assistance with ADLs. Specifically, we included the following sociodemographic variables in the analysis: sex, age (70–74, 75–79, 80–84, ≥85 years), race (White, Black, or other), education (<12 or ≥12 years), annual household income (<$20,000 or ≥$20,000), and living arrangements (alone or not alone).Respondents reported whether or not they had ever had (a) a broken hip; (b) osteoporosis; (c) diabetes; (d) arthritis; (e) chronic bronchitis or emphysema; (f) asthma; (g) hypertension; (h) heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or myocardial infarction); (i) any other heart disease; (j) a stroke or cerebrovascular accident; or (k) cancer. We calculated a summary score and categorized respondents as having had zero to one, two to three, or four or more chronic conditions. Level of ADL disability was defined according to the number of ADLs an individual had difficulty performing (one to two, three to four, or five to seven ADLs). Because assisted and proxy interviews were allowed in SOA II data collection, our analyses also included a variable for respondent status (self, assisted, or proxy). Data Analysis Among persons with ADL difficulties, we determined the overall distribution of need (i.e., no need, met need, or unmet need) for personal assistance with ADLs. Then, focusing on those individuals who reported need (either met need or unmet need) for assistance, we reexamined level of unmet need. Next, we determined the proportion of individuals who had experienced a negative consequence as a result of their unmet need. Finally, chi-squared and logistic regression analyses (Agresti 1990   ) were performed to identify correlates of both unmet need and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assistance with one or more ADLs. The multivariate analysis employed a backward elimination strategy (Kleinbaum 1994   ). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. We performed all analyses using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, and Bieler 1996   ) to take into account the survey's complex sample design; this allowed for appropriate variance estimation and weighting of the data. Results As the results in  Table 2  show, substantial numbers of older adults have difficulty performing basic activities of daily living; it is estimated that more than 6.2 million adults aged 70 and older had difficulty performing one or more ADLs in 1995. Among those who had difficulty performing individual ADLs, the prevalence of unmet need for assistance ranged from 6.2% for eating to 11.7% for bathing/showering. Considering only persons with need (either met need or unmet need) for assistance, estimates of unmet need ranged from 10.2% for eating to 20.1% for transferring. Overall, 48.7% of older adults with ADL difficulties (or an estimated 3 million persons aged 70 and older) reported needing some sort of personal assistance with one or more ADLs, and, of those individuals with need, 20.7% (or an estimated 629,000 persons) had an unmet need. Nearly half (47.6%) of respondents with an unmet need for ADL personal assistance reported experiencing a negative consequence as a result of their unmet need.Correlates of unmet need for ADL personal assistance are presented in  Table 3  . Prevalence of unmet need did not significantly vary by age, race, or number of chronic conditions. After adjusting for other sample characteristics, neither sex nor education was independently associated with unmet need. In multivariate analysis, respondents whose annual household income was less than $20,000, who lived alone, and who had difficulty performing an increasing number of ADLs were at increased risk of having an unmet need for personal assistance. In addition, participants with a proxy respondent were less likely to have unmet needs. Table 4  presents correlates of negative consequences of unmet need for ADL personal assistance. The likelihood of experiencing negative consequences of unmet need was significantly associated with lower income and increasing level of ADL disability. None of the other sociodemographic and health status variables considered were associated with negative consequences. Discussion Using data from a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling elderly persons, we found that approximately 3 million persons aged 70 and older needed personal assistance to perform one or more ADLs in 1995. Overall, fully one fifth of those needing help reported receiving inadequate assistance, half of whom had recently experienced a negative consequence as a result of their unmet need. Low-income elderly persons and those with multiple ADL difficulties were at increased risk for both having an unmet need and experiencing a negative consequence as a result. Those who lived alone were more than twice as likely to have unmet needs, though no more likely to report negative consequences.It is difficult to compare estimates of unmet need for ADL assistance across studies, because of considerable differences in study methods; sample characteristics; and definitions of disability, need, and unmet need. Whether we use all persons reporting difficulty performing a given ADL or only those needing assistance as the denominator, our estimates of unmet need differ from those previously reported (Allen and Mor 1997   ; Manton 1989   ; Tennstedt et al. 1994   ). For most ADLs, we found higher rates of unmet need for assistance than either Manton 1989    or Tennstedt and colleagues 1994   . This may be explained, at least in part, by our more comprehensive definition of unmet need: Whereas the two earlier studies asked only respondents receiving no help at all whether or not they needed help, we additionally asked those receiving some help whether or not they needed more help (similar to Allen and Mor 1997   ). Moreover, the relatively low rates of unmet need reported by Tennstedt and colleagues 1994    may reflect the fact that their analysis focused on a select subsample of study participants who were still alive and community-dwelling 2 years following baseline interview. The higher rates of unmet need reported by Allen and Mor 1997    may, in part, be attributed to their assessment of need in the past month (1-month period prevalence) as opposed to need at the present time (point prevalence).Consistent with other studies (Allen and Mor 1997   ; Manton 1989   ; Tennstedt et al. 1994   ), on the other hand, was the finding that level of ADL disability (defined as the number of ADLs an individual had difficulty performing) was the strongest predictor of unmet need. The positive association between severity of disability and prevalence of unmet need for assistance likely reflects the fact that elderly persons with more ADL difficulties require more personal care, thereby increasing the likelihood that caregivers will not be able to satisfy all needs. The importance of the observed association between level of ADL disability and prevalence of unmet need is underscored by findings that increased disability and caregiver burden often precipitate the transition from community living to institutionalization (Chenier 1997   ).In this study, we also found that disabled elderly persons whose annual household income was less than $20,000 were more likely to report receiving inadequate personal assistance with ADLs. Although Tennstedt and colleagues 1994    did not find an association between income and unmet need, Allen and Mor 1997    reported that the number of routine expenses one could not afford (a proxy for income) was positively associated with the number of unmet ADL needs (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.99-1.30). Similarly, in a study of cancer outpatients (Siegel, Raveis, Houts, and Mor 1991   ), unmet needs were significantly more likely among those eligible for Medicaid or public assistance. In these data, we did not find an association between insurance status and unmet need. More than 95% of the sample had Medicare; in addition, 21% had Medicaid and 64% had private insurance. Prevalence of unmet need for personal assistance with one or more ADLs did not differ according to presence or absence of Medicaid (21.2% vs. 20.6%, respectively, p = .84) or presence or absence of private insurance (19.8% vs. 23.0%, respectively, p = .23). These data suggest that elderly persons living in lower income households are less likely to be able to pay for formal care when the level of informal caregiving is insufficient. There is longitudinal evidence that increased access to formal in-home services may contribute to continued community living among disabled elderly persons (Tennstedt, Crawford, and McKinlay 1993b   ).Older adults with multiple ADL difficulties and limited financial resources were at increased risk for not only having unmet needs but also experiencing negative consequences of unmet needs. It is of great concern that nearly half of those with unmet needs experienced one or more negative consequences, because many of the negative consequences (such as not being able to eat when hungry and experiencing a burn or scald when bathing) had the potential to seriously threaten the health and safety of those with unmet needs.Our finding that older adults who lived alone were twice as likely as those who lived with others to report an unmet need for personal assistance is consistent with an extensive body of literature on instrumental social support (e.g., Langford, Bowsher, Maloney, and Lillis 1997   ) and informal caregiving (e.g., Robinson 1997   ). As expected, in the majority of cases, a disabled respondent's spouse or child was the primary caregiver. A more detailed analysis of household composition, marital status, and availability of children supported the findings of Chappell 1991    and Tennstedt, Crawford, and McKinlay 1993a    that coresidence is often more important than kinship tie per se in determining patterns of informal care and use of formal services. The fact that those who live alone are especially vulnerable to having unmet needs is important in light of the fact that, over time, an increasing proportion of the oldest-old, particularly women, are living alone (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1996   ).We also found that participants with a proxy respondent were less likely to have unmet needs. Although we believe this likely reflects the fact that those with an available proxy are more likely to need and, indeed, receive personal assistance with ADLs, the association may stem from proxies' greater unwillingness to report unmet need, fearing that doing so would negatively reflect on their own caregiving adequacy. To the extent that the latter is true, unmet need for ADL personal assistance would be underestimated. Notably, the same correlates of unmet need and negative consequences of unmet need were found when we restricted the sample to self-respondents only.Although the majority of older adults who have difficulty performing basic ADLs have either no need or met need for personal assistance, a substantial proportion of disabled elderly persons continue to have unmet needs and experience negative consequences as a result. Most of the assistance that a community-dwelling elderly person receives is provided informally by family caregivers; in some instances, this care is supplemented by formal services. Because individuals whose needs for assistance go unmet may be at risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, it is important that the likelihood of having unmet needs be minimized. Greater, targeted efforts are needed to identify at-risk older persons living in the community and to provide services (e.g., home care, community-based services, assistive devices, and residential modifications) that may reduce the burden of unmet need. In the present study, we identified broad sociodemographic and health status factors associated with unmet need and negative consequences of unmet need for ADL personal assistance. Further studies are needed to identify and overcome specific barriers to receiving help and services (e.g., inability to pay and lack of accessibility or availability in one's area). Future work should consider the effectiveness of targeting potentially vulnerable populations, such as older adults living in low-income housing or poor rural communities.Follow-up data are currently being collected on SOA II respondents. In future studies, we will be able to examine the longitudinal effects of having unmet needs for ADL personal assistance in terms of outcomes such as functional decline, medical visits, hospitalizations, institutionalization, and mortality.

     Abstract Purpose: The present study examined the relationships between the frequency and functions of reminiscence, personality styles, and psychological functioning. There is little research on the psychological factors that correlate with reminiscence, especially in relationship to clinical constructs such as depression and anxiety. Research in the area of reminiscence functions may facilitate a better understanding of the factors affecting change in reminiscence therapies. Design and Methods: Seventy-seven healthy older adults completed the following self-report scales: Reminiscence Functions Scale, NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory—Second Edition, State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Templer-McMordie Death Anxiety Scale. Results:Using canonical correlation techniques, results indicated that individuals with negative psychological functioning frequently reminisce as a way to refresh bitter memories, reduce boredom, and prepare for death. Implications: The present study provides implications for both researchers and clinicians. Contrary to previous studies, results indicate that depressed and anxious older adults commonly use reminiscence and therefore may be appropriate candidates for reminiscence treatments.   Anxiety ,  Depression ,  Death anxiety Laurence G. Branch, PhDReminiscence, the recalling of memories from one's past experiences, is a multidimensional process that occurs in people of all ages. Butler 1963    described reminiscence as a part of the normal life review process brought about by the realization of death and viewed the use of the past as a mechanism that aids individuals in preparing for death by mitigating fear and anxiety. Contrary to prior assumptions, age does not necessarily predict the frequency of reminiscence (Romaniuk and Romaniuk 1983   ; Webster 1994   ). However, older adults, compared with younger reminiscers, use past experiences for different purposes. Molinari and Reichlin 1984    suggested that reminiscence for older adults reflects qualitative rather than quantitative differences. For example, older adults tend to use their memories primarily as a source of entertainment, whereas young people use their memories mainly as a problem-solving tool (Revere and Tobin 1980   ). In addition, research has shown that older adults fluctuate with respect to the frequency and degree of pleasantness associated with reminiscence (Fry 1991   ).Much of the reminiscence literature has focused on the clinical applications of reminiscence and life-review groups in relation to outcome factors such as depression and anxiety. Although literature supports the use of such treatments through group psychotherapy (Goldwasser, Auerbach, and Harkins 1987   ; Haight 1991   ; Rattenberg and Stones 1989   ), much of this information is anecdotal or involves group comparison outcome methodologies, which have traditionally neglected an examination of the factors affecting symptom relief or behavioral change. Haight 1991    comprehensively examined reminiscence treatments and noted that there is a continued need to define the factors that lead to successful reminiscing.Wong and Watt 1991   , in one of the few studies examining reminiscence functions in relation to adaptive aging, developed a taxonomy of six reminiscence types to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful aging. Their model consisted of integrative, instrumental, transmissive, narrative, escapist, and obsessive forms of reminiscence. Results indicated that successful agers showed significantly more integrative and instrumental forms of reminiscence, which primarily function to reconcile the past, attain a sense of self-worth, and problem solve. Similarly, Wong and Watt found that successful agers had lower levels of obsessive reminiscence (Lo Gerfo 1980   ), which included a ruminative style of accessing the past resulting from guilt, stress, or grief and evidenced by bitterness or despair.Preliminary research has indicated that certain personality traits may facilitate reminiscence, and others may inhibit it (Lieberman and Falk 1971   ). Fry 1991    found that specific personality factors are strong predictors of the frequency and pleasantness of reminiscence activity, postulating that individuals who have a "delicate balance" of such personality traits as sentience and openness may have a greater capacity for, and be more responsive to, reminiscence as a therapeutic process.Several studies have explored the relationship between reminiscence and personality, using both Webster 1993    Reminiscence Functions Scale (RFS) and the NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory (NEO–FFI). Webster 1993    found that bitterness revival reminiscence correlated with Neuroticism, conversation reminiscence correlated with Extraversion, and both identity and problem-solving reminiscence correlated with Openness. Webster 1994    indicated that the personality traits of openness and neuroticism were found to be significantly correlated with overall reminiscence frequency, whereas persons high in neuroticism were more likely to experience negative emotions when they reminisced. However, the generalizability of these findings to an older adult population appears limited, due to the small sample size of adults age 63 and up (n = 13). Finally, Molinari, Cully, Kendjelic, and Kunik in press    examined the relationship between personality factors and reminiscence functions in an outpatient geriatric psychiatry population. Results indicated positive correlations between Extraversion and conversation and Openness with identity and problem-solving reminiscence functions.Regarding reminiscence and depression, several studies have found that depressed individuals may be prone to reminisce using memories with a negative emotional valence (Fromholt, Larsen, and Larsen 1995   ; Mathews and MacLeod 1994   ; Matt, Vazques, and Campbell 1992   ). Other research with older adults has noted that depressed participants may have difficulty in reminiscing owing to repeated interruptions by anxious concerns about their current physical and emotional condition (McMahon and Rhudick 1967   ). Levy and Mineka 1998    examined the effects of anxiety on autobiographical memory within a college population. Results indicated that low-anxious participants recalled more memories overall than did high-anxious participants. Using an older adult sample, Lieberman and Falk 1971    found that individuals under stress tended to reminisce less frequently, reflecting on more painful and negative aspects in recounting their life stories. In addition, results indicated that individuals under stress tended to emphasize childhood memories in lieu of adult memories.Previous findings related to the effect of death anxiety on life review and reminiscence have been mixed, with few conclusions drawn (Fishman 1992   ; Lieberman and Falk 1971   ; Quackenbush and Barnett 1995   ). The conflicting findings may be due in part to differences in construct definitions and a lack of well-validated measures.To summarize, reminiscence research has not carefully examined the therapeutic components of reminiscence treatments. Researchers have suggested that reminiscence and life-review therapies will be more valuable if studies target and assess the factors associated with positive change. A logical step in using reminiscence as a treatment modality would be to identify the salient characteristics and relationships between reminiscence and psychological constructs that are targeted for treatment, such as depression, anxiety, and death anxiety, conditions common among older adults. Research Questions/Hypotheses The current study was primarily exploratory in nature; we sought to examine the relationships between reminiscence functions, personality, and psychological functioning. On the basis of previous literature, we proposed the following hypotheses:Negative reminiscence functions (e.g., bitterness revival and boredom reduction) were predicted to correlate positively with psychological distress. Positive forms of reminiscence (e.g., death preparation, identity, and problem solving) would negatively correlate with psychological distress.Bitterness revival was predicted to be positively correlated with depression and anxiety.Higher levels of psychological distress were predicted to correlate negatively with reminiscence frequency. Methods Participants Eighty-three participants age 65 and older were recruited from several independent living facilities (n = 71) and from a private university alumni foundation (n = 12) in a Midwestern metropolitan city. These individuals were generally well educated (mean years of education = 13) and reported few major medical conditions (e.g., stroke or heart attack). Potential participants completed the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ) to determine if they were cognitively intact. Participants with scores of 24 and above were entered into the final analysis. Of the 83 independent living facility participants, 6 scored below the MMSE cutoff of 24, leaving a final sample size of 77.  Table 1  provides a complete list of sample means and standard deviations for demographic variables and psychological measures. Procedures Participants were recruited through personal contact, flyers, and scheduled group administration sessions. The majority of measures were completed during group administrations in the presence of an examiner. Participants were placed in an environment where they could complete the protocol in private, free from distractions. To avoid potential order and response bias effects, measures were counterbalanced for order of presentation. Measures Reminiscence: The RFS. The RFS is a 43-item questionnaire in which participants are asked to rate themselves on a 6-point Likert-type scale assessing how often they reminisce with a particular function in mind (Webster 1993   ). Items in the questionnaire are presented as completions to the stems "How often do you reminisce…" and "When I reminisce it is…". Responses range from 1 = never [reminisce for the stated purpose] to 6 = very frequently [reminisce for the stated purpose]. The completed measure yields scores on eight reminiscence functions, and a total composite reminiscence score may also be computed. Webster offered the following factor definitions:Boredom Reduction is people's propensity to reminisce when their environment is understimulating and they lack engagement in goal-directed activities.Death Preparation assesses the way people use their past when thoughts of their own mortality are salient, and it may contribute to a sense of closure and calmness.Identity refers to how people use their pasts in an existential manner to discover, clarify, and crystallize important dimensions of their sense of who they are.Problem Solving is defined as how people use reminiscence as a constructive coping mechanism whereby the remembrance of past problem-solving strategies may be used again in the present.Conversation is people's natural inclination to invoke the past as a means of connecting or reconnecting with others.Intimacy Maintenance is a process whereby cognitive and emotional representations of important persons in people's lives are resurrected in lieu of the remembered person's physical presence.Bitterness Revival is the extent to which memories are used to affectively charge recalled episodes in which people perceive themselves as having been unjustly treated.The Teach/Inform factor measures the ways in which people use reminiscence to relay to others important information about life and/or themselves. It is an instructional type of narrative.The RFS has adequate to good psychometric properties. Factor internal consistency scores range from a low of .74 for Teach/Inform to a high of .86 for Identity and Problem Solving (Webster 1997   ). Research regarding the criterion validity of the measure has been positive. Webster 1993    found strong and expected correlations between NEO–FFI factors and multiple reminiscence functions. In addition, Webster 1993    examined the RFS developmentally and found significance for an increase in death preparation reminiscence with increases in age. Personality: NEO–FFI. The NEO–FFI is a shorter version of the well-known, well-validated NEO Personality Inventory (Costa and McCrae 1992   ) and consists of 60 items presented on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The inventory takes approximately 15 min to complete and yields scores on the Big Five personality factors: Neuroticism (tense, anxious, worrying, and moody), Extraversion (talkative, assertive, active, and dominant), Openness (imaginative, curious, and possessing a wide range of interests), Agreeableness (kind, affectionate, generous, and friendly), and Conscientiousness (responsible, reliable, dependable, and organized). Depression: Beck Depression Inventory—Revised (BDI–II). The BDI–II (Beck, Steer, and Brown 1996   ) is the recently revised version of the well-known BDI (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, and Erbaugh 1961   ). Items on the BDI–II are presented under subject "headings," with each item containing four sentence options. Participants are instructed to select one statement in each group that best describes the way they have been feeling for the past 2 weeks, including the present day. As the BDI–II is a relatively new inventory, little research exists for its use with older adults. However, the original BDI is a reliable and well-validated measure that has shown adequate psychometric properties with older adults in both clinical and research settings (Gallagher, Breckenridge, Steinmetz, and Thompson 1983   ; Gallagher, Nies, and Thompson 1982   ). Anxiety: State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI is the reliable and well-validated measure created by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene 1970   ; it has been found to be valid with older adults (Himmelfarb and Murrell 1983   ; Kabacoff, Segal, Hersen, and Van Hasslet 1997   ). The STAI is an objective personality test, designed for the measurement of current (state) and general (trait) anxieties. State anxiety is measured under the heading "How do you feel right now?" whereas trait anxiety, a more stable attribute, is described as the way an individual typically reacts to stressful or anxious situations. Death Anxiety: Templer-McMordie Death Anxiety Scale (TDAS). The TDAS is a widely used 15-item scale that is both a reliable and a valid measure of death anxiety (Templer 1970   ). A modified version of the TDAS was used for the current research, which uses a 7-point Likert-style format, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, in lieu of the original true–false version (McMordie 1979   ; Templer 1970   ). Internal consistency and test–retest reliability scores for the modified version of the TDAS are .84 and .83, respectively (McMordie 1979   ). On the basis of a sample of 320 undergraduates, McMordie 1979    indicated that the mean and standard deviation for the TDAS were approximately 58 and 13, respectively. Results The primary analyses were aimed at understanding the relationship between reminiscence functions and personality factors, anxiety, depression, and death anxiety. Holding the level of significance constant at p < .05, it can be seen from the two-tailed Pearson correlations in  Table 2  that Neuroticism scores correlated positively and significantly with bitterness revival, boredom reduction, death preparation, and total reminiscence. Extraversion correlated positively and significantly with conversation and teach/inform. Also significant, Agreeableness correlated negatively with bitterness revival and boredom reduction. With regard to psychological outcomes, a review of  Table 2  indicates a pattern of positive relationships between depression, anxiety, and death anxiety and the reminiscence functions of bitterness revival, boredom reduction, and death preparation, as well as total reminiscence. Canonical Correlation The canonical analysis provided a multivariate assessment of the overall relationship between the two sets of variables (psychological functioning and RFS factors), controlling for interrelationships. Canonical correlation attempts to generate a maximum correlation between the two sets of variables in the form of a variate that allows for the interpretation of those variables that contribute most significantly to the relationship. In conducting such an analysis, there may exist additional, separate variates; however, each subsequent variate produced is orthogonal to those previously generated. The current canonical analysis included a set of reminiscence variables (boredom reduction, death preparation, identity, problem solving, conversation, intimacy maintenance, bitterness revival, and teach/inform) and a collection of psychological variables that included the five NEO–FFI personality factors, depression (BDI–II), state and trait anxiety (STAI), and death anxiety (TDAS).Three of the seven canonical variates from the analyses were statistically significant beyond the .05 level. As indicated by a redundancy analysis, a total of 24% of the variance in the reminiscence factors was explained by the psychological measures, with the first variate explaining the majority (18%). An examination of the structural coefficients (see  Table 3  ) indicated that the reminiscence functions with the highest structure coefficients for Variate 1 are bitterness revival (−.95), boredom reduction (−.64), and death preparation (−.51). Structure coefficients from psychological functioning revealed that trait anxiety (−.75), neuroticism (−.76), state anxiety (−.75), depression (−.59), death anxiety (−.55), and agreeableness (.50) had the highest loadings. This first variate appears to suggest that as psychological functioning becomes "healthier" (e.g., lower levels of anxiety, depression, and death anxiety), individuals tend to use reminiscence less frequently for the purposes of bitterness revival, boredom reduction, and death preparation.The second canonical variate accounted for 4% of the variance and consisted of the RFS factors Conversation (.56) and Teach/Inform (.66) and the psychological variables extraversion (.66), openness (.63), and depression (−.63). The second variate suggests that individuals high on extraversion and openness with lower levels of depression tend to frequently reminisce for the purposes of teaching and conversing. Although the third variate generated was statistically significant, it accounted for only 2% of the variance and, accordingly, is not reported. Discussion Butler 1963    contended that if individuals used reminiscence in a negative fashion, they would be more likely to experience heightened emotional distress as evidenced by increased symptoms of both depression and anxiety. The results of the present study lend empirical support to Butler's postulate. Our analyses suggest two general themes: (a) Negative psychological functioning is positively associated with the bitterness revival, boredom reduction, and death preparation functions of reminiscence; and (b) higher levels of psychological distress (e.g., state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and death anxiety) are associated with greater reminiscence frequency.Findings indicate that as psychological distress increases, older adults may be more likely to recall bitter memories and reminisce in order to alleviate feelings of boredom as well as to deal with issues of mortality. However, due to the correlational nature of the study, the opposite may also exist: As individuals more frequently use bitterness revival, boredom reduction, and death preparation functions of reminiscence, they may be prone to psychological distress.In addition, because of the robust nature of the correlation between bitterness revival and psychological distress, one could argue that the relationships between boredom reduction and death preparation may be only indirectly related, mediated by high levels of bitterness revival. Therefore, it may be the interaction of these reminiscence functions, mediated by bitterness revival, that ultimately relates to psychological distress.In comparing the current findings with prior research, we should note that a significant difference exists in the expected level of reminiscence frequency with depressed and anxious participants. The current study found that higher levels of depression and anxiety were positively correlated with overall reminiscence frequency. These findings differ from those reported previously (Levy and Mineka 1998   ; Lieberman and Falk 1971   ; McMahon and Rhudick 1967   ). Previous researchers have suggested that higher levels of psychological distress would contribute to a difficulty in reminiscing. The current findings did not support this hypothesis but indicated that individuals with greater psychological distress exhibited to noticeable decrements in their ability to recall and use information from their past. The current findings suggested that individuals with higher psychological distress appeared to use reminiscence more frequently than their psychologically healthier counterparts. However, we should address two caveats. First, higher levels of reminiscence activity associated with "distressed" reminiscers may be due to increases in the levels of negative reminiscing, which in turn create higher levels of overall reminiscence frequency. Second, as indicated, cause cannot be inferred as to whether negative forms of reminiscing are due to high psychological distress or whether high psychological distress is influenced by negative forms of reminiscing.The current results strongly support Butler 1963    proposition that personality factors play a salient role in the types and frequencies of reminiscence activity. The results suggest that the personality variables neuroticism and extraversion appeared to be the best predictors of overall reminiscence frequency. The extraversion findings showed mixed consistency with previous studies. On the other hand, higher levels of neuroticism have been consistently associated with higher levels of reminiscence activity across studies (Molinari and associates in press   ; Webster 1994   ). Therefore, individuals higher in neuroticism may be good candidates for reminiscence group treatments.In addition to predicting overall reminiscence, we also found that several personality factors accounted for a moderate amount of variance within specific reminiscence typologies. For example, higher levels of extraversion and openness were associated with both conversation and teach/inform reminiscence. Consistent with our initial hypothesis, neuroticism was found to be positively associated with bitterness revival and boredom reduction. Finally, agreeableness was inversely related with the bitterness revival and boredom reduction forms of reminiscence.Although the results from the present study are not robust, there was a significant trend indicating that increased death anxiety is positively associated with higher levels of reminiscence geared at preparing for death. In addition, death preparation forms of reminiscence were strongly correlated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, possibly suggesting that death preparation may have both positive and negative aspects. For example, a moderate amount of death preparation may be beneficial to psychologically accept one's mortality; however, greater amounts of death preparation may begin to resemble a ruminative style of thought processes, creating distress instead of functioning as a coping mechanism. Clinical Applications Reminiscence therapy may be a clinically viable treatment modality, especially for patients suffering from depression and anxiety. Our results indicate that older adults who reported more depression and anxiety used reminiscence more frequently than their psychologically "healthier" counterparts. These individuals may have felt quite comfortable with a reminiscence intervention, as it was an activity in which they already engaged. Examining the ways in which depressed and anxious individuals used reminiscence, it appears that these individuals tended to use negative forms of reminiscence as indicated by the RFS factors of Bitterness Revival and Boredom Reduction. Therefore, clinicians may wish to focus their reminiscence treatments in the area of providing patients with a balanced look at the past, especially in the area of bitter memories. In addition, owing to the presence of the seemingly maladaptive boredom reduction strategies, clinicians may teach or focus on other, more adaptive aspects of reminiscence (e.g., problem solving, conversation, intimacy maintenance, etc.). It is believed that the RFS may ultimately aid clinicians in matching patients on their personal uses of reminiscence with treatment modalities that emphasize such functions. Future Research Replication of these findings with persons experiencing clinically significant anxiety and depression would be useful. Future research should continue to formulate an answer to the question "Why do reminiscence and life review therapies work?" specifically focusing on those factors that are suggestive of treatment efficacy. The current study can be viewed as a first step in a series of research questions. Long-term goals of such a program of research include (a) addressing the RFS's factors and their utility in helping clinicians identify individuals who will benefit from reminiscence and life-review therapies, (b) identifying the curative factors of reminiscence group treatments, and (c) identifying those techniques or treatment modalities that will be most effective within a therapeutic context, as determined by the individual's use of reminiscence.There continues to be a need to examine the RFS in terms of test–retest reliability over a sustained period of time. Similarly, it would be beneficial to assess the stability of such reminiscence typologies, especially with relation to increases or decreases in psychological distress. One critique of the RFS, in relation to past research findings, is the scale's inability to temporally categorize reminisced memories. Previous research efforts suggest that individuals who are bitter or tend to reminisce for "negative" purposes also tend to rely on early memories in lieu of their recent past. If intended for use in assessment and clinical applications, it would appear beneficial for the RFS to include items assessing the temporal sequencing of recalled memories.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The probability of anticipated return migration in retirees is explored. Design and Methods: Survey data were analyzed from interviews with a sample of elderly European Americans who migrated to a metropolitan city on Florida's east coast following retirement. Results: Results are consistent with the specification of the 2nd move in E. Litwak and C. F. Longino 1987    life course model of retirement migration. Respondents were unlikely to anticipate a return move unless ties to the back home community made such a move possible. Implications: Ties with children, both back home and in Florida, significantly influence consideration of a return move.   Retirement migration ,  Counterstream migration Decision Editor: Vernon L. Greene, PhDA dozen years have passed since Litwak and Longino 1987    introduced their life course model of retirement migration, arguing that the large streams of older migrants from the North to the Sunbelt are accompanied by much smaller counterstreams in the opposite direction. Demographers of aging have gathered inferential evidence consistent with the existence of counterstream migrants, yet researchers have yet to determine why some older migrants decide to move back to their former communities and others decide to remain in their new Sunbelt locations. In this study we addressed the anticipated likelihood of a return move among a sample of elderly people who relocated to Florida following retirement. We explored the impact of retirees' ties to their community of origin and to their new retirement community, answering the question: "Is moving back ‘going home’ or ‘leaving home’?" Background Two decades ago, Longino 1979    began reporting that there are counterstreams of older migrants returning from popular destination states like Florida to popular sending states like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The finding, first discovered in data from the 1970 Census, was confirmed (Longino 1985   ) with greater detail in 1980 Census data. That is, alongside the large stream of older migrants from New York to Florida, or from California to Arizona, there are much smaller counterstreams in the opposite direction, away from Florida or Arizona. Migration researchers expected to find these counterstreams as a natural feature of the migration landscape. Ravenstein 1889    had concluded in his Laws of Migration, promulgated more than a century ago, that a migration stream, if persistent, would beget a counterstream.The reasons seem obvious. Not everyone who moves from one place to another likes their new location, and a few of them return. Because migration studies, since Ravenstein's time, have been focused on labor force movement, the same principle is usually expressed in economic terms: Not everyone finds a job, and some return to their origin. It was thought that those with the least to offer employers would have the hardest time finding a job and would be most likely, therefore, to return. Counterstream migration consequently was said to be negatively selective, that is, to select migrants with less education and fewer job skills on average than those found in the streams. Counterstreams of elderly return migrants were also negatively selective. That is, migrants in the counterstreams were somewhat older, on average, and more often widowed and living dependently with relatives or others at their destination than were migrants in the stream.Gerontologists were left with a puzzle to solve. Why do the counterstreams of older migrants develop? There are some measurement problems in the census data that get in the way of formulating a clear answer to the question. First, there are no migration history questions among census items, so it is not known whether or not people in the counterstreams are actually "returning" to the same state from which they originally came. This could be their first move. Many Floridians, for example, after they retire, move to the mountains of North Carolina (Longino 1990   ), a favorite summer vacation spot for residents of the Sunshine State. Clearly they do not qualify as return migrants.There is some inferential evidence, however, from migrants' characteristics that implies that many in the counterstream are returning. Migrants in the larger streams to Sunbelt states are younger by 4–5 years, on average, than those in the counterstream (Longino 1985   ; Longino, Biggar, Flynn, and Wiseman 1984   ). This pattern would be consistent with the picture of counterstream return migrants. In addition, there is a higher proportion of women and widows in the counterstreams, a proportional gap that ranges from one quarter to one third (Longino 1985   ). By inference, therefore, one would expect to find in the counterstream women who were returning from a retirement location after being widowed. Also, consistently higher proportions (more than 20%) of those in counterstreams are not living in their own homes after their move but are living dependently with others at their destination (Longino 1985   ). So, although census data cannot separate out those who move after retirement and then return at a later date to their origin state, it seems reasonable, from indirect evidence, that such persons are surely found in the counterstreams and may even dominate some of them.As a result of these speculations from census characteristics, Litwak and Longino 1987    theorized that functional health may be one of the factors affecting migration in old age. In this context, they argued that there are three types of moves in retirement. These moves may be sequenced in the sense that the average age of movers falling into the three types would be different. Their sequencing is not meant to imply that individuals have to make any of these types of moves or make them in any particular order.The first type of move tends to come soon after retirement when economic, social, and health resources are adequate. The second follows diminished resources, such as widowhood, income inadequacy, and a decline in functional health. This move is toward relatives, particularly adult children. The third type of move is to an institution, often when family caregiving is overwhelmed by the escalating needs of the older relative. The first and third types of moves have long been documented in the research literature (Patrick 1980   ); it is the second type of move that has been most recently studied, and the one that may be most often implicated in counterstream migration.Longino, Jackson, Zimmerman, and Bradsher 1991    documented the second type of move. In doing so, they noted that some research literature in the field of geography attributes the decision to move in old age to the strength of both origin and destination place ties (Behr and Gober 1982   ; Oldakowski and Roseman 1986   ). Speare, Avery, and Lawton 1991    found two variables in the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) data set that measured place ties. These were duration of residence and homeownership, and these variables predicted residential mobility in their statistical model. Longino and colleagues 1991    likewise found that place ties were an important feature of the mix of independent variables in their model that documented health-related moves. However, the two variables used to measure place ties did little to let the researcher observe the process by which attachments influence decisions to move. These observations, ideally, would require survey data about anticipated and actual moves.It is not place ties alone, however, but also personal attachments that may motivate the second type of move, the move that occurs in the face of declining resources. Analyses of the 1990 and 1984 waves of the LSOA also lend support to these inferences from census data regarding person ties among counterstream migrants (Kovar, Fitte, and Chyba 1992   ). Among the 16% of respondents who reported making at least one move between 1984 and 1990, approximately one fifth said they moved in order to live closer to their family and another fifth said they moved because of health declines, either of themselves or of their spouses. Silverstein 1995    documented the fact that a decline in physical health of older parents increased the propensity for parents and children to become geographically more proximate to one another. Likewise, in an analysis based on the 1984–86 waves of the LSOA, Zimmerman, Jackson, Longino, and Bradsher 1993    demonstrated that declines in instrumental activities of daily living were associated with a greater likelihood of changes in residence. Further, they also reported that close proximity of a potential helper reduced the likelihood of a move. Bradsher, Longino, Jackson, and Zimmerman 1992   , using the same data set, found that the circumstance of widowhood greatly increased the probability of a move when health declines. Therefore, personal attachments either at or near the present residence, and at the place of potential destination, must be assessed.Research on declines in functional health and increased residential mobility, with the LSOA data set, has certainly contributed to an understanding of mobility in old age. However, there are two reasons why those data cannot directly address the issue of returning to one's former home after an initial retirement move. First, the sample is of older persons living in the community. It does not focus on migrants; only residential change is noted. Perhaps a quarter of persons aged more than 60 make any kind of move in a 5-year period, and fewer than 5% move across state lines (Longino 1995   ). In other words, most of the respondents in the LSOA data are not, nor will they become, interstate migrants. Second, even if it were possible to identify the few respondents making long distance moves, there is no information about the origin or destination of the move. Returning to one's former place of residence is nowhere indicated in the LSOA data. So, although they are a treasure trove of statistical models, the LSOA-based studies cannot directly answer questions about why counterstreams develop, nor why some retirees who have once moved return later to their former hometowns.In the present study we attempted to directly address, for the first time, the dynamics of the decision to make a second interstate move, one that may place the migrant into a counterstream to his or her place of residence before the original retirement move. As in other studies, we predicted that diminishing resources, such as changes in health, income, and marital status, would sometimes trigger moves, but, we also made the unique prediction that place and person ties back home and in the retirement location would tip the scales toward moving or staying.We developed logistic regression models to test this part of the life course migration theory. In these models, the outcome variable was the likelihood of an anticipated return move, and the predictor variables were diminishing resources and the place and person ties connecting the migrant to the community back home and to their retirement location. The value of this study is heuristic rather than confirmatory, because anticipated moves may not always occur. A full test of the life course model of counterstream migration awaits a longitudinal follow-up of our sample. Methods Data Collection Techniques Data were generated through in-person, structured interviews with a sample of elderly retired migrants to a metropolitan area on the east coast of Florida. The data analyzed in this article were gathered for a study of the impact of shared ethnicity on the configuration of helping networks among retired European American migrants to Florida (Stoller 1998   ). The original study limited data collection to older persons claiming European ethnicity, because the focus was on the impact of symbolic ethnicity, a voluntary label that individuals may choose to project in particular situations (Gans 1979   ). The development of this research question reflected the admonition by Markides, Liang, and Jackson 1990   (p. 112) that "the almost exclusive focus on disadvantaged ethnic groups has taught us a great deal about disadvantage at the expense of understanding how cultural factors influence behavior and identity independent of minority group status." Sample Design. For this study, we operationalized retired Sunbelt migrants as people aged 60 years and older who moved to Florida after retiring from jobs (or after their spouses retired from jobs) in the northern United States. Temporary residents ("snowbirds") who spent less than 6 months of the year in Florida were eliminated during the sample screening.The sample of Sunbelt migrants who claimed European American ethnicity was identified through telephone screening, with listings from telephone directories. European ancestry was operationalized as a positive (i.e., European) response to any of the following questions: (a) "The U.S. Census asks people to identify their ancestry. How would you answer this question?" (b) "When people ask you what your ethnic background is, what do you answer?" (c) "From what countries or parts of the world did your ancestors come?" The sample was selected in two parts, reflecting the dimensions of European American ethnicity incorporated into the original study. We identified a subsample of 205 Sunbelt migrants who claimed European American ethnicity through telephone screening, using a systematic sample with a random start of listings from telephone directories for the Florida community. In households with more than one respondent, we used a selection grid modified from a technique developed by Groves and Kahn 1979    to identify the potential respondent. An additional subsample of 394 migrants who claimed Finnish American ethnicity also completed the interviews. These Finnish Americans were identified by review of the same telephone directories by a panel of three experts familiar with the structure of Finnish names. We supplemented the Finnish American sampling frame developed from the telephone directories through membership lists of retiree organizations and through snowball sampling techniques, following techniques recommended by Kalton and Anderson 1989   . Potential respondents were selected from this frame through systematic screening with a random start. Finnish Americans identified during the initial telephone screening were added to this second subsample. The response rate for the combined sample was 78.3%. A complete description of the sample design and respondent characteristics is available elsewhere (Stoller 1998   ).Because of our interest in the anticipated probability of a return move, respondents who had already moved to assisted living environments in the Florida community were excluded from the sample for this analysis. Ultimately, the analyses reported in this article were based on data provided by 465 retired migrants (121 other European Americans and 344 Finnish Americans). Characteristics. The mean age of these respondents was 75.2 years (SD = 6.2). Of the respondents, 5.5% were aged less than 65 years, 13.8% were aged between 65 and 69, 22.8% were aged between 70 and 74, 28.9% were aged between 75 and 79, 25.9% were aged between 80 and 84 years, and 3.1% were aged 85 years and older. The majority of respondents, 56.1%, were women. Because we selected only one older person per household, the percentage of married respondents in our study is lower than the percentage of married elderly persons in the population. More than half, 55.5%, of our respondents were married, 1.5% were living with a partner, 33.8% were widowed, 5.0% were divorced or separated, and 4.1% had never married. The median level of education was 12 years; 23.6% had not graduated from high school, 36.2% were high school graduates, 22.3% reported some postsecondary education, and 17.8% had baccalaureate degrees.Almost one quarter (24.3%) of the population in the county from which the sample was drawn were 65 years of age and older. More than half (54.5%) of the county's population was married. The median level of education of the county population was also 12 years; 21.2% had not graduated from high school, 30.1% were high school graduates, 26.6% reported some secondary education, and 22.1% had baccalaureate degrees (U.S. Census Bureau 1990   ).The majority of respondents were able to manage instrumental activities of daily living without assistance. The task area with which respondents were most likely to need assistance was housework or yard work (20.1%). Fewer than 10% needed help getting to places out of walking distance (8.1%) or shopping (8.5%). Fewer than 5% needed help with cooking and fewer than 5% needed help with managing finances; dressing, bathing, or using the toilet; and getting around their house or apartment. The mean score on the Older Americans Resources and Services functional rating scale (Fillenbaum 1988   ) was 24.4 (SD = 7.9); the median score was 22, and the 25th and 75th percentiles were, respectively, 19 and 27. According to 1990 Census data, 15.5% of the county population aged 65 years and older reported a mobility or self-care limitation; 5.5% reported a mobility limitation only, 5.1% reported a self-care limitation only, and 4.9% reported both mobility and self-care limitations. Measurement Outcome Variable: Likelihood of Anticipated Counterstream Migration.—We used Cantril 1965    ladders to assess the likelihood of counterstream migration—of a return move to the "back home" community. Rungs were numbered from 0 ("absolutely would not consider moving back home") to 10 ("definitely will move back home"). Cantril ladders have the advantage of being self-anchoring and producing a theoretically interval-level measure (Palmore and Luikhart 1976   ). Frequencies for each rung are presented in  Table 1  . Only 27.6% of the respondents gave any consideration to a return move.Diminishing Resources.—Diminishing resources (the push to move) was operationalized with measures of self-assessed health, financial adequacy, and widowhood. We used a five-category ordinal measure, ranging from "excellent" to "poor," to assess health. Self-assessments of health were consistent with the relatively low levels of functional impairment reported previously: 18.2% rated their health as "excellent," 29.2% as "very good," 29.4% as "good," 18.4% as "fair," and only 4.8% as "poor."Financial adequacy was measured by a composite indicator based on responses to two items: (a) "How well does the amount of money take care of your needs?" ("very well," "fairly well," "poorly") and (b) "Do you usually have enough money to take care of those little extras?" ("yes, we can buy pretty much what we want," "yes, we can usually afford most of what we want," "sometimes, but we have to watch our budget carefully," "no, we can't afford anything extra"). We combined these items to create a six-category index: (a) money takes care of needs poorly; (b) money takes care of needs (very or fairly well) but respondent has to watch budget very carefully or cannot buy anything extra; (c) money takes care of needs fairly well and respondent can usually afford most of what he or she wants; (d) money takes care of needs fairly well and respondent can buy what he or she wants; (e) money takes care of needs very well and respondent can usually afford most of what he or she wants; (f) money takes care of needs very well and respondent can buy what he or she wants. Scores on this ordinal indicator ranged from 1 to 6, with a median score of 5; 25% of the cases scored 3 or lower, and the top 25% of the cases exhibited scores of 6.The third aspect of diminishing resources that pushed people toward counterstream migration was widowhood. Anticipation of a move back home should be lower among people who are still married than among people who have already experienced widowhood. As indicated above, 55.5% of our respondents were married and had not yet experienced widowhood.Community Ties.—Ties to the back home community were of two types: place ties and person ties. Place ties were measured by property owned back home and visits back home. Thirty-four percent of respondents still owned property back home, and 73% had visited back home within the past year. People ties were measured by the number of close relatives and friends still living back home. Children, siblings, other relatives, and close friends were counted separately; the mean number of persons in each of these relationships is presented in  Table 1  . One third (33.4%) of respondents had at least one child living back home, 31.2% had at least one living sibling back home, 19.5% had at least one close relative back home, and 25.1% identified at least one close friend living back home.Ties to the Florida retirement community were grouped into the same two categories: place ties and person ties. Place ties were measured as property ownership and duration of residence in Florida. The vast majority (93.0%) of the respondents had purchased property in Florida. Duration of residence varied from less than a year (i.e., 0 years) to 40 years. The mean number of years living in Florida was 15.3 (SD = 8.8). We also included a global measure of satisfaction with the retirement location, using a Cantril ladder with the rungs numbered from 0 ("not at all satisfied") to 10 ("extremely satisfied"). The mean satisfaction score was 8.7 (SD = 1.9). Once again, people ties were measured by proximate children, siblings, other relatives, and close friends ( Table 1  ). Slightly less than one fifth (18.1%) had at least one child living in the Florida area; 19.4% reported at least one proximate sibling, 22.7% at least one proximate other relative, and 80.6% at least one proximate close friend. Analytic Strategy Because of the skewed distribution of the outcome variable, we dichotomized the Cantril ladder assessing the likelihood of moving back home, distinguishing respondents who selected rungs below the midpoint of the scale (i.e., scores of 4 or less) from respondents who selected the midpoint or high rungs on the ladder (i.e., scores of 5 or more). The univariate distribution of this variable (see  Table 1  ) is consistent with this decision. Several logistic regression models were estimated and compared. Model 1 included diminishing resource indicators only; Model 2 included resources plus ties to the back home location; Model 3 included resources, ties back home, and ties to Florida; and Model 4 included Model 3 plus interaction terms between the diminishing resource indicators and place ties and between the diminishing resource indicators and person ties.Each interaction term was tested separately, but only significant interactions are reported here. Parameter estimates for the equations with interaction terms are available from the authors. Results for the first three models are presented in  Table 2  . Results of the regressions involving interaction terms are also available from the authors. Results Model 1 None of the resource variables (self-assessed health, marital status, or financial adequacy) had a significant impact on the likelihood of anticipated counterstream migration when considered by themselves, χ2 (3, n = 451) = 2.3, ns. Model 2 When place and person ties back home were added to the model, robustness increased considerably; for the back home block, χ2 (6, n = 451) = 32.9, p < .0001. People who made visits back home were significantly more likely to anticipate returning to their previous location to live at some time in the future. The coefficient for owning property back home was not significant in the multivariate equation. Among the person ties, both the number of children and the number of siblings back home had a significant positive impact on the probability of a return move. Controlling for ties to the back home community caused financial adequacy to reach significance. In particular, elderly persons with adequate financial resources were less likely to consider moving back home than were persons whose financial resources were more limited. Model 3 When place and person ties back home and to Florida were added to the resource model, the full picture of the main effects emerged. Incorporating indicators of ties to Florida also resulted in a significant improvement in the fit of the model; for the Florida community block, χ2 (7, n = 451) = 22.7, p < .005. Among the resource variables, only financial resources had an independent effect on anticipation of a return move back home. Elderly persons with adequate financial resources were less likely to anticipate counterstream migration than were persons who assessed their financial resources as limited. Neither self-assessed health nor marital status were significant predictors.The findings from Model 2 regarding the impact of back home ties were replicated in Model 3. That is, visits back home were an important predictor of an expected return move, although owning property back home was not. In terms of person ties, having children and siblings living back home significantly increased the odds of a respondent's anticipating a return move.The place and person ties in Florida had similar effects. Higher levels of satisfaction with life in Florida discouraged expected moves back home, although owning property in the area did not. Duration of residence in Florida did not significantly influence consideration of a return. Among person ties, only the proximity of children discouraged an anticipated return move. At least among these migrants, neither ties with kin (other than children) nor ties with friends in the retirement community had a significant impact on the anticipated likelihood of a return. Model 4 In keeping with the rationale of the second type of move embedded in the Litwak and Longino 1987    model, the resource variables in Model 1 did not become significant predictors of an expected return move until there were back home ties that made such a migration feasible. The cross-sectional design of the current study did not enable us to trace the impact of declines in resources, but the model implied that ties to the home community should be most relevant to people facing loss of resources.To explore this hypothesis, we created interaction terms between resource predictors and the back home indicators. Interaction terms involving each of the three resource variables (health, marital status, and financial resources) were entered separately. Within each set of interactions, we used a difference of chi-square test to check the overall contribution of the set of interactions. The individual significance of each interaction term was also tested. The order in which the interaction terms (or sets of interaction terms) were entered into the equation did not result in any differences in the results. Results of the tests involving interaction terms are available from the authors.None of the marital status interactions were significant, either independently or considered as a block. Adding the financial interactions to Model 3 resulted in a significant improvement in the fit of the model, but only at the .07 level of significance. This slight improvement reflected the contribution of a significant interaction between financial adequacy and visits back home. This interaction suggested that people facing financial difficulties were more likely to consider a return if they also reported visiting back home. Adding the health interactions to Model 3 also resulted in a slight improvement in the fit of the model, but only at the .06 level of significance. This slight improvement reflects a significant interaction between health and having siblings living back home. Thus, poor health increased the importance of siblings back home in decisions regarding a possible return. Discussion Our results are consistent with the second move formulation in Litwak and Longino 1987    life course model of retirement migration, that is, a move motivated by a desire to be closer to family as a person's health begins to deteriorate. Considered alone, resources such as good health, adequate financial resources, and the presence of a spouse had no direct effect on anticipation of counterstream migration. Although declines in resources can create pressure for a move back home, the potential move is considered within the context of support resources available at the time of the interviews.Our respondents were unlikely to anticipate counterstream migration unless place ties in the back home community made such a move possible. Without maintenance of ties in the community of origin, counterstream migration could not be considered going back home. Litwak and Longino 1987    concluded that, of the various types of person ties, it is only ties to children that have a significant effect upon anticipating a return move. This assertion is amply supported in Models 2 and 3. In both models, the presence of children and the presence of siblings back home significantly improved the fit of the model. Maintaining other ties in the originating location also encouraged the likelihood that elderly migrants would consider a return move. For example, elderly persons who made trips back home were more likely to consider a return move. Ties with siblings become particularly significant among persons in poor health.Support from sisters or brothers has received less attention in the family care literature than support from spouses or adult children. However, investigators have documented the exchange of both instrumental and emotional support among siblings (Cicirelli 1994   ), particularly in the absence of a spouse or geographically proximate adult child (O'Bryant 1988   ). Siblings can also be an important source of emotional support, particularly among frail older persons whose social world is contracting (Gold 1989   ). The significant interaction involving siblings may also serve as a proxy for other family characteristics that encourage a return move. A larger number of siblings back home can reflect large, extended kinship networks and/or families that have experienced little geographic mobility.Ties to the new retirement location can also discourage consideration of a return move. The availability of adult children in the Florida retirement community suppresses the anticipated likelihood of counterstream migration. This finding is also consistent with the life course model, which describes the second move as a form of kinship migration.Dissatisfaction with the Florida location also prompts thoughts of counterstream migration, and satisfaction with Florida retirement fosters greater attachment to the new location. Indeed, ties developed in the post-retirement years can make the Florida community feel more like home, particularly if ties to the community of origin diminish over time. This inverse relationship between satisfaction with the Florida community and the anticipated likelihood of a return move reflects traditional models of migration that emphasize "push" and "pull" factors (Lee 1966   ), particularly the congruence between location-specific opportunities or amenities and migrant preferences (Longino 1995   ). We would expect the fit between migrant and location to be especially important among respondents who are relatively healthy. These retirees are still enjoying the benefits of their amenity migration, the first move to Florida, and have not yet faced the declines in resources that trigger thoughts of the second move.The cross-sectional nature of the current study precludes our ability to assess the impact of declining health, inadequate financial resources, or widowhood on eventual migration decisions. Perhaps such crises will prompt actual rates of a return move considerably higher than the anticipated rates, particularly among elderly persons with few available resources. Perhaps, over time, some migrants will develop strategies for generating support within the Florida community. We will need to follow these retirees over time to discover the eventual distribution of our respondents across these two outcomes.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: Different countries have different goals for social welfare policy. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect different outcomes after certain events. This article examines changes in the economic well-being of elderly women at widowhood in the United States and Germany. Design and Methods: Longitudinal data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socioeconomic Panel were used to prepare a sample of elderly widows. Economic well-being the year before the husband's death was compared with economic well-being the year after the husband's death. Results: Although the prevalence of poverty is different in the two countries, most widows in both countries experienced a decline in living standards, and many actually fell into poverty at widowhood. A fall in Social Security and pension income was the largest contributor to the fall in living standards. Implications: The retirement income system in both countries seems to be adequate for married couples but appears to fail for widows.   Widowhood ,  Social Security ,  Economic well-being Laurence G. Branch, PhDPoverty rates among unmarried elderly women in the United States are among the highest of any demographic group. In 1997, the poverty rate for unmarried elderly women was 19% compared with a poverty rate of less than 5% for married elderly couples (see  Appendix , Note 1). Unmarried women make up almost 60% of the U.S. elderly poor while accounting for only a third of the total elderly population (National Economic Council 1998   ). One reason for the high poverty rate among elderly women in the United States is their reliance on Social Security as a sole or major source of income. Social Security was never meant to provide adequate income but rather to be a foundation to be built on with pensions and savings. On average, unmarried elderly women derive over half of their income from Social Security, and, for the poorest 40% of unmarried elderly women, Social Security accounts for over 75% of their total income (Social Security Administration 1998   ).Nevertheless, Social Security is probably the most effective antipoverty program in the United States: Poverty rates of elderly people have fallen dramatically over the past 60 years since the program began paying benefits (Smolensky, Danziger, and Gottschalk 1988   ). Social Security plays a large role in reducing both the poverty rate and the poverty gap among elderly people and disabled people (Hungerford 1996   ). However, it apparently is not as effective in preventing poverty among elderly women after the death of a spouse or divorce (Burkhauser, Duncan, and Hauser 1994   ). To reduce poverty among widows (80% of all unmarried elderly women), some have proposed that Social Security survivor benefits be increased and spouse benefits be lowered to shift income from a time of low poverty risk to a time of high poverty risk (e.g., Iams and Sandell 1998   ; Sandell and Iams 1996   ; Social Security Advisory Council 1997   ).A commonly accepted fact is that widowhood increases the likelihood of being poor. Burkhauser, Holden, and Feaster 1988   , using the Retirement History Study (RHS; see  Appendix , Note 2), found that for nonpoor older married women who eventually become widows, widowhood and a fall in nonwage income are the two events most associated with a fall into poverty. Myers, Burkhauser, and Holden 1987    and Hurd and Wise 1989   , also using the RHS, found that poverty rates of women who became widowed jumped dramatically after the deaths of their husbands. However, both studies also found a correlation between economic status before and during widowhood. Bound, Duncan, Laren, and Oleinick 1991   , using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a much wider distribution of ages, concluded that "economic status prior to widowhood is the strongest predictor of status during widowhood" (p. 115). Obviously, the commonly accepted fact is only part of the story.In this article, I examine two issues related to the death of an elderly spouse and economic well-being. The first issue deals with economic status before and after the death of a spouse: Are elderly women who are poor after becoming widows poor before? The answer to this question has important policy implications. Will policy proposals to reduce the Social Security spouse benefit and raise the survivor benefit just transfer income from one time of poverty to another time of poverty? The second issue is how the United States compares with a country that has a different philosophy toward social welfare programs. This study differs from other studies in two important respects: First, it examines living standards and income before and after the death of an elderly woman's husband. Second, it compares the United States with Germany in the 1980s and 1990s.The results show that in both the United States and Germany, most elderly women experienced a fall in living standards at widowhood, and many fell into poverty. Also in both countries, poor widows were much more likely than other widows to be poor before the deaths of their husbands. Last, a fall in Social Security and pension income was the primary contributor to the fall in income at widowhood. This article is organized as follows: The next section briefly explains the retirement income systems in the two countries. The third section describes the data used for the analysis, and the results of the analysis are presented in the section that follows. Concluding remarks are offered in the final section. Retirement Income Systems in the United States and Germany The World Bank 1994    argued that a multipillar system is necessary for income security in old age and that different pillars have different functions and should have different levels of government involvement. In the United States, these pillars are often referred to as the three legs of the retirement income stool: Social Security, pension income, and savings. Germany has a similar multipillar system for retirement income.The first pillar in both countries is Social Security, which is part of the social insurance system started in 1935 in the United States and in 1889 in Germany. There are many similarities in the Social Security systems of the two countries. Social Security coverage is mandatory and nearly universal, and both systems are paid for by workers and their employers, although the German system also receives some government subsidies. At retirement workers receive a Social Security benefit based on lifetime earnings and age, but the benefit is progressive in that workers with lower lifetime earnings receive a proportionately higher benefit than workers with higher lifetime earnings, although workers with higher lifetime earnings receive higher benefits. The German benefit tends to be much more generous than the U.S. benefit. Borsch-Supan and Schnabel 1999    reported that the German benefit replaces about 72% of preretirement net earnings of a worker with average lifetime earnings, which is substantially higher than the 53% replacement rate of the U.S. benefit for a worker with average lifetime earnings.There are also some significant differences between the two countries' systems. In the United States, the retired worker's spouse will receive a benefit based on the retired worker's earnings equal to up to 50% of the retired worker's benefit. However, if the spouse has a substantial work history, he or she will receive the higher of the spouse benefit or a retired worker benefit based on his or her own earnings and age. The German Social Security system does not pay a spouse benefit, but women with some attachment to the labor market (at least 15 years of work with 10 years after age 40) will receive a benefit based on their earnings and age (see  Appendix , Note 3). In the United States, after the death of the retired worker, the widow(er), if 60 years or older, receives a survivor's benefit equal to the retired worker's benefit (see  Appendix , Note 4). In Germany, after the death of the retired worker, the survivor, if 45 years or older, receives 100% of the deceased worker's benefit for 3 months and then 60% thereafter.Of the three pillars, Social Security is mandatory, whereas the other two pillars (pensions and savings) are voluntary. Consequently, many people rely on the first pillar as a sole source of income in old age because they were unable or unwilling to save and were not covered by a pension plan while working. Individuals in different parts of the income distribution rely on different combinations of income sources.  Table 1  shows that those elderly persons in the bottom decile of the income distribution in both countries rely primarily on Social Security for income support—about 70% of income comes from Social Security. At the other end of the distribution, Social Security is a fairly important source of income, but it is not the only source. In both countries, earnings and pension each contribute more toward income support than Social Security for those in the top decile. Data and Methods The data sources for this study are the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP). The PSID is a nationally representative longitudinal data set of the U.S. population that has been ongoing since 1968 (Hill 1992   ). The PSID interviewed a national sample of 4,800 households in 1968, and the number interviewed has grown to over 7,000 today. The replacement mechanism of the PSID for births is designed to yield a representative sample in each year.The GSOEP is a longitudinal data set started in 1984. The data are representative of the population of the western states of the reunified Germany, including "guest workers," and currently consists of over 6,000 households (Wagner, Burkhauser, and Behringer 1993   ). The PSID methodology influenced the development of the GSOEP, and the methods for following households are similar in the two samples.A 1980–1997 PSID–GSOEP equivalent file is available (Burkhauser, Butrica, and Daly 1995   ). The file contains equivalently defined variables (to the extent possible) on income, employment, and demographic information from the PSID and the GSOEP. Also included are annual price indices for the two countries and median household annual income. The PSID data contain information on over 7,000 households for the years 1980–1997. The GSOEP file contains data on over 5,000 households for the years 1984–1997.The income measure used in the study was posttransfer, pretax income. There were several reasons for choosing this measure. First, it is the income measure used in the United States for official poverty statistics and is used by most researchers in poverty research. Second, tax information is not available in the PSID file after 1991; thus, almost half of the sample would be unusable. Third, taxes in each data set are calculated on the basis of household characteristics rather than actual taxes paid by the household. Fourth, if taxes were subtracted from income, not only would income be lower but so too would the poverty thresholds (see  Appendix , Note 5). Household income is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household (household size and ages of household members), using the detailed official U.S. equivalence weight (see  Appendix , Note 6). People are ranked on basis of the income of the household they live in adjusted for household size and composition (see  Appendix , Note 7).The concept of poverty is different in the two countries (Germany does not have an official poverty threshold), consequently a comparable measure of poverty needed to be developed. I use two different thresholds in this article, but both are based on median household income. The first is 35% of median equivalence-adjusted household income (denoted POVLIN35); the second is 45% of median equivalence- adjusted household income (denoted POVLIN45). Median income is determined for the entire PSID and GSOEP samples for each year. I chose a relative poverty threshold because an absolute measure (updated for inflation) would fall further behind living standards (measured by median income) during economic expansions. A relative measure has a fixed relationship to the standard of living, and changes in the standard of living of elderly widows are the main focus of this article. In the United States, it should be noted, the poverty rate, using a relative threshold, is generally higher than the official poverty rate (Danziger, Haveman, and Plotnick 1986   ). For the United States, POVLIN35 yielded about the same level of poverty as the official U.S. measure when averaged over several years but did not track year-to-year changes. This is because income and prices grow at different rates. POVLIN45 yielded a higher poverty rate on average and in all years. This measure yielded poverty rates that were 42% (United States) and 75% (Germany) greater than the 35% measure. I used POVLIN45 because many researchers and policymakers (including myself) believe that the U.S. official poverty threshold is too low. Burkhauser and colleagues 1995    provided a more detailed discussion of the differences between the United States and Germany regarding poverty.The sample used in this study included all women 58 years of age or older who were initially married and living with their husbands, who were living in a family receiving Social Security or pension income, and who were eventually widowed. Three years of data were used in the study: Year t is the year of the husband's death, Year t − 1 is the year before widowhood (i.e., the women were married), and Year t + 1 is the year after the husband's death occurred. Only Years t − 1 and t + 1 were compared because the data files did not record when during the interview year (Year t) the death occurred. Furthermore, income in the year of widowhood (Year t) may not be comparable to the years before or after because lump-sum death benefits (e.g., life insurance) are often paid to widows and may temporarily increase income. The final sample used contained data on 177 women in Germany (see  Appendix , Note 8) and 259 women in the United States. Household weights were used throughout the analysis. Table 2  reports some descriptive information on the women in the sample. The age distribution in Period t − 1 was similar in the two samples: The mean in both was about 71 years, and the range was from 58 years to the late 80s. All women were 60 years or older in Year t + 1 and were therefore eligible to receive survivor benefits in both countries. Over 50% of the women in the German sample and 39% in the U.S. sample had less than a high school education. Another major difference between the two samples was that 22% of the women in the U.S. sample had education past high school, and only 1% of women in the German sample had education past high school. Part of this could be due to institutional differences in educational systems in the two countries (see  Appendix , Note 9). Average household sizes in Period t − 1 and in Period t + 1 in the two countries were roughly the same.The method used in this article was a tabular analysis of poverty and income dynamics. The poverty measures examined were the poverty rate and the average poverty gap. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty threshold and household income if the difference is positive and is equal to zero otherwise. The income measures were income changes and mobility within the income distribution. When examining income mobility, mobility refers to movement within the distribution of the entire sample of households, not just the sample of elderly widows. Hypothesis tests were conducted for either Period t − 1 to t + 1 changes in each measure or for U.S.–German differences in these measures. Poverty Dynamics Poverty dynamics in the two countries were sensitive to the poverty threshold used. Results for both the 35% (POVLIN35) and 45% (POVLIN45) thresholds are presented and discussed.  Table 3  shows the poverty rate and poverty gap for Periods t − 1 and t + 1 in both countries. The hypothesis tested was whether the Period t − 1 and the Period t + 1 measures were equal. The first half of the table presents the results using POVLIN35, and the second half presents the results using POVLIN45.The period t − 1 poverty rate for these women in the United States was 12% and increased by 10 percentage points (almost doubling) to 22% in the year after widowhood. This increase in poverty is statistically significant at the 1% level. The average poverty gap tripled from $221 to $679 in the United States between Period t − 1 and Period t + 1. When examining just widows who were poor in Period t + 1, two points are worth emphasizing. First, the Period t − 1 average poverty gap of t + 1 poor widows was much larger than the average poverty gap of the whole sample (200% larger in the United States)—Period t + 1 poor widows started out in Period t − 1 (when married) much poorer than most widows. Second, the increase in the average poverty gap between Periods t − 1 and t + 1 was particularly startling—350% in the United States (this increase was statistically significant at the 1% level). In contrast, the poverty rate in Germany started out in Period t − 1 at just 3% and increased by 5.7 percentage points, or tripled, in Period t + 1. The increase in poverty gap in Germany at widowhood, however, was just as startling as the increase in the United States.The second half of  Table 3  presents the poverty results using POVLIN45 as the threshold. The overall Period t − 1 to Period t + 1 dynamics in both countries were pretty much the same, although the starting poverty rates and poverty gaps were much higher in both countries. The results in the halves of  Table 3  suggest that in both the United States and Germany poor widows started out from a more disadvantaged position than nonpoor widows and become much poorer after the deaths of their husbands, although there was a smaller proportion of poor widows in Germany.The next table,  Table 4  , shows the distribution of income in relation to the poverty threshold. The columns in this table show the Period t − 1 and t + 1 distributions for the entire sample in both countries, plus the distribution in Period t − 1 of those widows who were poor in Period t + 1 (labeled t + 1 poor in t − 1). The first half of the table shows the results when using POVLIN35 as the poverty threshold. The Period t − 1 columns (a) reiterate the poverty rate results shown in  Table 3  and (b) show that most women who became widows were not concentrated just above the poverty threshold. Consequently, it was not just small changes in income that pushed many of these widows into poverty. Over half of these widows in the United States lived in households with income over double the poverty threshold. In addition, 17% of Period t + 1 poor widows started out in Period t − 1 in households with income over twice the poverty threshold. The column for Period t + 1 shows that the distribution generally shifted down toward the poverty threshold, but still nearly half of the widows had income that was at least twice the poverty threshold. The overall pattern in Germany was not that much different than that in the United States.As would be expected, with the POVLIN45 threshold poverty appeared to be much more persistent—a higher proportion of Period t + 1 poor widows were poor or near poor in Period t − 1 (see bottom half of  Table 4  ). In Period t − 1, more U.S. women were concentrated near the poverty threshold, and more women were below the poverty threshold. Fewer than half of the women had income above 200% of the poverty threshold. The results were even more striking for the Period t + 1 poor widows: over 40% were poor in Period t − 1, and another 20% were near poor (i.e., 100% to 125% of the poverty threshold) in the United States. In Germany, many of the same qualitative results are evident. In addition, 28% of Period t + 1 poor widows were poor in Period t − 1, 24% were near poor, and an additional 27% were at 125%–150% of the poverty threshold.Poverty transitions between Period t − 1 and Period t + 1 are shown in  Table 5  . When POVLIN35 was used (top half), three quarters of the women in the U.S. sample were not poor in both Periods t − 1 and t + 1 compared with 90% of the women in the German sample (the U.S.–German difference was statistically significant at the 1% level). Slightly less than 10% in the United States and less than 3% in Germany were poor in both periods (again, the U.S.–German difference was statistically significant at the 1% level). Even though a very small minority in each country were always poor, it turns out that in the United States 40% of Period t + 1 poor widows were poor before widowhood in contrast to 29% of Period t + 1 poor German widows. The results were qualitatively similar when POVLIN45 was used (bottom half of  Table 5  ). Income Dynamics The results on poverty dynamics in the previous section show the proportion of elderly widows who moved above or below a particular threshold. However, these results do not provide much information on how living standards changed more generally.  Table 6  shows how income changed for these women between Periods t − 1 and t + 1. The top two rows show the median equivalent real household income (in 1991 currency units) for these women in Periods t − 1 and t + 1. Median real income decreased slightly in both countries. On the basis of these median values, one might conclude that widowhood brings a small change in living standards. The results from the previous section show that this conclusion is certainly not valid for some widows (i.e., poor widows); however, is this conclusion valid for most widows? The next rows in  Table 6  show that the median fall in equivalent real income after the husband's death was 16%, and about two thirds of the widows experienced a fall in equivalent real income in the United States. Almost 60% experienced a 10% or greater fall in income, and almost 25% of these women experienced a 10% or more increase in equivalent real income after the deaths of their husbands. Although a similar proportion of German widows experienced a fall in income after widowhood, the fall was not nearly as large as that of U.S. widows (the median decrease was 9%).Although  Table 6  shows how income changed, it does not show which income changed. Elderly couples and widows receive income from several sources, all of which can change over time or after certain events such as widowhood. For  Table 7  , each sample (U.S. and German) was split into three groups, based on the percentage of change in equivalent real household income (labeled %ΔInc in the table) between Periods t − 1 and t + 1. Average income from each source for each group was then calculated for Period t − 1 and Period t + 1.For the U.S. widows who experienced a large decline in income (at least a 10% fall; see  Appendix , Note 10), the largest absolute change in income was retirement income (Social Security plus other income; see  Appendix , Notes 11 and 12), accounting for about 44% of the total decrease in income. After retirement income (Social Security and pension income), a fall in labor income was the second largest absolute change. Most of the Period t − 1 labor income for these women was earned by the husbands—about 20% (most in part-time jobs) of the U.S. sample worked in Period t − 1 (see  Appendix , Note 13). The loss of the main breadwinner and a fall in Social Security and pension income accounted for the lower living standards of many widows. Together, the change in labor income, Social Security income, and other income accounted for 73% of the fall in income in the United States. In Germany, the fall in retirement income (i.e., Social Security) and labor income accounted for 94% of the fall in total income. Either the retirement income system (Social Security and pensions) is failing a substantial number of widows in each country, or many families are not adequately preparing for retirement in both countries.The next group of widows was women experiencing either a small decrease or a small increase (±10%) in income. Generally, in both countries the change in each component of total income was fairly small, and only one of the t − 1/t + 1 differences (Social Security income in Germany) approached statistical significance (at the 10% level). The final group is the women who experienced a large (i.e., more than 10%) increase in real equivalent household income at widowhood. Again, there were few differences between the two countries. The single largest increase in income was in asset income (see  Appendix , Note 14). There are two possible reasons for the large increase in this component of total household income. The first source could be the annuitization of a large life insurance distribution. The second source could be an increase in the imputed rental value (equivalent) of owner-occupied housing, as ownership of this asset is generally transferred to the widow (see  Appendix , Note 15).Next, I examine how widowhood affects a woman's position in the income distribution.  Table 8  shows the distribution of movement within the income distribution (quintile movement) between Periods t − 1 and t + 1 (see  Appendix , Note 16). In both countries, about 50% of widows lived in households in the poorest two income quintiles before they became widows (see  Appendix ,  Table 1  A and  Table 2A  ). Furthermore, of the widows who started in the poorest two quintiles in Period t − 1, the vast majority (86% in the United States and 73% in Germany) remained in the poorest two quintiles in Period t + 1. Many widows were in the poorest 40% of the population before their husbands' deaths, and most remained there afterward. Very few women actually moved up in the income distribution (15% in the United States and 27% in Germany). The proportions for quintile mobility in  Table 8  were based on the number of women who could potentially move the number of quintiles indicated. For example, the proportion who moved up two or more quintiles were those women who started out in the bottom three quintiles of the income distribution. In both countries, almost 45% of the widows did not change their quintile position in the income distribution. Roughly the same proportion of widows moved down one quintile in both the United States and Germany (35% and 30%, respectively). A larger proportion moved down two or more quintiles in the United States than in Germany, and the difference was statistically significant at the 1% level. Interestingly, 25% of the women who could move two or more quintiles did move two or more quintiles in Germany, compared with only 5% in the United States. Concluding Remarks Widowhood, in both the United States and Germany, is a time of loss. Widows have lost not only their husbands but also, for many, their standard of living. Many American and German women become poor at widowhood, and many American women are poor before widowhood and then become even poorer after the loss of their husbands. In Germany, women are two to three times more likely to be in poverty after the deaths of their husbands than when they were married. In the United States, women who become widows are less than twice as likely to fall into poverty after the deaths of their husbands. In addition, many poor widows were poor before the deaths of their husbands. It must be emphasized, however, that the poverty rate for elderly widows in the United States was more than double the rate in Germany.Most widows in the United States and Germany experienced a fall in real income after the deaths of their husbands. A fall in Social Security and pension income was the largest contributor to the fall in total income in both countries, and the loss of the husband's labor income was the second largest contributor. But not all widows were worse off financially after the deaths of their husbands; one in four widows actually experienced a large rise in income (i.e., by over 10%), mostly due to an increase in asset income.The German retirement income system appears much more effective than the U.S. system in keeping retired married couples out of poverty because Social Security benefits are more generous (taxes are also higher, though). However, both the U.S. and German systems are much less successful in maintaining the living standards of women who become widows. These results suggest that proposals in the United States to reduce the spouse benefit and increase the survivor benefit would, for many, just transfer income from a time of poverty to another time of poverty (see  Appendix , Note 17). A policy to increase survivor benefits only or to increase means-tested benefits could be effective in maintaining the living standards of elderly widows, but program costs would necessarily increase. Notes This 19% poverty rate is just slightly lower than the 20% poverty rate for children under 18 years.The RHS sample consists of women married to men born between 1905 and 1911.Borsch-Supan and Schnabel 1999    noted that most wives receive their own benefits.This assumes the widow(er) is not eligible for a higher Social Security benefit on the basis of his or her earnings record.The poverty threshold is based on median income. Incorporating taxes would change the income distribution since taxes are progressive. The calculated poverty threshold would be lower; consequently, the poverty rates in both countries would also be lower. Taxes are more progressive in Germany than in the United States. However, based on a limited analysis with the reduced data set the qualitative results hold if taxes are incorporated, but in many instances cell sizes are very small.This equivalence weight is based on the official poverty threshold in the United States and accounts for economies of scale by adjusting for both the size and the composition of the family.An implicit assumption is that income is freely shared among household members.No German guest workers were included in the sample because they are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits.Burkhauser and colleagues 1995    reported that the education variables are not entirely comparable between the two countries.This group accounted for almost 60% of the widows in the United States and almost 50% of the widows in Germany (see  Table 6  ).From the income variable calculation appendix in the codebook (Butrica & Jurkat, n.d.), Social Security income in Germany included income from Social Security pensions plus income from employer or occupational old-age pensions. In the U.S. sample, Social Security income included only income from the Social Security Administration.Other income in the United States included employer pension income as well as transfers from persons outside of the household. In the German sample, other income included only transfers from persons outside of the household.Of the households where women worked in Period t − 1, their labor income accounted for 43% of total household labor income in the United States.Asset income included income from assets plus the imputed rental value of owner-occupied housing. The imputed rental value of owner-occupied housing captures a cost that homeowners do not incur and was considered as income.The imputed rental of owner-occupied housing most likely remains constant over Periods t − 1 to t + 1, but the equivalence factor becomes smaller after the husband's death. Consequently, the equivalent value of this income source will increase after the husband's death.The transition matrices for both the United States and Germany are shown in Appendix  Table 1  A and 2A. Income quintiles are defined for all households and are based on equivalent household income. Consequently, the rows and columns in Appendix  Table 1  A and  Table 2A  do not necessarily have to sum to 20%.It can also be argued that for families with high discount rates a transfer of income (inflation adjusted) to the future would make the family worse off.

     Abstract This study examined the complexities of age relations at work. Garment workers believed that their fate was linked to ageism and that their work experience was discounted by management. Managers wanted to be rid of older workers because they commanded higher wages than younger workers. The issue was cost reduction, and age was implicated unintendedly. Still, managers seemed to use stereotypical images to discourage older workers and they did not organize work routines to facilitate the adaptation of them. Instead, they subcontracted the easy jobs, relying on the experience of the older employees for difficult work while not adapting the workplace. Theoretically, the authors argue that ageism and age discrimination can best be understood through a recognition of the importance of structured age relations and human agency.   Age discrimination ,  Inequality ,  Gender ,  Class ,  Ethnicity Laurence G. Branch, PhDIn response to the widespread recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s and the simultaneous increase in global trade and competition, many firms developed restructuring strategies that were aimed at reducing "excessive" labor costs (Harrison 1994   ; Menzies 1996   ; Rifkin 1995   ). The specific strategies used depended on the characteristics of the industry or firm. Some organizations moved their production plants from Canada or the United States to countries, such as Mexico or Brazil, where labor costs are lower (Hardy, Hazelrigg, and Quadagno 1996   ; Leach and Winson 1995   ). Others declared bankruptcy and then opened a few months later under a different name and with a nonunionized, less expensive labor force (Marshall 1997   ; McMullin 1996   ). Still others have used early retirement incentives or attractive severance packages as a means of eliminating the "dead wood" within a firm (Hardy et al. 1996   ). Regardless of the particular business strategy, rightsizing, downsizing, and restructuring are the buzz words used to signify the elimination of jobs and the termination of workers in a company's quest to become more competitive and profitable within the context of contemporary capitalism. These words have translated into loss of employment for thousands of people in Canada and the United States (Advisory Group on Working Time and the Distribution of Work 1994   ).Moore provided some indication of the magnitude of job displacement in the United States, estimating that "roughly two to three million people were displaced each year from 1982 to 1991" (Moore 1996   , p. 20). The volume of, and reasons for, displacement varied by changes in the business cycle, with displacement increasing during recessionary periods. However, many firms use recessionary layoffs as a means to downsize their workforce. Indicators of social class (e.g., occupation, education, wage level), as well as industry, gender, race, and age are among the factors that are associated with the likelihood of job displacement (Couch 1998   ; Gardner 1993   ; Herz 1990   ; Kinsella and Gist 1995   ; Kletzer 1991   ; Lauzon 1995   ). Persons in lower social classes are generally at a greater risk of job displacement than are those in higher social classes, and workers in goods-producing industries tend to be at greater risk of job displacement than those in other industries (Gardner 1993   ; Herz 1990   ; Lauzon 1995   ). Men are more likely than women to be displaced from their jobs, and in the United States Black and Hispanic workers are at a greater risk of job displacement than are White workers (Gardner 1993   ; Herz 1990   ; Kletzer 1991   ). Finally, younger and older workers are more likely to be displaced than are workers in the middle age groups (Gardner 1993   , Gardner 1995   ; Lauzon 1995   ).Among these factors, age is perhaps the most understudied dimension of inequality within sociology in general, and within the subfield of work and occupations in particular. Very little is known about the role that age plays in disadvantaging certain groups of people relative to others within labor markets. In fact, whereas youth unemployment has emerged as a policy and research issue over the last decade, older displaced workers tend to be overlooked (Couch 1998   ; LeBlanc and McMullin 1997   ). This remains true even though unemployment rates among older workers increased between 1980 and 1990 in most industrialized countries and the unemployment rates among male workers aged 55 to 59 were higher than the unemployment rates among male workers aged 25 to 54 (Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the United States are exceptions here; Gardner 1995   ; Kinsella and Gist 1995   ; Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development 1995   ; Schellenberg 1994   ). Further, older workers have longer durations of unemployment (approximately 20 weeks among men and 15 weeks among women in the United States) than younger workers (approximately 15 weeks among men and 10 weeks among women in the United States; Kinsella and Gist 1995   ; Love and Torrence 1989   ) and tend to be overrepresented among discouraged workers (in the United States, older male workers represent 8% of economically active men and 28% of discouraged male workers; older female workers represent 7% of economically active women and 21% of discouraged female workers) (Kinsella and Gist 1995   ). Further, if and when older, unemployed workers find a job, their reemployment earnings are less (Love and Torrence 1989   ).Employment and displacement statistics shed little light on the circumstances of the workers themselves or on their perceptions of job loss. Further, age patterns in job displacement are often interpreted as cohort effects. Researchers have suggested that older workers are at a greater risk of job displacement when compared with middle-aged workers because as a group they are less educated and are disproportionately employed in industries that have been the hardest hit by restructuring. Although cohort effects are important, other factors such as ageism may contribute to later-life job displacement and to other detrimental aspects of older workers' lives. In this article we address the role that ageism plays in garment industry work and displacement. Before turning to the data, we consider what ageism is and how it might be conceptualized. What is Ageism? Although ageism can refer to "any prejudice or discrimination against or in favor of an age group" (Palmore 1990   , p.15), the term has generally been used to denote systematic negative stereotyping of and discrimination against older people simply because they are old (Butler 1969   ; Vincent 1995   ). Ageism frequently rests on a conceptualization of age in chronological years and is thus defined as "the attribution of characteristics, abilities, limitations or events to the mere passing of time" (Bodily 1991   , p. 258). Age-ism involves beliefs (e.g., old people are ugly, sickly, and unproductive) and attitudes (e.g., general preferences for youth and being young rather than old) that often translate into discriminatory action (Bytheway 1995   ; Palmore 1990   ). Ageist beliefs and attitudes may not, in and of themselves, be harmful. However, age discrimination occurs if these beliefs and attitudes legitimate "the use of chronological age to mark out classes of people who are systematically denied resources and opportunities that others enjoy, and who suffer the consequences of such denigration, ranging from well-meaning patronage to unambiguous vilification" (Bytheway 1995   , p.14). Thus, there are two interconnected dimensions of ageism: an ageist ideology, which includes negative stereotypes, beliefs, and attitudes, and age discrimination, which is behavior that excludes certain people and places them in a disadvantaged situation relative to others on the basis of their chronological age.In Western societies, ageism occurs within families and households, government agencies, health care systems, and waged labor markets (Laws 1995   ; Palmore 1990   ). Many government regulations and programs are established or interpreted with a particular age group in mind and thus inadvertently discriminate against persons in other age groups (Laws 1995   ; LeBlanc and McMullin 1997   ; Palmore 1990   ). Job retraining programs are a good example of this type of discrimination because they are generally targeted toward people of "employable" ages or of specific gender, racial, or disability statuses (LeBlanc and McMullin 1997   ).In this article we focus on ageism that occurs within the context of waged labor markets (Laws 1995   ; Palmore 1990   ), one example of which is the practice of mandatory retirement. Although mandatory retirement is prohibited in the United States by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), certain occupations (e.g., airline pilots) are exempt from this legislation. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that individuals are equal under the law without discrimination on the basis of age, but only three provinces have legislation prohibiting age discrimination, making mandatory retirement an acceptable practice in the other provinces (McPherson 1998   ). Hence, mandatory retirement policy is one example of age discrimination, whereby people are disadvantaged on the basis of chronological age rather than ability.Beyond these mandatory retirement issues, some evidence suggests that age discrimination in employment may be relatively widespread. Between 1967 (when the ADEA was enacted) and 1983, millions of dollars in compensation were awarded to thousands of Americans for age discrimination in employment (Atchley 1988   ). National surveys conducted in the United States in the 1980s suggested that 80% of Americans in general and 61% of employers in particular believe that "most employers discriminate against older people and make it difficult for them to find work" (Atchley 1988   , p. 268). Similarly, a recent Canadian survey of counselors in government unemployment offices across the country found that 84% moderately or strongly agree that "employers discriminate against older workers in hiring practices" (Underhill, Marshall, and Deliencourt 1997   , p. 3). Further, older workers may be overlooked for promotions or fired, simply on the basis of their age (Falk and Falk 1997   ; Palmore 1990   ; Rodeheaver 1992   ).Very little research has examined the extent or nature of ageism within the workplace and research that has done so often has located the problem at an individual level; individuals are held to discriminate against others because they hold prejudicial attitudes and stereotypes about them. But, as the following section shows, ageism is not fully determined by ideologies and their component stereotypes and attitudes. Rather, social structural issues influence and shape ageism within many contexts, including that of paid work. Rethinking Ageism: Structured Age Relations and Waged Labor Markets There is little doubt that ageist beliefs, held by individuals, play a role in determining the nature of ageism within waged labor markets. However, as with sexism and racism there is likely a significant structural component to ageism that is not captured by ideology alone. Two approaches to this issue have informed our analysis. The first approach is from Laws 1995   , who, from a postmodernist perspective, moved toward a discussion of ageist structures by discussing ageism in relation to oppression and power relations. Drawing on the work of Young 1990   , Laws argued that oppressed older people are subject to marginalization, violence, powerlessness, exploitation, and cultural imperialism, all historically and geographically situated or grounded in sites of ageism such as families and households, government agencies, health care systems, and waged labor markets.Throughout her analysis, Laws placed emphasis on the conceptualization of "age as a social relation, one dimension of a complex set of relations between people" (Laws 1995   , p. 112). According to Laws, age relations structure ageism that "like racism and sexism, is a form of prejudice, a form of oppression that not only limits people who are the object of that oppression but which also shapes perceptions of people, both young and old, who hold ageist attitudes" (Laws 1995   , p. 113). Regarding ageism in waged labor markets, Laws noted that later life labor force exit has defined old age at an ideological level, which produces and reproduces the institution of retirement. She discussed ageism as the marginalization and powerlessness that older and retired workers experience and as the material losses that these workers face in retirement.In the literature on aging and social inequality, political economy theorists have located social structure at the heart of their analyses, and this approach is the second upon which our analysis rests. Political economy theorists have explained the relative situation of older individuals by focusing on the interrelationship between the economy, the polity, and the ideological structures that these systems of domination construct and reconstruct. In this approach, age discrimination (behavior) is not viewed as a simple consequence of ageist ideology (attitudes based on negative stereotypes). Nor are ageist attitudes or age discriminatory policies seen as direct results of an inability of the individual to adjust to aging, naturally diminishing physical or mental capacities. Rather, political economists have attributed age discrimination to the structural characteristics of the state, the economy, and inequalities in the distribution and allocation of resources that these institutions create (Estes 1979   , Estes 1991   ; Guillemard 1983   ; Myles 1984   , Myles 1989   ; Phillipson 1982   , Phillipson 1998   ; Townsend 1981   , Townsend 1986   ; Walker 1981   ). Ageism may be a consequence of, or provide a legitimating ideological foundation for, discriminatory age patterns.The social construction of age as an organizing feature of social life is recognized in the political economy approach, and structural factors that limit the opportunities of older adults are at the core of these analyses. However, the approach tends to reduce the analysis of ageism and social inequality in later life to issues of social class. Like Marx (1967; Marx & Engels, 1970), political economy of aging researchers have emphasized the relations of production in their conceptualization of social class, because these relations structure behavior and privilege between those who own the means of production and those who do not (Guillemard 1982   , Guillemard 1983   ; Myles 1984   , Myles 1989   ; Phillipson 1982   ; Townsend 1981   ; Walker 1981   ). Missing in most political economy accounts is an analysis of the relationship between age relations and class relations as they structure social inequality at various life course stages. And, as others have pointed out (Kohli 1988   ; Marshall and Tindale 1978   –79), the economic and social locations of older people reflect not only class inequalities in early life but also unique processes that are structured by age relations as well.The preceding review highlights the importance of the relationship among social structure and ageism as it is identified in both the political economy approach and Law's work. In this article, we explore this relationship further by focusing specifically on structured age relations. Although the term age relations is used sparingly within the gerontological literature, it has not been developed through a critical lens, as a concept that refers to a structural dimension of social life. We believe that it is important to consider the structural nature of age relations in their own right, and the ways in which they intersect with other sets of structured social relations such as class, gender, and ethnic/race relations.In our view, social relations (such as age, class, gender, and ethnic/race relations) are fundamental elements of the social structure that produce enduring, orderly, and patterned social systems. Structured social relations are based on the varied rights and privileges that define social relationships (see Wright 1999   , for a discussion of this point with respect to social class). Hence, a relational understanding of age requires an emphasis on "structured forms of power, organization, direction, and regulation that exist in modern societies and through which ruling groups maintain and reproduce their dominant positions" (Layder 1994   , p. 159; see also Smith 1987   ). By taking age relations into account in assessments of waged labor markets, we are suggesting that age is implicated in productive social relations.In our analysis, we have made three related assumptions about social life: first, that social roles, normative expectations, socialization processes, and role sanctions are grounded in structured social relations that are characterized more by conflict than by consensus; second, that, social structure does not stand outside of the human, social behavior that produces it, yet it nevertheless takes on properties that transcend the behavior of those who construct it; and third, although these properties of durability constrain and limit the agency of the individual, they never do so completely (for more detail on this theoretical approach, see McMullin and Marshall 1999   ).With this as our theoretical backdrop, we now turn to our case study of garment workers in Montreal to explore whether ideological (i.e., attitudes, beliefs, values) and/or behavioral (i.e., discrimination) dimensions of ageism are at play within these workers' lives. To do so we first assess whether garment workers discussed their labor market experiences by offering explanations about them that relied on ageist attitudes, beliefs, or values. Second, we explore whether older garment workers believed that they had been excluded or eliminated from employment opportunities because of their age. After presenting our analyses, we conclude by discussing how these ideological and behavioral dimensions of ageism can be explained theoretically by drawing on the intersection of structured age relations and individual actions. Methods Sample We used data from a case study of the Montreal Garment Industry, one of seven case studies in different industrial sectors conducted under the direction of the second author as part of a project called Issues of an Aging Workforce: A Study to Inform Human Resources Policy Development (IAW). In this case study, researchers collected archival data and conducted key informant interviews; focus group discussions with employed, retired, and displaced garment workers; and industry representative surveys. We chose this case study because, unlike the other case studies, the data from the Montreal garment industry provided information from retired and displaced workers, as well as current employees. This allowed us to analyze perceptions of ageism among current as well as displaced and retired workers, which was not possible using data from the other case studies.The analysis relied primarily on the focus group discussions (see Morgan 1993   , for a discussion of this methodology). Researchers can use focus group data in two ways: as documentary evidence to construct a case study of the firm or industry under study or as evidence about the individual providing the data. For example, these discussions could help us to understand general conditions, such as age and gender discrimination in a firm, as perceived by respondents; but the individual account that is given in a focus group could also be taken to characterize the experiences and perspectives of the person who rendered that account.Access to the garment industry in Montreal was facilitated through contacts with the Council of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (now called UNITE) and by the Quebec Fashion Apparel Manufacturers' Guild. Because of these Union and Guild links our sample comprised the most "privileged" garment workers, who work in unionized shops. Between May 1994 and March 1995, 12 focus group discussions were conducted in Montreal, two with retired workers, three with displaced workers, and seven with employed workers. The focus group discussions were relatively unstructured. However, the focus group mediator followed a list of guidelines developed by the IAW research team and always asked several questions relating to the key themes of the project—career mobility, health, retirement, technology, and family.The focus groups ranged in size from 4 to 10 people, with a total of 79 individuals taking part in the study. Five of the focus groups comprised employees who worked together in five different shops. Two of these shops were relatively large by industry standards, employing between 80 and 100 people. Two of the shops were of average size (about 50 people) and one was small (about 20 people). These discussions were held on work time and the IAW project paid these employees for their time away from their jobs. Participants either volunteered to participate in a focus group at the request of the shop's union official or the union official chose who would participate. In the other two employee focus groups, union officials asked workers who were not necessarily employed at the same shop to participate in the IAW study. These focus groups were held at the union headquarters outside of normal working hours.The retiree focus groups comprised members of the union's retiree club. The retirees met every Thursday at the union headquarters to participate in activities such as playing cards, and the IAW focus groups were planned as one of these activities. Those who chose not to participate carried on (in another room) with their regular Thursday activities. The IAW project contacted displaced workers through the union as well. Again, a union official asked for volunteers among employees who were currently looking for work. To preserve anonymity and confidentiality, focus group participants and the garment shops are referred to by pseudonyms, chosen to reflect the ethnicity of the participants (Snell 1993   ).The involvement of union officials in selecting our sample of garment workers created a potential bias because these workers may have been chosen because they were particularly sensitive to union issues. This would be problematic if the aim of the research was to illustrate trends and rates and to generalize these findings to other populations. However, our intent was to use a qualitative methodology to document the processes and mechanisms through which ageism might occur. Thus, for our purposes, a heightened level of consciousness regarding union issues may have been beneficial. A second, and potentially more harmful bias, is that our study was based only on privileged, unionized workers or former unionized workers. More research is needed to determine if the processes and mechanisms of ageism are applicable to more marginalized workers within this industry. Sample Characteristics  Table 1  shows the sample characteristics. We make no claim that our sample was representative of the garment industry as a whole. However, the sample did reflect industry trends in the distribution of gender and occupation (the only variables in  Table 1  for which there is accurate industry data). The percentage of women in our sample was somewhat higher than in the Quebec garment industry (96% vs 82%, see the Results section for a discussion of gender composition of the industry) but nonetheless reflected the fact that the majority of workers in this industry are women. It is unclear why a disproportionate number of women chose to participate in this study. Fifty-eight percent of these respondents were married, and three quarters were parents. Sixty-six percent of them were or had been sewing machine operators (compared with 69% of women in the Quebec garment industry). Fifty-one percent of the participants were employed, 18% were retired, and 32% were displaced. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents reported French as their mother tongue, and the same percentage reported that Canada was their birth country. Forty-one percent stated their mother tongue as Italian, and 38% said they were born in Italy. Much smaller percentages reported other mother tongues and birth countries.We did not specifically ask respondents about their income or education, in part because industry averages suggest that the majority of these workers are poorly paid and have low levels of education. For instance, whereas 71% of the Canadian workforce has at least a secondary school diploma, this compares to only 44% of the workers in the Canadian garment industry. Regarding income, the average hourly wage for unionized male workers in Quebec's garment industry is $11.89 CA and for unionized female workers it is $9.22 CA.As part of the research design, older workers (aged 45 and older) were specifically targeted for participation in this study. Respondents were not systematically asked how old they were and hence precise age breakdowns could not be generated. In the analysis of the qualitative data, the age of the respondent was indicated if known and reported as unknown otherwise. Notably, most of the respondents who were not questioned about their age were in the displaced and retired focus groups, and these people were most likely older than 50.These sample characteristics paint a picture of garment workers in the Quebec industry and in our study. It is a picture that is well known in the industry and one that is perhaps best described by one of our key informants, Daniel Dubuc, director of the Ladies' Clothing Joint Commission, an organization that comprises both guild members and union representatives. He said the following in describing a typical garment worker:She is a woman, not well educated I'm afraid. Very stubborn, with courage, she is an immigrant, she is in her forties, she has backaches, and she has industrial handicaps. Analysis The analysis was conducted in two stages whereby the data were first physically organized into theme areas and then organized into analytically meaningful categories (Knodel 1993   ). In the first, mechanical stage of the analysis, segments of text were coded into theme areas that were driven by the IAW project—family, career, retirement, technology and training, and health. The data in each of these theme areas were coded a second time for cross-referencing purposes.The second, more explicitly interpretive, stage of the analysis involved establishing criteria for organizing the data into analytically meaningful subdivisions and then searching for patterns within and between these subdivisions (Knodel 1993   ). This process involved searching for expected subthemes (e.g., ageist attitudes) and identifying subthemes that were less expected (e.g., the impact of bankruptcy laws and factory closures on the relations of production).For the specific purposes of this study, the career, retirement, and technology and training theme areas were coded into subtheme areas that dealt specifically with ageism. Comments that were made in the focus groups about age were coded according to whether they reflected negative experiences, attitudes, beliefs, or values about older people or aging. We coded any instance in which focus groups discussed their work/displacement/retirement experiences by offering explanations about them that relied on ageist attitudes, beliefs, or values into a general category that we referred to as ideological ageism. Next, we coded work/displacement/retirement experiences that excluded or eliminated older workers from employment opportunities into a second category that we referred to as age discrimination.Notably, we relied on the perceptions of the workers themselves as evidence of ageism within the garment industry in Montreal. Indeed, it was our purpose in this study to assess ageism from the point of view of older workers themselves. In the following discussion we see that workers implicated the owners and managers of the companies they worked for as being ageist, and they implicated themselves as being ageist in some cases as well. Methodologically, we privileged the knowledge, perceptions, and experiences of older workers themselves to better understand the power relations at play in garment work (see Smith 1987   , for a discussion of this method). Results Garment Work in Montreal: Class, Ethnicity, and Gender Before turning to our discussion of ageism, we situate the analysis within the context of the more general nature of garment work in Montreal. The perceptions of the focus group participants about the nature of work in the garment industry concurred with past research, which has shown that garment work is hard work (Das Gupta 1992   ; Frager 1992   ; Gannage 1986   ; Phizacklea 1983   , Phizacklea 1990   ). Managers and owners utilize workers in a quest to maximize productivity and profits. They control their workers by restricting the opportunities of those who sign grievances, by moving "problem" workers to different departments or jobs, and by limiting the use of bathrooms and drinking fountains (McMullin 1996   ). These issues point to how social class, as it is conceptualized by researchers within the political economy tradition, structures the nature of garment work and how individual owners actively use their power to exploit workers.Gender and ethnicity also structure garment work. At the industrial level, 82% of the workers in the ladies' clothing industry in Quebec are women and jobs within the industry are segregated along gender lines. Most of the highly paid jobs are held by men (men make up between 71% and 92% of the three highest paid occupations), and a disproportionate number of women are in the low paying jobs (women constitute between 88% and 96% of the three lowest paid occupations). There is also ethnic segregation within the Montreal garment industry. The tendency is for certain ethnic groups to be concentrated in particular shops, with higher wages being paid in shops where most workers are French Canadian (McMullin 1996   ). Recent immigrants, such as the Vietnamese, are more likely to find low-wage, nonunionized work in shops that accept work that has been contracted out from other shops, or even to be home workers.Past research has shown that women, the working class, and ethnic workers are in disadvantaged labor market positions. In the case of garment work, these factors are simultaneously at play in creating an interlocking system of disadvantage for the majority of workers. Because past work has dealt with these intersections in relation to garment work (Das Gupta 1992   ; Frager 1992   ; Gannage 1986   ; Phizacklea 1983   , Phizacklea 1990   ), we simply make note of this as the context within which our analysis is situated. All of these factors—class, gender, and ethnicity—structure work within the garment industry and create systems of relative disadvantage and powerlessness for those who work there. In the following sections of this article, we show that age is yet another dimension through which systems of disadvantage are at work. Ideological Ageism Past research has shown that sex and ethnic origin are bases of division among the working class and that employers discriminate on the basis of sex and ethnic origin by restricting access to certain jobs. Although age is well recognized as an axis of division among workers (as a basis of seniority, or a basis on which a worker loses the right to work), less is known about whether age is constructed as a cross-cutting basis of division among the working class or if, and how, ageism is implicated within the workplace. In this section, we first examine the role that ageist attitudes and beliefs play in dividing the workers and how these issues are perceived as threats to older workers' job security. Second, we explore issues relating to workers' perceptions of age and productivity. We show how older workers may themselves hold ageist views regarding their own productivity that in turn may conceal underlying reasons for reported productivity decline.The experiences of some of the focus group participants illustrate that a worker's old age may be used by management as a means of intimidating workers. For instance, Madeline (retired, age unknown) told us about how she continued to sign grievances with the union despite considerable opposition from her employer. In the end the employer tried to convince Madeline that she was too old to continue to work and that she should retire:We know that even if the union protects us and they sign grievances, the more they sign grievances—the worse you are regarded. Well I did that anyway. I signed to return to work, as they say, I certainly experienced it after. I went to the office six, seven times a day and he [the boss] encouraged me to retire at the age of 57… [He said] "You realize that you are too old to work now." I said, "No, I'll retire at the same time as everybody else."The collective agreement states that employees have the right to sign grievances against their employers without fear of retaliation (International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, 1994). However, in Madeline's view, the fact that her employer tried to convince her that she was too old to work was linked to the fact that she continued to sign grievances. According to Madeline, the owner used old age as a mask behind which the true nature of the conflict—signing too many grievances—was concealed. Although the collective agreement and Quebec legislation also state that employers must not discriminate on the basis of a worker's age, this employer tried to convince a "problem worker" to retire because she was too old to work. Thus, the owner attempted to hide the class-based nature of this conflict behind the mask of old age. In doing so, he reinforced ageist beliefs and attitudes that suggest that older people should not work. This points to an intersection between social class and age whereby owners use ageist views about older workers as a means of class intimidation.It is widely believed that productivity declines with age, for a number of reasons. Workers are thought to lose cognitive speed and physical stamina; to have greater difficulty adapting to new electronic, machine process, and organizational technologies; and to be less motivated to make these adaptations than younger workers. However, the research basis for these common beliefs is thin, and recent research in particular severely qualifies or contradicts these views (American Association of Retired Persons 1986   ; Berkowitz 1988   ; Butler 1985   ; Centre for Studies of Aging 1995   ; Ilmarinen and Louhevaara 1994   ; Knowles 1988   ; McEvoy and Cascio 1989   ; McNaught and Barth 1992   ; Rix 1994   ) or suggests that any limitations can be easily overcome with thoughtful training and work organizational innovations (Itzin and Phillipson 1993   ; Mital 1994   ; Rix 1990   ). In fact, cognitive decline is minimal during the normal working ages and rarely so great as to fall below levels required for performance (Cerella 1990   ; Charness and Bosman 1992   ; Earles and Salthouse 1995   ); the case studies conducted in the IAW project indicated that physical health is not a strong barrier to work in most settings, and that older workers are quite receptive to technological and organizational changes. In the garment industry, however, the work is physically demanding, and age may be associated with declining productivity at younger ages than in many other industrial sectors.Discussions of the relationship between age and productivity emerged in most of the focus groups, and in one the discussion focused around productivity and piece work. Wages in piece work shops depend on average levels of productivity. If a particular worker cannot produce at or above this rate then their wage suffers. Clarece (employed, aged 57) suggested that her age limited her ability to produce the amount of pieces required for her to make a sufficient wage. As she put it,Sometimes, I have to give tickets for dresses which aren't finished yet to get my pay at the end. They come and get the tickets. Sometimes, I haven't even had the dresses at my place. Well, I have to go and get a package, then, give my tickets. [laugh] It's not funny at all. I should be younger to get more of them done, but I try, I try to get more of them done.However, when Clarece was asked by Angela, the focus group leader, more specifically about her views on the relationship between age and productivity, she elaborated by suggesting that the nature of the work had also changed as she has grown older.Clarece: My nimble fingers are gone! [laugh]Angela: Your productivity decreased with age?Clarece: It's not only age, because, I have been making samples on an hourly basis for almost 8 years, so … one dress, one dress, one dress. While now, it's much more… You can't look up. You have to work, work. So, it's not the same.Indeed, Clarece offered several explanations for her productivity decline that were not directly related to old age. She went on to say that her employers sent the easy work out to contractors and kept the hard work for the experienced employees in the shop. This served to reduce the number of pieces that employees would make and, in turn, limited their wages. Hence, in the end, the ways in which owners organized the work process seemed at least as problematic for Clarece's productivity as did her own old age. However, because Clarece prioritized age in her discussion and joked about the relationship between her age and productivity, ageist stereotypes about diminishing capacities were reinforced and internalized.Some of the older workers believed that the speed and dexterity associated with youth is less important to productivity than the skill and experience characteristic of older workers. As François (employed, aged 60) put it,It's experience… Older people's experience is helping youngsters. Experience. They make less mistakes than a young person. A young person can be active—but, he makes mistakes, a lot of mistakes.Still others linked the relationship between productivity and aging to a combination of stereotypes regarding the speed at which older people can learn and the structural conditions in the garment industry that lead to company closures. Hence, according to these respondents, if older employees remained in the same shop, the productivity between younger and older workers would be equal. However, the productivity of older workers might suffer if they were forced to change shops after having been employed in the same company for 25 or 30 years. This view is illustrated by the following focus group discussion:Dominique (aged 63): Apart from that, when there is a change in work, the work isn't different but there is a change of place. In each place, there is a way of doing things. Also we are a little old and we can't learn new ways of another person quickly. That's why, that's the problem.Angela: So you, so you have a problem learning?Carla (aged 59): To learn the ways of another person.Angela: Oh, I see. Ah, OK.Dominique: Because we are used to a certain way OK. Because of working in the same place, therefore we are all used to it. But then to start to learn at another place—Angela: Other methods.Carla: Yes, other methods, that's it.Dominique: Yes, it is not all the same. When you are in one place—Antonnia (aged 56): The coats are all the same but the way of working depends.Dominique: I work one way, the others work another way, then it is hard to learn afresh. We have no more patience, like what we had when we were young. When we were young we had more patience but now—Carla: It is the same thing, in your home, you have one way, I have another way in the home, the companies are like that. One company has a way of working and another company has another way of working. But the employers are looking for those of us who can work fast. When you work in the same place you work fast because you are used to it, but if I change places, I can't do it quickly because I have to think of how the others do it. The others are not pleased that I'm not fast.Antonnia: Sometimes you forget, sometimes you forget how to do the piece. Sometimes you haven't forgotten the other way and you give it to the person. It is like, like the person is younger and can learn right away. People like us [it's] hard.Two age-related perceptions emerge from this conversation. First, these workers believed that older people have difficulty learning new methods of work. Second, they believed that older people have less patience than younger people. Productivity may suffer when workers of any age are forced to change their habitual work practices, but these workers believed that age is at issue in learning and patience.If workers perceived that their old age was the reason that they were no longer employed, the sense of pride that they had in themselves and their work appeared to be threatened. In the following discussion older workers defended their levels of productivity by comparing their work experience to the work experience of younger women.Angelina: They call us the "old women" but when they put us out they have to bring in three others to do the same work.Madeline: Yes, [but] young people do have some experience.Angelina: But experience is really us, young people can't have experience. They need three young people to replace one of us.Madeline: To do the same production. It takes three. I don't want to be racist but those little Vietnamese who are coming in, because the Quebecers in the industry, you can count them on the fingers of one hand.In defending their levels of productivity, these focus group participants responded to the widely held belief that older workers are less productive. The fact that they acknowledged this belief in their discussion inadvertently reproduced the very view that they were trying to counter. Further, the reference to "those little Vietnamese," suggests that workers' perceptions of their situations were bound to the intersections of ethnicity and age. The comparison these workers made between themselves and younger ethnic workers suggests that these workers felt a sense of division on the basis of age and that this division was enhanced by ethnicity. Age Discrimination and Factory Closures We now turn from ideological to behavioral dimensions of ageism, focusing on the issue of factory closures and resulting job displacement. The competitive nature and structure of garment work influences the business practices that employers use to maximize profits. A strategy that has a long-standing history in the garment industry is that of hiring the least expensive workforce. One method that employers have increasingly used to reduce labor expenses is to replace unionized workers, who tend to be older, with a younger, nonunionized, less expensive workforce. Companies close down and then reopen a few months later under a different name and employing nonunionized labor. According to Gerald Roy, the Canadian director of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the disgrace attached to bankruptcy in the past has dissipated and now firms have lawyers who tell them exactly how to go out of business; how to escape paying their debts to the employees, landlords, machinery rental agencies, and banks; and how and when to open up another, nonunionized, shop. Roy highlighted the seriousness of this problem for apparel industry workers in the following comment:It is too easy to open and close a company in the apparel industry. What is deploring is that the workers are always at the end of the process. They lose conditions of work, they lose their paycheck, they lose vacation pay, they lose their health benefits, they lose their pension benefits, they lose and lose and they are getting older.The fact that Roy mentioned the age of workers in his statement suggests that older workers may be particularly disadvantaged by this practice. Indeed, although the intention of this business strategy is to eliminate the union, one consequence of this practice is that older workers are forced out of their jobs and the labor force because, as we will see in the following section, old age works against them in finding subsequent employment.Several retired workers suggested that their previous employers used subtle age-related strategies in their attempts to make older workers quit their jobs. Carmen, for instance, described how her bosses moved older workers from sit-down jobs to jobs that required them to stand up. When the focus group mediator asked why, the participants responded:Angelina (age unknown): Why? Ha ha!Carmen (aged 64): Because they said they needed this work. Instead of saying, "I am going to take the young Chinese women, because they were all young, 20, 22, 25, [to do the jobs]." I was the oldest in the department.Mary-Jade (age unknown): They [young Chinese women] weren't forced to stand up. They [management] did it on purpose.Angelina: They did it on purpose [and said] "If you don't like it, there's the door"—Carmen: Because they wanted us to say we were not capable and they would have said, "OK. Off you go home." They didn't want to fire us, they would have said, "Well you know what you can do."These older workers stood up on the job for 2 weeks, and then the company closed down. The focus group participants believed that management closed the company when they realized that having the older workers stand at work would not deter them from their jobs. In this situation, the easiest and most profitable scenario for owners was to keep their company open, if at the same time, they could also eliminate their older, highly paid workers. However, because these were unionized workers they could not easily be fired. As a result, it seemed that owners attempted to make the working conditions difficult for older workers so that they would quit their jobs without being forced out. And the owners used ageist beliefs about the relationship between stamina, frailty, and old age to do so. In this case, the strategy that managers used to eliminate the older workers was unsuccessful. The company closed and reopened a short time late under a different name and without the employment of these older workers.This is a story of class conflict—employers trying to eliminate a highly paid, unionized workforce—but it is one that intersects with age. For the workers who lost their jobs with this firm, high wages were not thought to be the reason. Instead, the perception among these workers was that their old age resulted in their unemployment. As Carmen went on to say,We are out, three or four of us, because, we left on the same day, we were put out like dogs. I was more respected when I was young. With all the experience I had, it counted for more.The degradation that Carmen felt when she was "put out like dogs" appeared to be linked to her age, because she went on to say that she was more respected in her youth. Carmen believed, however, that she should be afforded more respect now, not because of her age, but because of her experience as a worker. This points to a contradiction between an ideology that suggests that one should respect the work experience that is associated with aging and the value that is attached to youth in Canada and the United States. On one hand, the logic of capitalism suggests that experienced workers should be valued more because their productivity levels should be higher. On the other hand, common perceptions of older workers' productivity declines attenuates the value that is attached to experience.Few of the garment workers in our study had been untouched by factory closures. When factories close, garment workers find themselves out of work in an economy where jobs are hard to find. Among the workers we talked with, the perception that their old age worked against them getting hired was strong and real. Celine (employed, age unknown) described her search for work as follows:They [previous company] decided that our salaries were too high, so we were laid off, but the company is fine, always increasing… What I find the most difficult is that when you are getting older it starts getting more and more difficult. Shops are closing one after another and you have to … it took me 9 months before I could find a job… And, even if you find another job, you end up with lower wages, by at least $2.50 lower per hour.Similar sentiments were voiced in another focus group. As Maralisa (displaced, aged 56) said, "They always look for somebody younger." Theresa (displaced, age unknown) responded, "For example: You go somewhere; they ask your age, and after, they say, ah, ah. For the application, they say yes; then, after they say ah, no, no, no. We have no work. Come back next week. We'll see, maybe."In response to our queries about age discrimination in the search for work, Leigh (displaced, aged 60) suggested that older workers were disadvantaged because "If older it costs. And you are slowed down. And the company doesn't like this." Thus, older workers interpreted their search for work as one that was laden with ageism that resulted in discrimination. They believed that employers wanted to hire young workers, either because they believed that they could pay them lower wages or because they felt that older workers' productivity had declined.Many believed that they were faced with a paradox in being too old to find work yet too young to receive retirement benefits. This paradox translated into worries about current financial difficulties and questions regarding how they would pay for their retirement. These issues are illustrated in following discussion:José (aged 53): We have to accept it [factories closing and having to take work at lower pay] but it's difficult. Like me, I started very young and it's been a lot of years. I've been in the union for quite a long time, and I mean I have nothing. I'm facing nothing, nothing. I'm still too young for early retirement… You've been working for 25 years, with all your heart, all your soul. You gave up your health and you fall face to face with nothing there.France (aged 63): We even lost a lot of weeks of salary, vacations—José: We lost part of our early retirement [pension contributions].France: Yes, we gave our work and we lost it all.José: We lost everything, there were people laid off. There were people who had so many weeks per year they had worked. We got nothing like it.France: We didn't receive a notice. One day, you went home, and the next day, the doors were closed. There were some who received notices—we didn't get any notice. And we lost weeks of salary and vacation. Our vacations, they didn't send them to the Joint Commission.José: There are a lot amounts lost. We lost money—France: It [the company] still exists.José: It's difficult because they changed the name, they changed the company, but the name is still there. They took three, four girls and they went.This discussion illustrates how the industry practice of closing and then reopening a shop was experienced by the workers themselves. After years of working in the industry, José and France believed that, in the end, they were treated unfairly because of the many losses they faced when their company closed down. José was concerned about her current and future financial security, whereas France was more concerned with immediate losses based on the company's payment defaults. The different points of focus in this conversation may be based on age. For instance, on the surface it appeared as if José and France were affected in similar ways by a company closure. However, because France was 63 years old and José was aged 53, their financial options were quite different. France could apply for reduced state and Union pensions, whereas José had to either find work (a difficult endeavor in the current economic climate) or go on welfare. Thus, the seemingly age-neutral strategy of closing a business has different structural consequences for the workers affected by it depending on their age. Younger workers do not have to fight ageism in their search for work, the oldest workers have the option of retiring, and those in the middle must confront age discrimination in hiring practices. Discussion and Conclusions Ageism in Garment Work: Behavior and Ideology In the introductory sections of this article we identified two components of ageism—ideology and behavior. Ageist attitudes, values, and beliefs that make up the ideological dimension of ageism need not be harmful to individuals, but this dimension often transpires into ageist behavior that is discriminatory. Drawing on a case study of garment workers in Montreal, we document how ageism is manifested at the ideological level of attitudes and stereotypes contrasting older and younger workers, and how it is manifested behaviorally as age discrimination. We argue that attitudes and behavior have related but independent impacts in structuring people's lives.Regarding ageist ideology, workers in the Montreal garment industry, most of whom are women, see their fate as tied to and affected by ageism. They believe that their work experience, which they view as one of the positive aspects of aging, is discounted by owners and managers, who focus instead on real or putative age-related declines in stamina and dexterity. To some extent, the workers accept the negative stereotypes held by the owners and managers, and negative stereotypes about dexterity and productivity appear to be produced and reproduced by older workers themselves. Older workers also counter that age and experience bring greater skill, fewer mistakes, and the ability to help younger workers. However, the fact that older workers feel the need to defend their work skills serves to reinforce the very ageist ideology that older workers try to guard against.With respect to age discrimination, owners and managers do not appear to be overtly ageist. Rather, they make decisions about their workers and the work setting that are based largely on structural factors other than the age of the workers. For example, many of them want to be rid of older, unionized workers because they command higher wages than younger, nonunionized employees. The issue for them is cost reduction, and age is implicated only indirectly in their reasoning. Hence, the focus in the political economy of aging tradition on class relations is important within the context of paid garment work.However, owners and managers do make use of age, including stereotypical and negative images of the older worker, as a legitimation for attempts to exclude or discourage older workers from employment. They do not organize the work routines so as to facilitate the adaptation of older workers to waning dexterity or physical strength. Instead, they contract out the easy jobs, relying on the experience of the older employees for the more difficult work but not adapting the pace or demands of the work. Real or supposed age-related declines in dexterity and physical ability become rationales to force or induce older workers to leave employment. When inducements fail, owners sometimes close the plants, reopening them soon after with younger, cheaper workers. In the end, seemingly age-neutral strategies of cost reduction become systems of inequality in which age is implicated and older workers are placed at a heightened disadvantage relative to younger workers. In support of Laws 1995    argument, this suggests that there is something unique about age relations that creates disadvantage and must be considered as intersecting with issues of class.Whereas negative stereotypes about older workers, and ageist attitudes toward them, undoubtedly play a part in the fact that older displaced workers almost never return to employment and are thus discriminated against, the economic calculations of owners and managers play a role as well. The severe economic pressures experienced by the Montreal garment industry cannot be ignored. The industry is in decline, making bankruptcies a more acceptable strategy and encouraging the use of contract labor, which is done for the most part by younger, nonunionized, immigrant workers. These managerial strategies produce casualties no less severe than the casualties that follow from restructuring through the downsizing that is found in less marginal sectors of the economy, but the limited human capital of garment workers—their gender, their limited education, their ethnicity, and their low social class position—likely intersects with their age to adversely affect these marginalized players in the world economy. Understanding Ageism: Structured Age Relations and Individual Action Clearly, ageism does not function in any simple way to structure work relations. How then do we explain the ageist views and behavior that are present within the garment industry in Montreal? Our theoretical approach encompasses a recognition of structured age relations and individual action. The research presented here suggests that age relations shape both the ideological and behavioral components of ageism within garment work. At an ideological level age relations organize and regulate the attitudes that workers have about their own and younger peoples' work. Older workers situate their discussion within their own work experiences but frame them around widely held beliefs about the productivity of older workers. At a behavioral level, owners use both class relations and age relations to exclude and eliminate workers from employment opportunities.In this article we have focused on the social processes through which age becomes relevant in the lives of garment workers and in doing so have shown how age relations shape productive work relations. In discussing their experiences, workers actively construct age categories and place people into them on the basis of their own and other workers' chronological ages. As a result of such categorization, a structure of age relations is reproduced within garment industry work. Older workers are thought to be less powerful and less productive than younger workers, and alternatively, older workers are thought to have more experience, be more responsible, and make fewer mistakes in their work than younger workers. Regardless of whether any of these views are "true," the fact that they appear in the discourse of the workers suggests that age is a potential basis of division and conflict among the working class and thus a threat to working class solidarity.However, we do not believe that social structural forces of age relations, class relations, or other bases of difference are located outside of the actions of individuals. Although properties of social structural relations constrain and limit the agency of the individual, they never do so completely. Older workers in the Montreal garment industry do not experience fates that are inexorably shaped by external forces. They experience enormous constraints but they nevertheless make choices and act strategically in terms of the options they see available to them. Indeed, older workers resist owners' and managers' attempts at using their "old age" as an intimidation tactic or threat. But this agency is deeply embedded in social structure, of which age structuring processes constitute one dimension. Individuals act within the structure of age relations to both reinforce and challenge it (see Giddens 1993   ).  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: To describe death-related planning and preferences for place of death among well elders in a community characterized by a low rate of hospital deaths. Design and Methods: Cross-sectional prevalence survey of independent-living residents (n = 219) of a continuing-care retirement community (CCRC) in Central North Carolina characterized by a low rate of hospital deaths. Results: Death-related planning played a part in the decision of 40% of residents to move to the CCRC. A majority of residents reported a clear preference for place of death, and a majority of these preferred to die on the CCRC campus. Most residents wanted to discuss their preferences for place of death with their health care provider. Preferences for place of death appear consistent across age cohorts and are relevant to elders' long-term care decisions. Implications: Given the striking discrepancy between patients' preferences for nonhospital deaths and the high prevalence of hospital deaths in the United States, this often-neglected issue should be routinely addressed in end-of-life planning. The CCRC may be a practice model that is particularly compatible with personal preferences for place of death.   Terminal care ,  Continuity of care ,  Place of death ,  Geriatrics Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDMost patients in the United States would prefer to die at home, when in fact most die in acute care hospitals (American Health Decisions 1997   ; Groth-Junker and McCusker 1983   ; Institute of Medicine 1997   ; McCusker 1984   ; Pritchard et al. 1998   ; Tolle, Rosenfeld, Tilden, and Park 1999   ; Zusman and Tschetter 1984   ). Nearly three-quarters of U.S. deaths take place in institutions (57% in hospitals, 17% in nursing homes) with the remaining 20% at home and 6% elsewhere (Institute of Medicine 1997   ). The striking discrepancy between patient preferences and outcomes has been reported for other end-of-life issues (Danis et al. 1996   ; Hakim et al. 1996   ; Teno, Lynn, et al. 1997   ). The widespread perception that institutional factors routinely override the preferences of dying patients has renewed interest in the causal web of place of death (Chin, Hedberg, Higginson, and Fleming 1999   ; Coulehan 1997   ; Donaldson and Field 1998   ; Meier, Morrison, and Cassel 1997   ; Morrison, Meier, and Cassel 1996   ; Teno, Branco, et al. 1997   ; Dartmouth Medical School, Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1998   ).Although affected slightly by patient preferences, place of death is subject to demographic and clinical factors, with lower odds of hospital death among White and married patients and those with specific diagnoses (e.g., cancer; Fried, Pollack, Drickamer, and Tinetti 1999   ; Pritchard et al. 1998   ). However, geographic region of the United States—likely acting as a proxy variable for structural features of local health systems, such as bed availability and access to nursing homes and hospice services—appears to be the most powerful predictor of place of death (Pritchard et al. 1998   ; Tolle et al. 1999   ). In this context, a recent report (Galanos and Sash 1998   ) is of interest because it states that only 12% of recent deaths among residents of a large North Carolina continuing care retirement community (CCRC) occurred in hospitals; this is particularly interesting in a region where prevalence of hospital deaths of Medicare patients (37%) is comparable to the national average (39%; Dartmouth Medical School, Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1998   ).CCRCs, or life-care communities, provide housing and services, including health care, to persons of retirement age and are distinguished by the terms of their long-term contracts, the types of accommodations available, and the fee structure (Branch 1987   ; Sherwood, Ruchlin, Sherwood, and Morris 1997   ; Somers 1993   ). A CCRC contract typically assures the lifetime use of an independent-living unit (e.g., cottage or apartment) or a nursing home bed on the CCRC campus, as well as a range of amenities and support services, for a substantial entrance fee and fixed monthly payments. CCRC health care services vary widely. Most offer social services, assisted living units, skilled nursing, and recreational therapy; one-third provide home health care; and one-quarter offer CCRC physician services (Somers and Spears 1992   ). Although only 1% of U.S. elders lived in CCRCs in the mid-1990s, it has been estimated that residence in such communities will be affordable for 25% of those aged 75 and older by the year 2020 (Somers 1993   ; Somers and Spears 1992   ; United States General Accounting Office 1997   ).CCRCs represent one model of voluntary self-insurance against late-life impoverishment as a result of long-term care (LTC) costs. Whether CCRC residents consider end-of-life issues, in addition to LTC issues, during their decision-making process has not been examined (Cohen, Tell, Batten, and Larson 1988   ; Gupta and Galanos 1996   ; Sherwood et al. 1997   ). (Indeed, preferences for place of death in other nonclinical, elderly samples have not been well characterized.) If CCRCs generally display elevated odds of nonhospital deaths, and if residents report high preferences for nonhospital deaths, then CCRCs may provide a model not only for securing long-term and terminal care, but also for supporting end-of-life preferences. This descriptive survey was designed to examine death-related motivations to enter a CCRC, current preference for place of death, and importance placed on communication with clinicians about place of death among well elders whose preferences for place of death are unconstrained with respect to cost. Methods Design and Sample We used a cross-sectional prevalence survey design. The sample was drawn from the same CCRC in Durham, North Carolina, studied by Galanos and Sash 1998   . The CCRC provides three service levels: (a) independent living units, (b) assisted living units, and (c) a non–Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility (SNF), with no fee differential across levels for residents who enter at the level of independent. Decisions about transfers between levels of care are made by a multidisciplinary health care team; no formalized transfer criteria are utilized. Health care staff include a board-certified geriatrician with admitting privileges to a tertiary care medical center in the community, as well as dentistry, podiatry, gynecology, nursing, and physical and speech therapy; geropsychiatry consultation is also available. Primary care charges are billed to Medicare B. No home health or hospice services are provided to independent living unit residents; hospice consultation is available for SNF residents. The contract does not discriminate between terminal care and other types of care.On the basis of previous work on preferences for place of death (Hays, Gold, Flint, and Winer 1999   ), we developed a brief, anonymous questionnaire that was approved by the Investigation Review Boards of both Duke University Medical Center and the CCRC. We distributed questionnaires to all independent living unit residents of the community. Of 331 surveys distributed, 222 were returned (response rate: 67.1%). Of the 222 returned surveys, 147 were completed by women and 75 by men. This response rate exactly reflected the 1:1.8 male-to-female ratio in the CCRC. We excluded from the study three respondents who completed the questionnaire but did not complete the item on preference for place of death. The effective sample size was n = 219. Measures The questionnaire included four death-related items. To assess end-of-life-related decision making, respondents were asked, "Did any issue surrounding death and dying play a role in your decision to move to a CCRC—Yes or No?" To assess preference(s) for place of death, respondents were asked, "Where would you prefer to die—hospital, your apartment or cottage, healthcare facility on the CCRC campus, no preference, or do not know?" To assess the conditionality of the preference, respondents were asked, "If you have a preference, how certain is it—unconditional (no change under any circumstance) or conditional on (check all that apply): symptom control; amount, type, or duration of care needed; concerns about family or costs, and ‘other’ concerns?" To assess current death-related planning, respondents were asked, "How important is it that the medical community address a patient's preference for place of death—very important, important, somewhat important, or not important?" With the exception of the CCRC decision-making item, all item stems were identical to those used in previous work (Hays et al. 1999   ); additional response options were added to the stems, based on the CCRC setting, for example, "your cottage or apartment" was substituted for "your home." Other closed-ended items included age, gender, marital status, years of education, religious affiliation, the importance of religion in the respondent's daily life, and self-rated health.Open-ended formats were linked to two items. Respondents who considered death-related issues when choosing a CCRC, and those with a conditional preference for place of death, were asked to "please explain" their responses. The questionnaire concluded with a general request: "Any thoughts or reactions you wish to share are welcome on a separate sheet." Analytical Strategy Descriptive statistics are presented below. Participants who affirmed the importance of discussing preferred place of death with the medical community were compared to those who did not, using the chi-square statistic or Fisher's Exact Test, as appropriate. Qualitative data were transcribed and grouped into themes independently by two of the authors (JCH/EPF). Results Respondents were primarily female (65%) and married (57%); 27% were aged 85 years or older. Most respondents (84%) stated a religious affiliation (primarily Christian Protestant); religion was important in daily life for 58% of the sample. Approximately three quarters of the sample rated their overall health as good or excellent.Forty percent of respondents (n = 82) reported that issues surrounding death and dying played a role in their decision to move to a CCRC. Those respondents were slightly more likely (p = .09) to rate their overall health as fair or poor versus good or excellent.Seventy percent of survey respondents expressed at least one preference for place of death (59% with a single preference, and 11% with more than one preference); 20% had no preference, and the remaining 10% did not know. Approximately two thirds of the sample preferred to die on the CCRC campus: 36% in their apartment or cottage; 18% in the CCRC SNF, and 10% in either ( Fig. 1 ). Five percent of respondents listed the hospital as the only preferred place of death, and 2% included the hospital among two or more listed preferences. Eighty-nine percent (n = 171) of all preferences for place of death were conditional, and 46% of these listed two or more conditions, including type (77%), amount (76%), or duration (70%) of care; illness symptoms (50%); family concerns (33%); and cost concerns (32%).Sixty-one percent of respondents rated talking with their health care providers about their preferences for place of death very important; an additional 25% rated this issue somewhat important. Addressing this concern was significantly more important for the oldest residents (p = .04); unmarried residents (p = .05); residents in worse health (p = .03); residents who had a stated preference for place of death (p = .003); residents whose preference was to die on the CCRC campus (p = .08); and residents whose preference for place of death was unconditional (p = .05;  Fig. 2 ). Neither gender, religiousness, nor death-related planning prior to entering a CCRC distinguished those who wanted physicians to address "place of death" from those who did not.Eighty-seven percent (n = 71) of those who reported that death-related issues affected their plans to join a CCRC attached explanatory comments. Five themes emerged most prominently: (a) the need for terminal illness care (as distinct from wellness or disability care), (b) concerns about burden on family, (c) concerns about isolation, (d) desire to be near one's spouse, and (e) lack of proximity to extended family. One respondent wrote, "We wanted care for terminal illness, as we had no family in our previous home." Several respondents wished to compensate for a perceived shortfall in social resources at the end of life, preferring "to die gracefully and not to be a strain on our children." Another respondent anticipated an expanding social network at the end of life, and wanted "to be all under one roof with spouse and new friends … until death." Others' decisions to enter a CCRC were related to friendship bereavements ("All our friends were dying") or to global ratings of person–place fit ("[This is] a good place to die!").Thirteen percent (n = 22) of those with a conditional preference for place of death appended additional comments. One respondent who preferred to die in the CCRC SNF added the caveat:If the final stage is better controlled by the hospital than by the facilities here, it would be better to be ushered out as painlessly as possible. But other things being equal, I know I'll get TLC [tender loving care] from the staff [at the SNF] and from friends who will be near at hand, and it would not be like dying in the impersonal atmosphere of a hospital.Respondents who expressed no preference for place of death assigned higher priority to issues of duration or trajectory than to issues of place, for example, "wherever it's fastest," or "I don't care a hoot where I die so long as it is quick, and I'm still active right up to the end." Others emphasized spiritual considerations, for example,"[I'll die] when God decides my time has come," or "It's up to God."General comments (n = 106) were written on approximately half of the questionnaires. Many expanded on previous closed-ended responses, for example, the respondent who explained his preference for the SNF over his apartment or cottage: "[I] don't want my wife to always think of our home as where I died." Others emphasize communication with physicians, using written documentation: "I have a Living Will, and my wishes are explained in it" and "See medical directive!" One respondent expressed an ongoing openness to the topic: "I would hope and expect to have understanding and cooperation if or when I need assistance in the ‘where, when, and how’ I'm facing at the end of my long and good life." Another respondent wanted a "discussion [about] burial or cremation as well." In contrast, two residents who rated such a discussion not important wrote: "My way of handling the thought of death is not to think about it," and "a premature or aggressive approach to the subject could be emotionally disturbing and lead to depression." Discussion This preliminary examination of preference for place of death has at least three important implications for geriatric practice. First, older Americans living in the community, like their younger counterparts, prefer not to die in hospitals and want to communicate that to their health providers. Second, a sizeable minority of older Americans in CCRCs were influenced not only by concerns for LTC, but also by concerns related to dying and death. Third, in addition to the advantages already documented in the extant literature, CCRCs may represent a model for matching elders' personal preferences for place of death with actual clinical practice.Community-based studies of preferences for place of death among U.S. residents are rare. Two studies, which included few elders, reported preferences for a home over a hospital death by ratios on the order of 5:3 among Mexican Americans, 2:1 among African Americans, and 4:1 among Whites and Japanese Americans in Los Angeles, California, and 2:1 in rural North Carolina (Kalish and Reynolds 1976   ; Zusman and Tschetter 1984   ). Adults sampled more recently in Australia (Ashby and Wakefield 1993   ) and Italy (Toscani, Cantoni, DiMola, Mori, Santosuosso, and Tamburini 1991   ) favored home death over hospital death by 3:1. Our preliminary examination expands the evidence to include well elders in their seventh, eighth, and ninth decades and suggests a remarkable stability in preference for home death over hospital death across the age spectra.Furthermore, these independently living elders placed significant importance on communicating to the clinical guild their preferences for "place of death," a relatively neglected aspect of patients' terminal care preferences. Discussions of place-of-death preferences represent an important clinical teaching opportunity. As Kaufman 1998    and others (Addington-Hall, MacDonald, Anderson, and Freeling 1991   ; Benoliel and Degner 1995   ; Fischer, Tulsky, Rose, Siminoff, and Arnold 1998   ) have noted, much of what is known about the process of dying and the technologies and services useful in terminal care are not common knowledge. Geriatric practitioners may elicit concerns, confusion, or uncertainties about place of death that could be resolved with information or strategic planning. In previous work, we found that even Stage 4 oncology patients lack information on hospice care, pain management options, respite and home health aide services, and family counseling opportunities (Hays et al. 1999   ). In the current study, 62 participants listed "cost" as relevant to their place-of-death preference, in a community where direct costs to residents for the continuum of care are fixed.Studies of the motivation to enter CCRCs have emphasized access to long-term medical care and guaranteed housing, rather than end-of-life issues (Gupta and Galanos 1996   ; Sherwood et al. 1997   ). We found that end-of-life issues influenced the decisions of nearly half our sample to enter this CCRC. Continuity of care during the terminal phases of illness and across care sites may be an underappreciated benefit of this and other continuous care models, and one which could be better promoted to populations underserved by each of the models of continuing care.The role of the CCRC as a potential mediator between terminally ill residents and the greater medical culture is not well understood. It has been shown that achieving one's preference for place of death is more likely when end-of-life issues, such as preparation of an advance directive, are addressed (Institute of Medicine 1997   ; Teno, Lynn, et al. 1997   ; Tolle et al. 1999   ). In the CCRC described herein, the same physician provides health care on campus, exercises acute-care admitting privileges on behalf of residents, and directs their care during tertiary care hospitalizations. Such provider continuity, including the effective transfer of advance directives across different clinical settings, may have contributed to the low prevalence of deaths in acute care settings in this sample (Galanos and Sash 1998   ). CCRCs may also provide particularly effective communication and support of informal caregivers. Physical and emotional exhaustion of family caregivers and patients associated with a prolonged terminal phase is the most frequent reason for institutional deaths among elders who prefer to die at home (Groth-Junker and McCusker 1983   ). For families increasingly involved in decision making at the end of a patient's life, CCRCs provide settings for care that are "known quantities": chosen and financed in advance of need, clustered in a single setting, staffed by clinicians known not only to the patient, but to the family as well, and thus an acceptable alternative to a high-tech environment.The findings from this study are highly preliminary and lack generalizability. CCRC residents are more likely to be White, well-educated, and financially secure than their community-dwelling age peers (Sherwood et al. 1997   ), and the population of this CCRC is typical in these respects. However, it is precisely in such a population—one that is relatively healthy and financially unconstrained—that unbiased preferences are most likely to be elicited. This study was also limited to a single CCRC, and its contract, service levels, and fee structure will differ from other CCRCs. Whether enrollees in any of the patchwork of programs that constitute U.S. health care for elders (e.g., other CCRCs, Program of All-inclusive Care of the Elderly projects [Eng, Pedulla, Eleazer, McCann, and Fox 1997   ], or social/health care maintenance organizations [Kane et al. 1997   ]) or enrollees in more prevalent managed care or fee-for-service practices report similar place-of-death preferences and similar prevalent desires to discuss those preferences with their care provider is a topic of great importance for practice-based research. A recent study of homebound elders in a small community-based, physician-led house call program showed comparable prevalence of planning (64%), prevalence of preferences for home death (5:1), and health status as a predictor of planning (Leff, Kaffenbarger, and Remsburg 2000   ). Finally, the cross-sectional design of this survey does not permit estimates of success rates. We cannot be sure that high rates of out-of-hospital deaths among CCRC residents are associated with the resident's preferences for deaths in the community.There is reason to hope that the culture surrounding death is changing and that caring professions will embrace end-of-life care as important and possessing its own body of knowledge and skills (Carron, Lynn, and Keaney 1999   ; Hammes and Rooney 1998   ; Tolle et al. 1999   ). Given adequate control of symptoms, many older adults wish to die in low-intervention settings. Honoring this preference may be easiest where health systems and policy support specialization in geriatric care and structural linkages across community, long-term, and acute care settings.

     During my career, my attention became focused on elder community care policy after reading a Commonwealth Fund-supported report of the Commission on Chronic Illness (1956) Care of the Long-Term Patient. The report described the problems of coordination and integration of services for the patient with multiple needs, which required simultaneous solutions. It argued for some type of community-based central organization to oversee and plan for the needs of long-term patients. (Note the focus on the long term patient, not the long-term care system.)The Community Welfare Council of Schenectady, where I held my first professional job, issued a report in 1964 detailing the chronic illness needs in Schenectady County, New York. I wrote that report with technical assistance from the State Charities Aid Association of New York and the New York State Department of Health. This report was written in the time before the establishment of Medicare. It was a time when Visiting Nurse Association nurses returned to their offices at 4 p.m. each day, filled out their records and sharpened their hypodermic needles in a needle sharpener (similar to the one used for pencils). The report listed a number of radical recommendations such as: (a) acute care hospitals should establish stroke rehabilitation programs, (b) married couples residing in the gender-segregated county nursing home should be able to visit each other, (c) nursing homes should have at least one registered nurse available to oversee care, (d) a community-wide home-care program should be created, (e) Blue Cross/Blue Shield should reimburse for in-home care, and (f) a new homemaker program should be established. That report is almost 40 years old.I was a student at the Heller School, Brandeis University, from 1965 to 1968, where Robert Morris chaired my dissertation Obstacles to Community Planning for the Elderly (Callahan 1968   ). From 1969 to 1972, I was director of the Massachusetts Medicaid Program. Morris wanted to do a study of elders on Old Age Assistance and asked for my help in getting access to records and people. These were the years when the Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP), a prepaid staff model group practice, had been established. Medicaid actually had a contract with HCHP for 1,200 Aid to Families With Dependent Children recipients in the Mission Hill area of Boston. Morris produced a report calling for the creation of a prepaid organization (like HCHP) to provide social services to elders, for which he had found a great need. Services would include homemaking, chores, transportation, meals, legal services, etc. It would be called the Personal Care Organization (PCO). We moved ahead, received one of the early 1115 waivers, and created a PCO in Worcester, Massachusetts. Two others were established in Wisconsin. All this happened about 30 years ago.From 1973 to 1977, I managed a long-term care hospital and school for physically handicapped children. My first task there was to move 48 children back into the community as part of the reform of special education. Our staff was only successful with about half of the group because of the lack of home- and community-based services (HCBS). Therefore policy makers need to think beyond older persons when considering HCBS.Massachusetts had the first statewide public home-care system operated by a department of aging in the United States. I was Secretary of Elder Affairs in 1977 when statewide coverage of the home-care network was completed. It was a system conceptually designed by a task force that was supported by former Secretary of Elder Affairs Jack Leff and led by Louis Lowy of Boston University. The task force had access to empirical data generated by Laurence Branch in his longitudinal study of the health and social service needs of people age 65 and older in Massachusetts (Branch 1977   ). The underlying concepts of the home care model were to: (a) destigmatize the receipt of services previously provided by the welfare department; (b) achieve local and/or consumer input; (c) reduce government red tape; (d) focus on case management; and (e) serve as a repository for funds from many sources. The result was the establishment of 27 locally based nonprofit case management agencies with funding from the state, municipalities, and private sources. The home-care network was a small step toward the vision of the 1956 Commission on Chronic Illness report.In 1979, I moved to the Heller School to work on disability and long-term care. Federal support for the PCO idea was vanishing, but Stuart Altman and Stan Wallack were working on a number of projects with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and soon the PCO idea and needs of the Medicare program merged to create the concept of the Social Health Maintenance Organization (SHMO). Four SHMOs were established in the first round of demonstration funding in the early 80s. Now the SHMO, conceived 20 years ago, has an ongoing designation in Medicare. During this same period, I was involved in the process evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration (better known as "channeling"), which demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of a case management approach to HCBS.In the last 10 years, I have worked on Robert Wood Johnson Foundation projects with my colleague Susan Lanspery: (a) Life Care at Home; (b) Supportive Services Program in Senior Housing (SSPSH); (c) Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs); and (d) affordable assisted living. Both Susan and I believe, along with some other observers, that the SSPSH program influenced the Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand its policy and financial support of service coordinators in senior housing.From the perspective of this long background, I suggest that a surgeon general's report is needed for in-home and community-based services. There are three developments that inspired me to call for such a report. First, is the example of the surgeon general's report on mental health. There have been many surgeon general's reports over the years. One author cites 50 (Hegner 2000   ). Perhaps the most famous are those on tobacco, but there have been others dealing with preventive health care, children, nutrition, and oral health. This year the surgeon general's report on mental health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000) was released and has done a service for mental health consumers, providers, and funders by gathering and evaluating the scientific evidence underlying our understanding of mental health.The mental health report took a public health focus that included not only issues of diagnosis, treatment, and etiology, but also epidemiological surveillance, health promotion, prevention, and evaluation. A recent book Public Health and Aging edited by Tom Hickey, Marjorie Speers, and Thomas Prohaska has recommended a similar public health approach for services to older persons (Hickey, Speers, and Prohaska 1997   ).A public health approach may disclose new options or revive former strategies for serving elders. For example, in the book by Hickey and colleagues, Kutza 1997    argues for a return to a neighborhood approach, to bring services closer to older people who usually do not stray very far from their homes. I have a particular interest in naturally occurring retirement communities—essentially neighborhoods with a dense population of elders—and have argued that density makes a difference. Density will offer economies of scale, opportunities for elder participation, and the potential for physical and housing planning. In another chapter, in the Hickey and colleagues book, Andersen and Pourat present an integrated public health-aging paradigm (Andersen and Pourat 1997   ). Its elements are a focus on older people, concern with chronic disease, secondary and tertiary prevention, a community orientation, and population-based interventions. This model could guide the development of a surgeon general's report.The surgeon general's report on mental health identified and suggested resolution to fundamental issues that have plagued mental health and/or illness over the years: (a) the artificial separation of mind and body; (b) the deeply embedded problem of stigma; and (c) questions about the validity of the scientific base of mental health and/or illness research. HCBS agencies have their own set of fundamental issues policymakers need to identify and resolve. My list includes: (a) medical versus social models; (b) professional versus consumer direction; (c) risk versus autonomy; and (d) home versus institution. Versus may be the wrong term; maybe some combination of both/and would fit better.A surgeon general's report on HCBS must address how to reduce ethnic and racial disparities of access and quality. Marian Gornick, of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, who had a 20-year policy career at the HCFA, has recently published a book on vulnerable populations and why disparities exist within Medicare (Gornick 2000   ). Works like this add to the evidence base of HCBS.Although the substance of the mental health report is impressive, the process used to produce it, I believe, strengthens its results and guarantees its implementation. There was broad representation from the scientific, practice, and research communities, from various agencies on the national, state, and local levels—public and private. Most important, the process included consumers of mental health and family members of mental health consumers. Both of these groups have articulate organizations to put forth their messages.A surgeon general's report on HCBS should adopt a similar process and strive to be inclusive of all the interests. Policymakers need to identify parallels in the aging field for the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Mental Patients Liberation Front, Empower, and the mental health recovery movement. This level of consumer interest and expertise must be included, along with gender, ethnic, and racial minority groups. Membership organizations like AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare and Social Security, and the National Council of Senior Citizens will be important for both ideas and implementation.Certainly, families and caregivers are essential partners in HCBS. There is probably no one reading this who has not directly or indirectly been affected by caregiving needs or responsibilities. Employers and directors of employee assistance plans can contribute to this process. And the service users themselves would have to be heard from—from their bedside if necessary. Putting together the right people and the right process would be a first step in a surgeon general's HCBS report.Second, members of the gerontological community know the goals and values of home- and community-based care. These goals are to be where an older person's preference lies, where autonomy is exercised, and where dignity is supported. This does not mean the cheapest solution. It does not depend on a simple cost benefit analysis. It is a value commitment. It is a societal choice up front that sets the constraints on the analytic tasks required to identify and design the HCBS system or systems older persons require.This is a position I have held for a long time. Testifying on the issue of alternatives to institutional care before a Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing in 1977, I noted that some analysts were arguing that the cost of caring for an elder in the community may be greater than in an institution. I argued:If one follows this reasoning to its conclusion, we may decide that the institution is indeed the way of solving many of the problems of elders. I think it is very important at the very beginning of my remarks to meet this line of reasoning head on. The community is not an alternative to the institution. Rather, the institution is an alternative, and a very specialized alternative, to community living. (Hearing Before the Special Committee on Aging, 1977)Finally, I believe there is now substantial evidence on HCBS to be evaluated. There is a long history of research and institutional memory in the federal government. Frank Caro 2000   , in a proposal for a major conference on long-term care, has recently noted:From time to time, the Aging, Disability, and Long-Term Care unit in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluations of DHHS, Administration on Aging, the Health Care Financing Administration, the Agency for Health Research and Quality, the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute on Mental Health, and the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation research have all supported research on long term care. (p. 6)There is the output of gerontological research programs and centers. There are growing bodies of market analyses revealing the preferences of older people. And there are new books on relevant evidence. I reviewed two recently: Home Care Advances: Essential Research and Policy Issues edited by Binstock and Cluff 2000   , and New Ways to Care for Older People: Building Systems Based on Evidence edited by Calkins, Boult, Wagner, and Pacala 1999   . A significant number of evidence-based reports on home care were presented at the American Public Health Association's recent annual meeting in Boston. Clearly, the time is ripe for a new national synthesis on HCBS, which a surgeon general's report could achieve.A surgeon general's report would give credibility and visibility to this area of elder service. It will become a tool that can be used by proponents and planners of HCBS. Recently, Mike Hammond of the Kansas Department on Aging made a presentation at a Center for Mental Health Services conference. His paper was entitled "Elderly and Aging Issues: Putting the Surgeon General's Report to Work for Older Adults" (Hammond 2000   ). It is a wonderful example of using the surgeon general's report on mental health to identify issues, describe outreach approaches, and provide substantive knowledge of mental health and aging. A report on HCBS could be put to similar use.A surgeon general's report could become a platform for further research, as well as for specific policy recommendations. The process of engagement with people and ideas could energize the field, just at the time when gerontologists need such energizing, amidst the chaos of the health care world. Solutions to the problems are not easy. But one thing is certain: there will be many old people dealing with their needs and problems (many gerontologists among them) and they deserve the resolve of researchers and policy makers to provide answers.The ForumI thank Gerry Eggert and Joan Callahan for helpful comments on this paper.

     Abstract Purpose: This study compared patterns of care, including hospitalization, during the last year of life for a group of residents in institutional long-term care. These subjects were either implicitly or explicitly in palliative care modes versus those who remained in active treatment or blended care. Design and Methods: The study used a retrospective chart review and both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis to examine indepth the end-of-life experiences of 41 nursing home residents who died in the nursing care unit of one large continuing care retirement community during an 18-month period. Results: Most residents die in palliative care modes, but their movement into palliation with comfort care and symptom management is often slowed by indecision or inaction on the part of key decision makers, interrupted by aggressive acute care, or delayed until the last few days of life. Implications: Transitions from active curative care to palliative care are important for residents in permanent long-term care placements. Improved end-of-life care requires more attention to these transitions and to the decisions that residents, their families, and care teams are called upon to make.   Advance directives ,  Caregiver coalitions ,  End-of-life care Laurence G. Branch, PhDIn the mid 1970s, efforts to understand transitions in care that would be required for growing numbers of individuals surviving to advanced ages with chronic care needs resulted in the conceptualization of a living–dying trajectory that included intervals for living, living–dying, and dying and death (Pattison 1977   ). More recent applications of this continuum to long-term care (LTC) include the suggestion that nearly all permanently placed nursing facility residents enter care in the chronic living–dying interval (Engle 1998   ; Lawhorne 1999   ; Pattison 1977   ). Practitioners and organizations that care for these residents face multiple decision points during the residents' long-term care. At these times, an assessment of benefits over harmful effects (beneficence) should guide treatment decisions (Rhymes and McCullough 1994   ) that are based on an understanding of the resident's prognosis and placement on the living–dying continuum.In this article we report: (a) hospitalization prevalence and incidence rates, (b) differences in the timing and duration of palliative care modalities for nursing facility residents who were hospitalized versus those who were not, and (c) aspects of caregiver coalitions that appear to distinguish between residents who were hospitalized and those who were not. Review of the Literature Palliation is the term now used to describe care that is no longer aimed at cure or active treatment of medical conditions. Instead, the goals of palliation are resident comfort and symptom management (Mann and Welk 1997   ; Post and Dubler 1997   ). For some LTC residents with chronic illness, blended care (active treatment with palliation) may last for years with relatively short periods dedicated solely to palliation. For others, such as those with Alzheimer's disease, it has been argued that palliative care should be the dominant mode of care for the long term (Solomon and Jennings 1998   ). When death is imminent, generally in the last 6 months of life, the specialized knowledge of the hospice team, now conceptualized as a component of palliative care, is used for the final transition from dying to death (Mann and Welk 1997   ).One of the more critical junctures in the care of an LTC resident, in terms of both resource utilization and quality of life, is when the need arises to make a decision about whether or not to hospitalize the individual. From the increasing amount of information available about these decision points, it is frequently argued that treatment options should be based on where the key decision makers (resident, family, physician, and staff) either explicitly or implicitly place the resident on a living-dying trajectory, such as the one in  Fig. 1 . In other words, more than just the immediate clinical condition of the resident guides interpretations of what comprises "good" or "harmful," appropriate or inappropriate treatment options. Fig. 1  is a schematic representation of this living–dying trajectory with an additional refinement that adds treatment modalities, including palliative and hospice care, to the righthand side of the figure across from the corresponding intervals in the trajectory. This updated schematic was used to guide our conceptualization of data collection procedures, selection of data analysis techniques, and the interpretation of the results of a project that studied the last year of life for a group of residents in institutional long-term care.As depicted in  Fig. 1 , acute care is compatible with a need for blended care early in the living–dying interval and may include hospitalization or other aggressive care. As the individual's condition progresses toward the dying interval, transitional care is used to move from curative care treatment to a plan of palliation for comfort and symptom management. The living–dying interval ends with a commitment to and a plan for palliation with symptom management. Therefore, high rates of hospitalization among residents who are established in palliation and/or hospice treatment modalities would represent potential inconsistencies between actions and prevailing recommendations about palliation and LTC. It should be noted that at no time is "no care" an acceptable standard of care in this schematic. Rather, the mode of care changes as the resident's condition changes from living through the process of actively dying, in which body functions are beginning to decline and ultimately shut down as death approaches.When frameworks such as the one shown in  Fig. 1  are well understood by treatment teams and family members, dramatic reductions in hospital deaths and enhanced end-of-life care in the nursing facility have been reported (Ackermann and Kemle 1999   ). Unfortunately, neither the term palliative care nor the associated approaches to care have been well integrated into most LTC facilities. Indeed, from our review of more than 225 journal articles and book chapters, the barriers to fully implementing high-quality, comprehensive palliation in LTC are better documented in the literature than are reports of successful end-of-life programs.Among other things, the current regulatory climate in LTC settings causes some providers to fear that they will not be seen by nursing home surveyors as sufficiently aggressive in their care if they allow a resident to decline without intervention (Meier and Morrison 1999   ). Prognostications and end-of-life staging continue to be difficult and inexact, especially for noncancerous, LTC residents whose progression from curative care to palliation requires a blended type of care for some period of time (Blatt 1999   ; Casarett and Karlawish 1999   ; Pendley and White 1999   ; Smith 1998   ; Zoloth-Dorfman 1998   ). Further confounding the problem is failure of care teams, especially physician members, to know and to document the wishes of residents and/or responsible decision makers, and to make the mutually agreed upon goals of treatment clear in the written plans of care (Lawhorne 1999   ; Levin et al. 1999   ). In addition, some practitioners worry that offering palliative care to a resident and the family may be misinterpreted as "no care" and are hesitant to discuss transitions from curative care to palliative care with a focus on symptom management (Mann and Welk 1997   ). Finally, families and their residents are often reluctant to have frank and open discussions of treatment preferences in advance of the need for action. Even when discussions do occur, an unwillingness by one or more parties to accept palliation as the treatment mode can abort even the most well intended efforts to provide high-quality end-of-life experiences (Dubler 1995   ; Roberto 1999   ; vonGuten and Twaddle 1996   ).Of course, physicians, other members of the care planning teams, families, and the residents themselves all make judgments about the degree of futility associated with curative care regardless of whether a palliative care philosophy can be clearly articulated or the term "palliative care" is even well understood. On any given day these judgments may be of little consequence to routine care plan decisions. But when critical events occur, the ways in which key decision makers have come to think about the futility of curative care, assessed beneficence, and placed the resident on the living–dying trajectory (as depicted in  Fig. 1 ) influence the decisions that are made (McCue 1995   ; Zuckerman 1999   ). If there is inconsistency or dissonance, these situations need to be better understood. Methods Design A retrospective study design that included medical chart reviews and the creation of case summaries for a group of recently deceased residents was used. In order to place the events of the residents' last years of life in the context of the entire institutional histories, the complete medical record was used to review each resident's entire length of stay. Institutional Review Board approval for the study was obtained from the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Setting and Sample The cooperating organization was a private, nonprofit continuing care retirement community (CCRC) in the southwestern United States. The community consisted of 20 duplexes, 209 apartments for independent living, a 45-bed assisted living center, and a 60-bed nursing facility, which was the focus of this investigation. Most of the residents in the nursing facility were life-care residents of the retirement community. Occasionally, residents were admitted from outside the CCRC on a private-pay basis. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement were not accepted by the facility.The sample consisted of 41 nursing home residents who died during the 18-month period January 1, 1998, to June 30, 1999. Deceased residents ranged in age from 76 to 102 (mean = 87). Consistent with other institutionalized populations, they were predominately female (85.3%) and widowed (85.4%). Fully 61% had a diagnosis of dementia on their medical records. The residents in the sample were in care on the nursing unit from as little as 2 days to as many as 3,114 days until death occurred either in the facility or in a hospital (mean = 704, median = 390). Most of the residents (90.2%) had advance directives on the chart. The person to be called in case of emergency was usually an adult daughter or son (75.6%). In all but four cases, these same individuals were listed as the responsible party for the residents' care and also held Durable Power of Attorney for decisions regarding the residents' health care. Eighty-five percent of these responsible parties lived in state. Four residents were listed as their own responsible party and were considered capable of making decisions for themselves. Data Collection Both quantitative (Phase 1) and qualitative (Phase 2) methods of data collection were used.  Table 1  displays the phases and steps included in the data collection procedures. The initial data collection process took between 45 minutes and 3.5 hours for each case, which was a reflection of the range in lengths of stay and number of hospitalizations.Phase 1 consisted of two steps. First, the data retrieval tool was pretested using the medical records of three residents who were currently in care. Next, quantitative data were collected from the records of the deceased residents for the last year of life or the entire length of time in the nursing home, if less than one year. The information included the resident's demographic characteristics, functional status, medical conditions, medication histories, and hospitalization data for each hospitalization.Phase 2 consisted of three steps. First, the full set of "notes" was reviewed to develop an overview of the resident's general course of care and to identify critical events, defined as acute changes in the resident's condition or circumstances that required changes in the plans of care. Elements of the course of care that were noted included: (1) documented exchanges among residents, their family members, the resident's physician, and the staff regarding care issues (personalized care, quality of care, agreement about specific treatment decisions); (2) the timing of advance directives and individuals cited in the medical records during any decision-making times; and (3) trends in the resident's decline over time (e.g., spontaneous, rapid or progressive, linear or stair-step). Critical events included, but were not limited to, changes in the resident's medical condition. For example, the death of a spouse who was the resident's responsible party and the need for an adult child to become the primary decision maker, as noted in the social service notes, was recorded as a critical event.In the second step of Phase 2, the date of entry for each critical event was used to guide a second reading of notes that were written before and after the critical event in order to gain the perspectives of all members of the care team. Questions guiding this reading included the following: Did other team members seem to be aware of the event? Was it an event that affected the care provided by other team members? Were there any new or conflicting perspectives on the event from other team members? The resident's final critical event, the death experience, was reviewed in detail. Specific attention was given to evidence of symptom management, inclusion of end-of-life issues in the interdisciplinary plan of care, the level of involvement of family members and professional caregivers at the end of life, and conflicted decision making (parties who did not agree with or expressed concern about decisions) that may have taken place around the time of death.Phase 2 concluded with the development of a written case summary from the Phase 2 information that represented the context of the resident's end-of-life story. These written summaries were presented to the nursing facility's interdisciplinary team for review. Time was set aside during the regular weekly meetings of the team for this purpose. As a group, the team members read each summary one at a time, commented on any relevant memories they had of the resident's care, and verified the accuracy of the summaries. Operationalizing Palliative Care Because "palliative care" is a term that is not in common use and specific criteria for operationalizing the variable for LTC populations do not exist, a method for determining whether or not a resident was either explicitly or implicitly in a palliative care mode had to be created from existing chart information. We selected criteria that could justify limiting aggressive curative care, such as evidence of functional decline with no rehabilitation potential, and would support decisions for comfort care and symptom management. In addition, a "do not resuscitate" (DNR) order was deemed an essential criterion because without such an order, aggressive treatment (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, activation of 911, and transfer to the hospital) would have been required regardless of any other implicit or explicit evidence of the futility of such intervention that we might have found in the medical record.Briefly, a resident was classified in palliative care if he/she had a DNR order on the chart and at least one of the following entered in the medical record in the 12 months preceding death: (a) a medical order for hospice (explicit palliative care), (b) a physician's note stating that the resident and/or responsible party understands that cure is not possible and requests "comfort care" (explicit palliative care), (c) evidence in the interdisciplinary plan of care that the resident's prognosis was poor and recovery was not an expected outcome (implicit palliative care), or (d) a progress note by the physician and/or an occupational or physical therapist stating that the resident's rehabilitation potential was "poor" (implicit palliative care).Because the exact wording of entries in the medical records tended to deviate slightly from the language in the operational definition, the investigators performed a coding reliability check for each case. For this step, the first two authors reviewed the verbatim documentation retrieved from the medical records and independently determined if the case met the criteria for palliative care. They agreed with each other's coding decisions 100% of the time. Analysis Quantitative data analysis initially consisted of descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Once the reliability of the case summaries was established, content analysis of the case summaries enabled us to explore possible inconsistencies between treatment modalities and care decisions. Because we were interested in who was involved with care decisions, especially decisions to hospitalize, part of the analyses of these data looked at the concept of caregiver coalitions in long-term care. The term "caregiver coalitions" has been used to describe the shift from a traditional dyadic relationship of client–provider to a new triad of client–provider–family that is needed as individuals become increasingly dependent (Caplow 1968   ; Coe and Pendergast 1985   ). This metaparadigm, or global framework (Fawcett 1984   ), was used to help the team focus on who was communicating with whom about care decisions in the last year of life. Access to both quantitative and qualitative data about the residents was important because it allowed the team to move back and forth from inductive to deductive reasoning and to test hunches as we worked with the data. A strategy that we labeled "concept tables" was used to display the concepts of interest (conflicted vs nonconflicted hospital admissions, types of hospital admissions, and caregiver coalitions) with selected resident characteristics. Chi-square tests of independence and t tests were used to test "hunches" about possible associations among the variables, as suggested by the existing literature and our work with the qualitative data. Results Hospitalization Prevalence and Incidence Rates Slightly less than half of the deceased residents (46.3%, n = 19) were admitted to the hospital, for a total of 27 separate admissions, during their last 12 months of life. Two thirds (68%, n = 13) of these residents experienced one admission, 21% (n = 4) were admitted twice, and 11% (n = 2) had three admissions during the 12 months preceding death. In addition to this inpatient care, 26.8% of the total sample (n = 11) had between one and three visits to the emergency room in the last 12 months of life that did not result in hospitalization. Falls with minor injury (lacerations, rib fractures) were the primary reason for these outpatient contacts.The reasons for the hospital admissions included three broad categories: accidental injury (e.g., fractured hip; 15%, 4 admissions), acute conditions (52%, 14 admissions), and conditions related to end-stage chronic disease (33%, 9 admissions). Over half of the admissions for acute conditions were pneumonia-related. Cardiopulmonary failure represented the vast majority (66%) of the chronic care admissions. There were no statistically significant differences in age or weight loss, a classic clinical indicator of terminal decline, between residents who were hospitalized and those who were not. In order to see if having a diagnosis of dementia, implying reliance on others for care decisions, made any difference in hospitalization patterns, we compared the number of hospital stays for the two groups of residents. The demented residents had somewhat higher rates of hospitalization in the last year of life than their nondemented counterparts (t test = −1.53, p = .067). Palliative Care Modalities For the total sample, the overwhelming majority of the residents (87%, n = 35) satisfied the operational definition for palliative care within the last 12 months of life. These residents died in palliative care modes ranging in length of time from 2 days to 284 days. About one third of the hospitalized residents (37%, n = 7) were in palliative care modes at the time a decision to hospitalize was made. Forty-two percent of the hospitalized residents entered palliative care modes following their hospital discharges.The hospitalization experience was an important trigger for hospice care. About two thirds (63%, n = 12) of the hospitalized residents were discharged with orders for hospice care or were approved for hospice care within 6 months of their last hospitalizations. For one half of this group of residents, the hospice order was the first evidence of a shift to palliative care in the year preceding death. Clearly, a large percentage of residents from LTC were being provided aggressive hospital care. Returning to our initial conceptualization of a living–dying continuum for permanently placed residents in long-term care, it seemed possible that at least some of these cases might represent the cognitive dissonance currently surrounding palliative care and end-of-life care for LTC residents (Zuckerman 1999   ). In an effort to better understand the hospitalization patterns identified in the sample, we turned to the case summaries. The Decision To Hospitalize A defining feature of effective caregiver triads is open communication among all members. Therefore, our analysis focused on the decisions, actions, and interactions of the members of the triad in order to understand decisions to hospitalize. After reviewing all summaries, it became clear that the hospitalized cases fell into two distinct groups. One group was labeled "nonconflicted" admissions and the other group as "conflicted" admissions. Among the nonconflicted admissions, we found no evidence of disagreement about the admission decision among any of the coalition members. The physician ordered the hospital admission for either accidental injury or acute illness situations (usually respiratory infection), and there was no evidence of contradictory wishes by the residents, family, or other responsible parties. These admissions represented about 47% of the hospital cases (n = 9).We were surprised to find that 55% (n = 5) of the residents experiencing nonconflicted admissions fit the palliative care definition at the time of hospital admission. Their reasons for admissions represented a mix of accidental and acute conditions, both of which could justify hospitalization. In addition, based on the dates at which each resident met the palliative care definition, and was hospitalized, we determined that most of these residents had recently segued to palliative care (6 months or less). These residents may still have been in blended care modes, a finding that offers preliminary validation for the inclusion of blended care in the schematic. The extent to which the long-term care environment may have had limits on the availability of certain types of care that might have been used to provide for adequate symptom management in lieu of a hospital stay could not be determined from the chart reviews.The remaining 53% (n = 10) of the hospitalized cases included three distinct groups of conflicted cases, all of which stemmed from the actions or inactions of the individual members of the caregiver coalition. Eighty percent (n = 8) of the conflicted cases were not in palliative care modes at the time of hospitalization, although all but one of the cases were in palliative care at the time of death. Ninety percent of the conflicted cases died within 6 months of their last hospital stay. Three scenarios summarize the conflicted cases.In the first scenario, representing 30% (n = 3) of the conflicted cases, the resident's primary care physician was out of town or not on call when the resident's condition became unstable and the decision to hospitalize had to be made. In the absence of explicit written instructions on the chart about hospital care or the general goals of care, the physician or physician's assistant on call opted to send the resident to the hospital. Thus, the physician/LTC staff comprised the weak link at a critical decision-making juncture.In the second scenario, consisting of 30% (n = 3) of the conflicted cases, a nuclear family member (most often an adult child) was the resident's responsible party. For reasons that were not apparent in the medical record, this person was not able to agree to or stay on a palliative care course, even when it was clear from the functional status of the resident that his or her condition was deteriorating. In each case, when the resident's condition became unstable, the responsible party was unable to forgo aggressive curative care and opted for hospitalization.The final set of conflicted cases (40%, n = 4) was represented by a scenario in which the responsible party who held power of attorney was either not a family member (friend or attorney) or was a member of the extended family (niece or nephew). There was very little, if any, documentation in the medical record (social services and physician's progress notes) about the resident's wishes for care. Despite dire medical conditions, none of these residents met the palliative care operational definition because their responsible parties consistently chose to "do everything possible." It was also the case that this group of residents appeared to be the most vulnerable for tumultuous end-of-life experiences. Two of these cases had multiple hospital stays the last year of life and two of the residents died without benefit of hospice care, family, or friends at their bedside. All of the residents in this subgroup died in the hospital or within one month of discharge. When Hospitalization Is Not the Choice Our analysis then turned to a review of the nonhospitalized residents' case summaries. The most outstanding contrast between hospitalized and nonhospitalized residents was the documentation on the medical records clearly stating the wishes of the resident and/or the family for end-of-life care and hospital decisions. Letters were often found in the medical record from family members that stipulated "no transfer" orders. The care planning team documented the presence of family members at care planning conferences and their explicit wishes for no hospital care. Physicians' notes tended to detail conversations with family members and the resident, when possible, about the course of care that would be followed, even for those residents who appeared to be in blended or transitional care. As might be expected, 81.8% of the nonhospitalized residents eventually died in hospice care compared to 58% of the hospitalized residents.In summary, the hallmarks of care among the nonhospitalized cases were: open communication between all decision makers (family, physician, staff, and resident when possible); knowledge of the residents' wishes by a responsible party; physician and staff commitment to following the wishes of the residents and families; explicit notes in the medical records about care decisions; and a commitment to stay the course of care. These findings were combined with the caregiving metaparadigm and prior research, especially the insights of Ackermann and Kemle 1999   , to create the preliminary conceptual model for providing end-of-life care in LTC settings (see  Fig. 2 ).The solid arrows in the middle of the  Fig. 2  represent the open communication that typifies the basic caregiver coalition in LTC. Ideally, all members of the coalition are active participants in the decision-making process. However, as our results demonstrated, there are certain tasks that are largely the responsibility of one member of the coalition and that most directly affect the behavior of another member of the coalition as the need for managing end-of-life care approaches. Therefore, while the center arrows represent simultaneous interaction among the triad members, the outside arrows and the associated callout boxes are intended to represent directional patterns of responsibility for effective end-of-life care.Recently, it was reported that nearly one half of nursing home transfers to hospitals may be inappropriate, based on interpretations by expert physician panels regarding the chief complaint on admission and the clinical care that was required in combination with the presence of an advance directive (Saliba et al. 2000   ). We believe that our present study and this earlier work may have also identified a subset of LTC residents whose hospitalizations may have been avoided. However, in our study we base that determination on a belief that one or more of the critical elements in  Fig. 2  may have been lacking. Further research on the appropriateness of nursing home transfers that combine clinical indicators (e.g., Saliba et al. 2000   ), location on the living–dying trajectory, and the responsibility assigned to each member of the triad in  Fig. 2  may improve our understanding of why some LTC residents are hospitalized and others in similar circumstances are not. Discussion As LTC residents move through living–dying intervals, the current standards by which their care is evaluated have often resulted in murky decision making regarding such issues as aggressive acute care, transitions to palliative care, and the timing of hospice orders. A great deal of prior research has focused on clinical indicators to explain decisions to hospitalize LTC residents. As a result, authors frequently discuss the need for enhanced medical monitoring and supervision in LTC facilities. In large part these studies have ignored the need to identify residents' placements on a living–dying trajectory, opting instead to apply active treatment standards and curative goals to the residents' plans of care.In this study we chose to search for implicit or explicit evidence that key decision makers and influential others had placed residents in palliative modes of care. We then examined their course of care in the last year of life from this perspective, searched for inconsistencies between the modes of care and subsequent hospitalization decisions, and sought to untangle some of the contextual variables that supported or interfered with care decisions and the provision of end-of-life care.Recently, the issuing of DNR orders 24 hours or more after hospital admission has been called "medical last rites" (DeJonge, Sulmasy, and Gold 1999   ). Hospitalization may represent a similar message of futility and finality to families of LTC residents who are known to have tendencies toward delaying end-of-life discussions and agreement on appropriate care (Happ et al. 1999   ; Wilson and Daley 1999   ). Unfortunately, when hospitalization is the trigger event for end-of-life care planning, little time is left for appropriate end-of-life preparation and palliative care.From these results it is apparent that many LTC residents need more clearly defined palliative plans in advance of the need to decide about hospital care. If, as we have suggested, hospitalization and subsequent orders for hospice care fit the concept of medical last rites, then one needed change is to find better ways of helping families understand the futility of treatment and to recognize a need for a shift to palliative goals of care. To this end, the model in  Fig. 2  is offered as a springboard for additional research on effective programs of end-of-life care. As research programs continue to mature, it is likely that other elements will be added and that cause-and-effect relationships will be clarified. For example, the influence of prevailing public policy and related reimbursement issues pertaining to end-of-life care in LTC settings (Petrisek and Mor 1999   ) were not immediately apparent in the present study of private-pay, life-care retirement community residents of high socioeconomic circumstances. Both the generalizability of the study results and the applicability of the model across long-term care populations are affected by our small sample size and the study setting.We close with acknowledgment of our rather crude operational definition of palliative care and a call for greater attention to ways in which clinicians and researchers can measure this important concept of care. Prognosticating an individual's ability to survive 6 months or less for purposes of implementing a hospice plan is widely recognized as a very difficult task. But until diagnosticians are able and willing to make these determinations, other members of the care planning teams, family members, and the care recipients will invariably struggle to find direction and make informed decisions about end-of-life care. A significant area for future research will be better delineation of inevitable transitions in care among residents in LTC and the role of palliation treatment goals and hospice care during the final transition to death.CorrectionIn an article on retirement preparedness that appeared in the December 2000 issue (vol. 40, no. 6), Hershey and Mowen reported a series of correlations in  Table 1  (page 692). Due to a transcription error by the authors, incorrect valences were reported for 14 of the values contained in that table. The actual valences for all values in column three and row three of the table (involving the variable "emotional stability") should be reversed; positive values are actually negative, and negative values are actually positive. This error did not affect either the structural modeling analyses the authors describe, nor the conclusions they draw in the text.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose:This study examined organizational and market factors associated with nursing homes that are most likely to be early adopters of innovations. Early adopter institutions, defined as the first 20% of facilities to adopt an innovation, are important because they subsequently facilitate the diffusion of innovations to others in the industry.Design and Methods:Two groups of innovations were examined, special care units and subacute care services. I used discrete-time logistic regression analysis and nationally representative data from 13,162 facilities at risk of being early adopters of innovations during twelve 6-month intervals from 1992 to 1997.Results:Organizational factors that increase the likelihood of early innovation adoption are larger bed size, chain membership, and high levels of private-pay residents. Four market factors that increase the likelihood of early innovation adoption are: a retrospective Medicaid reimbursement methodology, a more competitive environment, higher average income in the county, and a higher number of hospital beds in the county.Implications:This analysis shows that organizational and market characteristics of nursing homes affect their propensity toward early adoption of innovations. Some of the results may be useful for nursing home administrators and policy makers attempting to promote innovation.   Market factors ,  On-line Survey and Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR) ,  Organizational factors Laurence G. Branch, PhDIn comparison to the rather substantial literature in the hospital industry, there is a paucity of research examining innovation in the nursing home industry; therefore, there is an urgent need to facilitate and understand innovation in this setting. Nursing homes are often criticized for their poor quality of care. Press reports (Consumer Reports 1995   ), empirical research (e.g., Davis 1991   ; Ray, Federspiel, and Schaffner 1980   ), and the federal government's own assessment of nursing homes generally note endemic quality problems (Institute of Medicine 1986   ; General Accounting Office 1998   , General Accounting Office 1999a   , General Accounting Office 1999b   , General Accounting Office 1999c   ). Clearly, quality of care is influenced by many factors, but as evidenced by the experience of the hospital industry, innovation has the potential to improve quality in some areas of care (Shortell et al. 1995   ). With little research examining innovation in the nursing home industry, the link between innovation and improved quality in these facilities is less developed but is often assumed to exist. For example, innovations such as total quality management (TQM), computerization of medical records, and use of specialized care settings may improve quality (Banaszak-Holl, Zinn, and Mor 1996   ; Castle and Banaszak-Holl 1997   ). This study examined organizational and market factors associated with the early adoption of innovations in nursing homes.Early adopter institutions are defined as the first 20% of facilities to adopt an innovation (Rogers 1983   ). Although the initial adoption of an innovation within most industries is characteristically sluggish, these so-called early adopters may subsequently facilitate its diffusion throughout the industry (Rogers 1983   ). Thus, identifying characteristics associated with this early adoption process could be useful in further facilitating the diffusion of innovations in the nursing home setting. However, innovation diffusion is influenced by multiple factors. These factors include changes in the competitive environment, profit potential, and regulation. Diffusion may also simply be a copycat, symbolic, or emotional phenomenon (Abrahamson 1991   ; Scott 1990   ). In this investigation organizational and market characteristics are examined: first, because they are often under the purview of legislators; second, because an organization's adoption of an innovation is highly dependent upon its own characteristics and the nature of the market (Mansfield 1968   ). As some authors have pointed out, organizational and market factors are of primary importance as "determinants of innovation" (Attewell 1992   ; Damanpour 1991   ).A variety of operational definitions of innovation exist. For example, one definition is whether the innovation was created within the organization (Aiken and Hage 1971   ). Another common way to operationalize innovation is to focus on practices that are new to the organization adopting them (Hage and Dewar 1973   ). As Daft 1982   (p. 131) describes, "the idea can be either new or old in comparison to other organizations so long as the idea has not been previously used by the adopting organization"; this is the definition of innovation used in this investigation.Results of analyses using single innovations may be idiosyncratic and raise questions of generalizability (Kimberly and Evanisko 1981   ). Studying more than one innovation increases the chance that the role of the organizational and market characteristics will be robust (Damanpour 1991   ). I examined the startup of two groups of innovations, special care units and subacute care services, which together consist of 13 possible innovations.Special care units are beds identified by a facility for residents with specific needs or diagnoses. This group of innovations includes beds for patients with Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, dialysis, head trauma, Huntington's disease, ventilators, hospice, and special rehabilitation (Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], 1992; Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ), all of which are included in my analyses. Special care units in nursing homes are an emergent trend (Freiman and Brown 1999   ); for example, the number of special care hospice units in nursing homes increased by over 100% from 1992 to 1997 (On-line Survey and Certification of Automated Records [OSCAR], 1992–1997), making these units suitable for early innovation analyses.Innovations in subacute services commonly include physical rehabilitation, intravenous (IV) therapy, wound management, cardiac treatment, and dialysis, all of which are included in my analyses. Initially, these services were offered primarily by nursing facilities that provided care to Medicare recipients because these residents were more likely to be recovering from an acute illness necessitating these modalities of care (Intrator, Castle, and Mor 1999   ). However, changes in technology have created a larger market for these services. Also, managed care plans are increasingly forging links with nursing homes that provide subacute care. Thus, the provision of these services has recently become more common, making subacute services suitable for early innovation analyses with the 1992–1997 data used in this investigation. Background From an examination of both the health care and management literature for research adding to my understanding of innovation in nursing homes, only three studies were identified. First, in a Delphi study, innovations considered most important by nursing home administrators were major facility-wide shifts such as vertical integration and managed care, in addition to intraorganizational changes such as flexible staff scheduling and computerization (Brannon, Castle, Callaway, and Zinn 1995   ). It is also interesting to note that, in its first wave of deliberations, the Delphi panel identified more than 40 innovations in nursing homes. This is in stark contrast to the custodial care usually associated with these institutions.Banaszak-Holl and colleagues 1996    examined the impact of six market characteristics (HMO penetration, number of hospital beds, Medicare hospital discharges, market competition, regulatory policies, and Medicaid reimbursement rate) and three organizational characteristics (Medicare census, bed size, and profit status) on the provision of Alzheimer's and subacute special care units. The authors found significant results for five of these nine factors, leading them to state that special care units are partly a response to a growing demand by resource providers' and facilities' attempts to maintain a competitive edge in their markets.More recently, Castle and Banaszak-Holl 1997    examined how the demographic characteristics of the top management team in 236 nursing homes can affect the adoption of innovations. The innovation examined was the computerization of the Minimum Data Set (MDS), and characteristics investigated were tenure, education, and involvement in a professional society. The results were generally significant for each of these factors. However, the results for top managers of nonchain nursing homes showed a greater association between demographic factors and innovation than the results for top managers of nursing homes belonging to a chain.The lack of studies addressing innovation in nursing homes may not be problematic if research from other areas within the health care arena can be applied to this setting. Although there is a substantial body of innovation research set in hospitals (e.g., Kimberly and Evanisko 1981   ; Meyer and Goes 1988   ), the nursing home industry is dissimilar from the hospital industry in several ways that may have a significant influence on the adoption of innovations (Kimberly and Evanisko 1981   ). These factors include: staffing characteristics such as top management turnover and education; numbers and types of clinical staff; organizational characteristics such as size, profit status, and patient mix; and market characteristics such as levels of competition and regulatory stringency. Hypotheses Organizational Factors When attempting to change, small organizations have modest margins of error because they have fewer available resources and are more likely to go out of business than larger organizations (Hannan and Freeman 1977   ). This has been referred to as the "liability of smallness" (Gifford and Mullner 1988   ) and may be why facility size is an important correlate of innovation. For example, hospitals with fewer beds are less likely to innovate (Kimberly and Evanisko 1981   ). I hypothesize that small nursing homes will also innovate conservatively, and propose:Hypothesis 1: Small nursing homes are less likely to be early adopters of innovations.The organizational goals and resultant behavior of for-profit and not-for-profit providers may be dissimilar (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ; Holmes 1996   ; Koetting 1980   ). For-profit nursing homes are often seen as profit oriented, and as a result may be less aggressive in implementing costly resident care services (Davis 1991   ; Greene and Monahan 1981   ; Koetting 1980   ; Spector and Takada 1991   ). Not-for-profit nursing homes are often seen as more altruistic and as a result may be more aggressive in implementing resident care services, irrespective of costs (Davis 1991   ; Greene and Monahan 1981   ; Koetting 1980   ; Spector and Takada 1991   ). These differences in mission are likely to be reflected in the types of innovations adopted by the two organizational forms. Not-for-profit facilities are likely to adopt innovations that facilitate better resident care, such as special care units and subacute care. Thus, I propose:Hypothesis 2: Not-for-profit nursing homes are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Chain membership may promote innovation. For example, chain membership was associated with a greater likelihood that a nursing home would adopt a computerized information system (Castle and Banaszak-Holl 1997   ). Facilities that are part of a chain may have access to capital, along with other resources that may help facilitate innovation. Corporate management may also disseminate successful innovations among member facilities once they are seen to be viable in pilot facilities. Therefore, I hypothesize:Hypothesis 3: Nursing homes that are members of chains are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.The majority of persons in nursing homes are Medicaid recipients. The Medicaid program, due to budget constraints, provides lower reimbursement to nursing homes compared to private-pay residents. As a consequence, it may be difficult for facilities to provide adequate services (Kim 1990   ; Wagner 1987   , Wagner 1988   ). Indeed, there is some indication that the Medicaid program may be paying less than costs in some states (Kim 1990   ; Wagner 1987   , Wagner 1988   ). To avoid dependence on this public program, many nursing homes have focused on the private-pay market because they have greater latitude in establishing the price of services they provide to these residents. Nursing homes may be more able to innovate when they cater to private-pay residents. I hypothesize:Hypothesis 4: Nursing homes with more private-pay residents are more likely to be early adopters of innovations. Market Factors States have some degree of flexibility in establishing their methodologies for Medicaid payment (Buchanan, Madel, and Persons 1991   ). Some of these are more restrictive than others. Facilities operating under retrospective methodologies are reimbursed for actual costs incurred, whereas prospective payment is more likely to pay a pre-set flat rate. From a nursing home's perspective, prospective reimbursement is more stringent than retrospective reimbursement (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). Facilities operating under retrospective reimbursement may be more able to innovate than those operating under prospective reimbursement because of these higher reimbursement levels. I hypothesize:Hypothesis 5: Nursing homes operating in markets with retrospective Medicaid reimbursement are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Some states have focused on containing the supply of nursing home beds as a strategy aimed at controlling their Medicaid costs. Common methods of constricting the bed supply include Certificate of Need (CON) legislation and new construction moratoria. For potential providers these limitations are a barrier to entry into these markets (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ); but, the reduced bed supply increases the demand for existing nursing homes' services (Cohen and Dubay 1990   ). As a result, facilities that already provide care in these markets may be less inclined to innovate because of a greater proportion of residents with need for traditional nursing home care. Therefore, I hypothesize:Hypothesis 6: Nursing homes operating in markets with CON legislation or new construction moratoria are less likely to be early adopters of innovations.Environments vary in their degree of competitiveness. Pfeffer and Salancik 1978    argue that organizations share a limited pool of resources in more competitive environments and that survival depends on organizational effectiveness. Furthermore, in more competitive environments, nursing homes have the incentive to differentiate their services in order to improve their image in the marketplace. The use of innovations can help to increase both organizational effectiveness and differentiate services. One source of competition is from other nursing homes. Therefore, I propose:Hypothesis 7: Nursing homes operating in competitive nursing home markets are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Nursing homes also compete with providers in other sectors of the health care industry. For example, hospitals provide a variety of long-term care services to the elderly population, on both an inpatient and outpatient basis (Muramatsu, Lee, and Alexander 2000   ). Services such as hospital-based geriatric care units increased from 666 in 1990 to 709 in 1993. Likewise, hospital hospice services increased from 868 to 1,082, and geriatric clinics from 461 to 537 in the same period (American Hospital Association 1991   , American Hospital Association 1994   ). Thus, following Hypothesis 7, I propose:Hypothesis 8:Nursing homes operating in markets with hospital-sponsored outpatient long-term care services are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Hypothesis 9: Nursing homes operating in markets with hospital-sponsored inpatient long-term care services are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.In each market, the abundance of resources available to organizations can vary. In some markets, resources are relatively abundant, or munificent (Staw and Szwajkowski 1975   ); as a result, nursing homes may have greater access to resources that would allow them to innovate. Among the more important resources for long-term care providers are the number of elderly persons, average income, and the number of hospital beds in the market.Elderly people (over the age of 65) are the primary recipients of nursing home services, so an area with a high proportion of such individuals is munificent from the perspective of market growth potential. In markets with higher per capita income, the private-pay segment is likely to be larger. Finally, nursing homes are also dependent on discharges from hospitals, suggesting that in areas with more hospital beds the environment is likely to be more munificent. Therefore, it follows:Hypothesis 10: Nursing homes operating in markets with many elderly people are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Hypothesis 11: Nursing homes operating in markets with higher incomes are more likely to be early adopters of innovations.Hypothesis 12:Nursing homes operating in markets with many hospital beds are more likely to be early adopters of innovations. Methods Sources of Data The data used in this investigation came from two sources: (1) the 1992–1997 On-line Survey and Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR) and (2) the 1999 Area Resource File (ARF). The OSCAR is conducted by state licensure and certification agencies as part of the Medicare/Medicaid certification process, and includes approximately 15,455 facilities in 1992 and 16,533 in 1997.Those facilities that are neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified (approximately 800 in 1992 and 1,000 in 1997) are not included in the OSCAR data. This may have some impact on the representativeness of my results; but clearly, in the absence of data and previous research on these nursing homes, I am unable to determine whether these facilities are early adopters of innovations.There are approximately 300 data elements in the OSCAR, the majority of which are either organizational or aggregate resident data. Organizational data relevant to this study include bed size, chain membership, ownership, and the number of nursing personnel (by job category and full-time equivalent [FTE] status). Resident data relevant to this study include dependence/independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and the number of residents by payer category.Much of the OSCAR data are self-reported by the nursing home administrator and director of nursing. Interrater reliability testing has not been performed for the data as a whole, and such biases are generally unknown, although in prior analyses I compared primary data with many items overlapping with those in the OSCAR collected from more than 400 nursing homes and found very high correlation. This was not unexpected given that it is doubtful whether often stable facility factors such as ownership, chain membership, or bed size are subject to reporting bias because these factors are often found on business records (e.g., purchase orders, letterhead, advertisements) readily available to surveyors. In addition, most data elements pertaining to resident characteristics are verified by the surveyors. Thus, it is not surprising that these data are widely used as a secondary source of nursing home characteristics.The OSCAR data can be limited because the information in the surveyors' report is pertinent only for the time they make rounds in the facility, usually occurring during the day shift. Twenty-four-hour observation by the surveyors in each facility is not possible. Care practices, such as physical restraint use, may be biased in analyses because other shifts may not follow day shift practices (Castle 2000   ). I have no reason to believe that the variables used in this analysis (e.g., census, bed size, or facility ownership) are biased in this way.The 1999 ARF data are compiled from a number of sources, including the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual hospital survey, the U.S. Census of Population and Housing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS; Stambler 1988   ). These data are at the county level and are commonly used in health services research (e.g., Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ; Castle and Banaszak-Holl 1997   ; Nyman 1987   ). In this investigation the ARF was used to measure the number of outpatient long-term care facilities, number of hospital-based long-term care services, number of elderly subjects, and average income in the county in which the nursing home is located. The 1999 data include these figures from the 1980s through 1996. The OSCAR data generally contain information from the prior year. Therefore, I was able to match the OSCAR and ARF with presumably little measurement error. Variables I used a single binary variable created from two groups of innovations—special care units and subacute care services. As shown in  Table 1  , together these consist of 13 possible innovations.In addition to the 13 independent variables of interest described in the hypotheses, 5 additional variables are included in the analysis as controls. These variables have been shown to be important covariates in other studies of innovation and/or important in studies examining the behavior of nursing homes. They include: caregiver staffing levels of RNs, LPNs, and nurse aides; an average ADL score representing residents' acuity in each facility; and average occupancy. When high caregiver staffing levels are prevalent, more time may be available to implement innovations (Kimberly and Evanisko 1981   ); conversely, in facilities with high average ADL scores, less caregiver time may be available to implement innovations. Facilities with high average occupancy rates may have more available resources to innovate (Nyman 1987   ). Table 1  shows how the variables are operationalized and, where applicable, the coding for the analysis is included. With the exception of the Herfindahl index and Medicaid reimbursement, these variables are self-evident. The Herfindahl index is a measure of how competitive a market is in which a facility is located. Following a number of studies, the county was considered to be the market (Castle and Banaszak-Holl 1997   ; Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). The index ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing a monopoly market, and lower values in cases where there are many homes each with a small share of the market (White and Chirikos 1988   ). A dummy variable identifying whether a facility receives either retrospective or prospective reimbursement under the Medicaid program is included. Facilities are reimbursed in varying degrees for actual costs under retrospective policies, but prospective Medicaid reimbursement methodologies provide lower payments to nursing homes than retrospective methodologies; therefore, I represent these payment methodologies as a dichotomous variable. Procedures and Limitations This analysis excludes hospital-based facilities and facilities that are part of a retirement center (n = 1,138) because they tend to be unrepresentative of other nursing homes in terms of staff, residents (Burns and Taube 1984   ), and organizational factors (Singh and Schwab 1998   ). For example, they are predominantly not-for-profit. These nursing homes may also have greater economies of scope and/or greater access to capital because of their partnership. Greater access to capital, along with other resources, may help facilitate innovation adoption in these facilities.Starting with the April 1992 OSCAR data, facilities identified as having one of the innovations were assigned a value of 1, and those identified as not having any of the innovations were assigned a value of 0. This process was repeated at 6-month intervals through to the April 1997 OSCAR data, giving an approximate time period during which each facility may have adopted the innovation. Six-month intervals were used because of the data available; thus, this is a time period of convenience and has no conceptual or theoretical importance. Other analyses using more frequent intervals would surely be a further refinement to my analyses.This approach has several disadvantages. First, data prior to 1992 were not available to me; thus, some of the early adopters are not truly matched to the facility and market factors at the time of innovation initiation. However, the development of the innovations investigated in this study has been rapid, so censoring (i.e., incomplete/unavailable data prior to 1992) represented only 2% of the early adopter sample. Indeed, in sensitivity analyses (not reported) excluding these facilities, the findings were robust. But clearly, I am still restricted to a sample of convenience, and these 2% of earliest adopters may be influenced by factors other than those I include in the analyses. For example, some innovation may be triggered by the Prospective Payment System (PPS) in hospitals, because this led to patients being discharged to nursing homes with greater acuity levels (Harrington and Carrillo 1999   ). However, the concept of "early" in adoption studies is generally regarded to encompass the initial 20% of adopters (Rogers 1983   ). Based on this, I believe that these earliest adopters do not compromise this study.A second limitation of this study is that some facilities are excluded from the sample because of difficulties matching nursing homes from year to year. This problem arises because nursing homes do not necessarily keep the same identification number, the primary source of facility identification. Nursing homes that change management, ownership, or location are often given new numbers. Other facilities may have closed or opened during the 5-year study period, leading to the loss of identification numbers and the creation of new identification numbers, respectively. For those facilities with unmatched identification numbers, matching algorithms by facility name, address, and ZIP code were used. Missing cases still occurred, and from the 1992 data approximately 8% (n = 1,107) of nursing homes were not represented in the analyses because they could not be identified in one of the subsequent data sources. Clearly, I am unable to determine the potential impact these missing data points have on the analyses. Some facilities may change management, ownership, or location because they are successful innovators, yet other facilities may undergo these same changes, or close, because they do not innovate.The analyses are less representative of facilities in the 1997 OSCAR. This is because the number of facilities included in the OSCAR has grown since 1992. Approximately 17% (n = 2,231) of nursing homes in the 1997 OSCAR were not represented in the analyses because they were not included in one of the prior data sources.There were very little missing data on any of the dependent or independent variables. Insufficient data were present in 48 cases for the dependent variables, resulting in an analytic sample of 13,162 facilities. In most cases, information for the independent variables in this analytic sample was available. Missing cases represented between 0%–2% for all of these variables, and less than 1% of facilities had any missing data. All missing values for continuous or ordinal variables were imputed using mean substitution. Dichotomous variables were randomly assigned 0 or 1 values according to the binomial distribution with a probability as observed for the complete cases (Maddala 1977   ). Other methods for dealing with missing data are available (see Little and Rubin 1987   ); because of the small number of facilities with any missing data, however, these methods are unlikely to be advantageous in my analyses. The results reported are robust in that imputation did not produce any significant change in my results compared to analyses performed prior to imputing missing data values.Common errors in the OSCAR data include approximately 2% of duplicate facilities and between 0%–4% of data with entry errors. Duplicate facilities were eliminated using the federal identification number and the survey date. When an identification number appeared more than once in the data, the information associated with the most recent survey date was used. If the survey dates were identical, one of the duplicate facility records was chosen randomly to be used in the analysis. Following the approach outlined by other researchers using these data, frequency distribution plots were used to identify obvious outliers (Castle and Fogel 1998   ). Imputation, as described above, was used to replace these data entry errors.To recap, 15,455 unduplicated nursing facilities are included at baseline in the 1992 OSCAR. I excluded hospital-based facilities and facilities that are part of a retirement center (n = 1,138). A further 1,107 facilities are lost to follow-up in the 1997 data and 48 have missing data, resulting in an analytic sample of 13,162 facilities. Analysis I analyzed the effect of these variables on nursing homes' adoption of the innovations of interest using discrete-time logit modeling. This method is appropriate for examining dichotomous dependent variables with longitudinal data (Yamaguchi 1992   ). Cross-sectional logit and probit models more simply characterize organizations as adopters and nonadopters, thereby suppressing information on the timing of innovation adoption (Lee and Waldman 1985   ). In my case, the advantage this regression technique has over these more commonly used cross-sectional models is the robust ability to account for right censoring and the large time intervals used. Right censoring occurs when the time of an event is unknown. For example, in this investigation the time of innovation adoption in unknown. A facility may adopt an innovation of interest at any time from 1992 to 1997, or it may not adopt any innovations of interest during this interval. The unit of analysis in the discrete-time logit modeling used in this analysis is the facility-interval, rather than the individual facility (or person) as would be used in ordinary regression models. Specifically, this is a nursing home 6-month interval. Because the data are only in 6-month increments, I cannot provide an unequivocal determination of the precise timing of an innovation; in cases such as these, logit modeling is preferred over continuous time models (Cox 1972   ) such as Cox proportional hazards (Ingram and Kleinman 1989   ; Yamaguchi 1992   ).The dependent variable of moving from the noninnovation state to the innovation state is a dichotomous variable (0,1). At every nursing home 6-month interval, this variable will be 1 if an innovation was observed and 0 if not. Logit models are recommended for use with such dichotomous dependent variables. Controlling for all of the variables in a model, they provide a robust test of significance. In evaluating the effects of these independent variables, odds ratios were calculated by taking the exponent of the parameter estimates on all variables.I also used generalized estimating equations (GEE; Zeger and Liang 1992   ). This was because biases can occur in data consisting of repeat observations. The biases are due to the potential correlation among the repeat observations and they can lead to elevated significance levels. GEE controls for the correlation due to repeat observations and provides more robust significance levels (Zeger and Liang 1992   ). It does so by separating the within-subject correlation from the regression coefficient estimations (Karim and Zeger 1988   ; Succi, Lee, and Alexander 1997   ). Results  Table 2  presents descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analysis that show there are several differences in organizational characteristics between early innovation adopter and nonadopter nursing homes. These differences include average bed size, profit status, chain membership, average private-pay census, and Medicaid occupancy. With regard to market characteristics,  Table 2  also shows differences in prospective Medicaid reimbursement and the average Herfindahl index score.Odds ratios and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the discrete-time logit regression model are presented in  Table 3  . The odds ratios indicate the proportion of change in the early innovation adoption rate when the independent variable increases by one unit. Odds ratios of 1 indicate that the variable had no effect, whereas values greater than 1 indicate a positive effect, and values less than 1 a negative effect (Demaris 1992   ). However, before discussing the effects of specific variables, it should be noted that with a chi square of 71 (p < .001) the overall goodness-of-fit of the model is statistically significant. It should also be noted that because of the large number of cases included in this study, statistically significant results are achieved with relatively small effect size.Eleven factors are significantly associated with early adopters. For the organizational characteristics, larger bed size (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.37; p < .01), chain membership (AOR 1.46; p < .01), and a higher percentage of private-pay residents (AOR 1.97; p < .001) increase the likelihood of early innovation adoption. In particular, facilities with a higher percentage of private-pay residents have almost twice the likelihood of early innovation adoption, and those with a larger bed size have 1.37 times the likelihood of early innovation adoption as do other facilities.With regard to market characteristics, prospective Medicaid reimbursement (AOR 0.67; p < .01) decreased the likelihood of early adoption of innovations. Facilities in areas with prospective Medicaid reimbursement have 0.33 times the likelihood of early innovation adoption as do other facilities. Facilities in areas with a higher Herfindahl index score (AOR 0.89; p < .01) decrease the likelihood of early adoption of innovations. Higher average income (AOR 1.09; p < .05) and higher numbers of hospital beds (AOR 1.11; p < .01) increase the likelihood of early adoption of innovations.The control factors FTE RNs/bed (AOR 1.74; p < .001), FTE LPNs/bed (AOR 1.11; p < .01), FTE nurse aides/bed (AOR 0.76; p > .01), and average occupancy (AOR 0.89; p < .01) are also significantly associated with the likelihood of early innovation adoption. Discussion This study examined organizational and market factors associated with nursing homes that are early adopters of innovations. As shown in  Table 4  I found support for 7 of the 12 hypotheses examining these factors. Specifically, organizational factors found to be significantly associated with early innovation adoption are bed size, chain membership, and percentage of private-pay residents. Market factors significantly associated with early innovation adoption are: Medicaid reimbursement methodology, the Herfindahl index score, average income in the county, and the number of hospital beds in the county.Several of these findings may be important to the nursing home industry. For example, Hypothesis 3, suggesting that nursing homes that are members of chains are more likely to be early adopters of innovations, is especially important. When a facility is a member of a chain, economies of scale can occur whereby chain members may have more resources available and therefore be more able to introduce innovations. Other research has indicated that these resource advantages are not necessarily channeled into resident care activities (Castle and Fogel 1998   ). This analysis shows that this may not always be the case.To avoid dependence on low Medicaid payments, many nursing homes have focused on private-pay residents because they have greater latitude in establishing the price of the services they provide to these residents. Consequently, competition for private-pay residents has increased. As nursing homes may be more able to innovate with a high census of these residents, it is not surprising that early adopter nursing homes also have greater numbers of private-pay residents (supporting Hypothesis 4). Being that Medicaid residents are the reference category used in the analysis, the opposite, of course, is the case for these residents. Early adopter nursing homes have lower numbers of Medicaid residents. Although not examined in this analysis, it may also be interesting to determine whether early adopter nursing homes attract private-pay residents.The results also suggest that future policies that attempt to reduce Medicaid costs in nursing homes should be more sensitive to the externalities of these decisions—in this case, less innovation. Because the effect of lower Medicaid reimbursement is mitigated by state Medicaid reimbursement policies (Hypothesis 5), it would appear that states wanting to reduce costs while not limiting facilities' abilities to be early adopters of innovations should use retrospective reimbursement.Competition in the nursing home industry is often proposed as a driving force for change in the industry (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). This is congruent with the usual econometric propositions regarding the effects of competition, although previous studies in nursing homes have not always shown this to be so (Castle and Fogel 1998   ). My result for the Herfindahl index shows that, the more facilities compete with other nursing homes, the more likely they are to be early adopters of innovations (supporting Hypothesis 7).I proposed that, in more munificent markets, nursing homes would have greater access to resources allowing them to innovate. The resources I investigated were the size of the elderly population, average income, and the number of hospital beds in the market. I find support for the latter two resources (Hypotheses 11 and 12).The results of the control variables for staffing are also worth noting. The provision of the innovations described in this analysis are often seen as intricate, involving training and requiring more care and attentiveness from staff. RNs and LPNs may be most able to respond to these challenges, thus explaining the results suggesting facilities that maintain higher levels of RNs and LPNs are likely to be early adopters of innovations. However, these caregivers also come at a higher cost than other staffing alternatives, such as nurse aides. Therefore, in recent years many nursing homes have substituted nurse aides for LPNs and RNs. The hidden cost of this substitution may be a lower ability to innovate.Contrary to my expectations, early adopter nursing homes have lower overall average occupancy rates. It would seem likely that higher average census would allow a facility to achieve economies of scale, thereby freeing resources allowing it to innovate. Nyman 1987   , however, suggests that facilities operating with high occupancy rates have less incentive to provide quality care; comparably, it may be that these facilities also have less incentive to innovate. Also, facilities with lower overall average occupancy rates may view themselves as less constrained with regard to time pressures in routine daily care tasks. Clearly, this is also dependent upon staffing levels, but lower overall average occupancy rates may enable facilities to innovate.In preliminary analyses (not shown), I included other independent control variables, in addition to ADLs, to adjust for residents' acuity in each facility. These variables included: bladder incontinence, bowel incontinence, pressure ulcers, restraint use, psychotropic drug use, and the percentage of residents with mental health problems. My rationale for including these variables was the belief that resident sickness in general, and increasing acuity levels as a result of the PPS, may promote innovation. Although these variables were not significant, their direction, and that of the ADL variable used in the analyses, suggest that if anything, wellness may be an engine of change. It may be that in facilities with high resident acuity, staff may have less time available to implement innovations. This may be an area for subsequent investigation.In one of the few studies addressing innovation in nursing homes, Banaszak-Holl and coworkers 1996    used similar data to examine market and organizational characteristics. They also used similar dependent variables, the provision of Alzheimer's and subacute special care units. This study is different in that it was longitudinal and used more recent data. The principal difference between this study and this previous study lies in the operationalization of the dependent variable; I examined early adoption of innovations, whereas Banaszak-Holl and colleagues 1996    examined any adoption of innovations. As a result of these differences, some caution is required in comparing the studies. It is worth noting, however, that some of the findings are similar. Increased facility size and higher numbers of private-pay residents are common significant organizational factors associated with innovation. Competition and Medicaid reimbursement rates are common significant market factors associated with innovation. The competition variables are especially robust, in that a total of six different competition variables are examined in the two analyses, three of which are significant. In both studies the greatest innovation response was to competition from other nursing facilities in the market.In comparing the findings of Banaszak-Holl and colleagues 1996    with this study, some results are also dissimilar. These differences include significant findings for CON, case-mix adjustment, and for-profit status (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). Some trepidation is required in comparing significant findings from one study with nonsignificant findings in another; however, for-profit status may be noteworthy. Banaszak-Holl and coworkers identified not-for-profit facilities to be strongly associated with innovation, whereas I find no significant results for facility ownership. It may be that ownership has little effect on the early adoption of innovations, but not-for-profit facilities are more likely to persist with the innovation.The reasons for performance gaps in innovation between nursing homes remain largely unexplained, but are of interest to the industry and policy makers (Nelson and Mullins 1985   ). An important challenge facing nursing homes is the attempt to become more innovative. Organizational and market characteristics can be important in demonstrating which factors might be most compatible with innovation (Kim 1980   ). Clearly, the practical implications from some results, such as average occupancy, are limited. Few legislators or facilities are likely to advocate reducing average occupancy rates in the interests of increasing innovation. The results for competition and staffing have more utility.The nursing home industry has some barriers to free market competition, including CON legislation, new construction moratoria, and regulated reimbursement rates. Some debate has been aimed at promoting more competition in the industry. This study shows that one potential benefit of promoting more competition would be more early innovation adoption. I do not include competition from such important substitutes for nursing home care as board-and-care homes and home care providers in my analyses. Examining whether competition from these providers affects early innovation adoption may also be relevant to policy.Caregiver staffing provisions are included in many recent pieces of nursing home legislation. For example, the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA) mandated that nurse aides must complete 75 hours of training and pass a competency examination. I do not assess training, but this study supports this legislative emphasis on caregivers.An understanding of the differences of innovation in the hospital and nursing home industries may be useful, especially for policy makers concerned with both. Although this study does not answer this question, some commonalities are evident when combining the results of this study with other nursing home studies and comparing these with hospital-based studies. Facility size and competition are especially robust.The implications of this study, of course, must be tempered against researchers' relatively undeveloped understanding of innovation in general. The innovation literature is very clear in stating that the knowledge base is inconclusive and inconsistent (Abrahamson 1991   ). Research is needed in several areas, including types of innovations, stages of the innovation process, outcomes of innovation, and the attributes of the innovations examined. In a review of the literature, Wolfe 1994    expands upon each of these areas. Limitations of the Study Although the longitudinal study design has desirable statistical properties for this analysis, several limitations are worth noting. First, some nursing homes do not seek either Medicare or Medicaid certification and are not included in the OSCAR (these facilities represent only 7% of all nursing home beds nationally). Second, OSCAR data are collected for each nursing home at one point in time. The collection of data in this way is limited in that the prevalence of factors such as the use of staff may either be under- or overestimated. Other factors, such as ownership, may alter between inspections. To the extent that this occurs, some of the organizational factors may be misrepresented. Similarly, the market variable measuring presence of a CON or new construction moratoria does not capture the historical influence of policies to limit bed supply.Managed care may influence early innovation adoption. Binstock and Spector 1997    identify managed care as a potential important influence on long-term care facilities. Banaszak-Holl and colleagues 1996    find HMO penetration significant for some innovations. In preliminary analyses I attempted to include a variable representing managed care penetration. Data for this variable proved to be either unreliable or unavailable for all time periods. Clearly, more research is needed to understand the influence of managed care on early innovation adoption.The proportion of Medicare recipients in a facility may also influence early innovation adoption (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). For example, Medicare recipients are more likely to require subacute care, and as such a higher proportion of these residents may foster innovation in the provision of this care (Banaszak-Holl et al. 1996   ). In preliminary analyses I examined the proportion of Medicare recipients. My results were not significant. This may be because I examined 13 innovations, some of which may not be influenced by the proportion of Medicare recipients; alternatively, the proportion of Medicare residents may not influence early innovation adoption but may influence innovation in general. The differences between early innovation adoption by a facility and innovation in general may be an area for subsequent investigation.Shortell and colleagues 1995    have shown that a narrow focus on a small number of outcome measures can be misleading and may lead to erroneous, or incomplete, conclusions. For similar reasons, Kimberly and Evanisko 1981    have advocated examining several innovations. By including 13 types of innovations, my approach provides a more generalizable picture of early innovation by nursing homes. Given the limited number of studies in this area, I feel this approach to be an appropriate starting point. In using this approach, however, my analyses may be underspecified in that they may not include specific variables such as cost or quality factors influencing the adoption of individual innovations. For example, some states have provided increased Medicaid reimbursement for special care units, a factor that I do not account for. As such, more specific innovation studies are also warranted. Examining costs may be especially productive. Organizational types may differ in their innovation adoption based on costs. For example, for-profit homes may be early adopters of cost-reducing innovations. I would have also liked to include other innovations examined by previous researchers, such as use of TQM and computerization of medical records. However, these variables are not included in the OSCAR data.Some conceptual limitations of this study are also worth noting. For example, this study was undertaken with the belief that identifying characteristics associated with early adoption of innovations could be useful in further facilitating the diffusion of innovations in the nursing home setting. This may be the case, but it is also representative of the positive bias that pervades innovation research (Kimberly 1981   ). Certainly, not all innovations are beneficial, and organizations may fail as the result of innovation adoption. Moreover, it is possible for organizations to superficially adopt innovations—for the purposes of prestige, for example (Downs and Mohr 1975   ). In addition, early adopters do not always have the highest degrees of commitment to the innovation (Downs and Mohr 1975   ).I also assume that the facilities I examined are early innovators. This is based on the assumption that special care units and subacute care services will continue to diffuse throughout the industry. If these innovations do not continue to diffuse, then my analyses include both early and late adopters. If this were the case, my analyses would not be representative of early adopters, but represent a comparison of any innovation adoption compared to nonadoption. However, given the trend of the 1992 to 1997 data and examining the more recently available 1999 data, these innovations are continuing to diffuse throughout nursing homes. A related point is that my analyses examine early adopters as compared to nonadopters of innovations. When the data become available, and innovation diffusion has been sufficient, more refined analyses could compare early, late, and nonadopter facilities. Conclusion This analysis examines the impact of market and organizational characteristics on the early adoption of innovations. Admittedly, market and organizational characteristics are but two of several factors that could influence the provision of innovations. Other important factors could include influential physicians and nursing home administrators. These are no less important and should also be examined. However, a nursing home will innovate, or will not, insofar as routines and practices embodied in the facility promote innovation. These routines and practices may reflect an amalgam of individual skills and need not correspond to any one individual's learning or skills. Moreover, routines and practices may persist because of past experience and "lessons" within the organization, regardless of its current employees (Levitt and March 1988   ). As Zmud 1984   (p. 727) has described, organizations can have a "receptivity toward change." This analysis is important in that it shows that organizational and market characteristics of nursing homes affect their receptivity toward early adoption of innovations.These findings add to the body of literature on innovation in nursing homes. However, as with most research, several intriguing questions follow from this study. First, consideration may be given to the question of whether organizational and market characteristics affect the rate of innovation adoption. Second, examining how innovation is diffused among early adopters and if this is different from later adopters may offer further insight into the mechanics of early adoption. The extent of innovation adoption may be influenced by organizational and market characteristics and may also be different among early adopters and later adopters. Finally, some refinement in innovation attributes may add to the consistency of research results (Damanpour 1991   ). For example, administrative versus technical, radical versus incremental, high-risk versus low-risk, and product versus process are refinements commonly used, and each may be associated with distinct organizational and market characteristics.

     Abstract Purpose: The aim of this study was to validate a pain scale for the Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment instrument and examine prevalence of pain in major nursing home subpopulations, including type of admission and cognitive status. Design and Methods: This study considered validation of the MDS pain items and derivation of scale performed against the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), using Automatic Interaction Detection. The derivation data describe 95 postacute care nursing home patients who are able to communicate. The scale is then used in retrospective analysis of 34,675 Michigan nursing home residents. Results: A four-group scale was highly predictive of VAS pain scores (variance explanation 56%) and therefore quite valid in detecting pain. In the prevalence sample, only 47% of postacute patients compared to 63% of postadmission patients reported no pain, and these percentages rose with increasing cognitive impairment. Implications: Pain is prevalent in nursing home residents, especially in those with cognitive dysfunction, and often untreated.   Care planning ,  Comprehensive assessment ,  Long-term care Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 mandated that a comprehensive and uniform resident assessment system be implemented nationwide in all United States nursing homes. The Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) system, with its Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment, was implemented in 1991 (Morris et al. 1990   ). The purpose of the RAI was mandated in the original law: to improve care. It was assumed that improved, individualized assessment of a resident's condition would lead to better care planning that would, in turn, lead to better care and improved outcomes. This logic of achieving improved care requires at least that the assessment is accurate and valid.In this context, pain is a domain acknowledged to be critical yet underrecognized in older people. Prevalence estimates of pain among nursing home residents range from 26% to 66% (Sengstaken and King 1993   ; Won et al. 1999   ). Physicians frequently fail to identify symptoms of pain among nursing home residents and when symptoms are observed, they are often inconsistently documented (Ferrell, Ferrell, and Rivera 1995   ; Won et al. 1999   ). Furthermore, pain among nursing home residents is often untreated (Bernabei et al. 1998   ), and is a critical issue in terminally ill individuals where it is "one of the most feared complications of growing older and the worst source of suffering for most patients" (Hazzard, Blass, Ettinger, Halter, and Ouslander 1999   , p. 433).Research on the detection and assessment of pain among cognitively impaired elders is limited. Existing studies with cognitively impaired elders have found an association with less frequent self-reports of pain (Parmelee 1996   ; Scherder, Bouma, Borkent, and Rahman 1999   ). Some have explained the inverse relationship between cognitive function and reported pain by suggesting that elders with dementia respond differently to pain than nondemented individuals (Porter et al. 1996   ). Hadjistavropoulos and colleagues have shown that verbal and nonverbal measures of pain can improve the assessment of pain among cognitively impaired individuals (Hadjistavropoulos, LaChapelle, MacLeod, Snider, and Craig 2000   ).Greater pain intensity and more localized complaints of pain have also been reported among elderly nursing home residents with major depressive symptoms, compared with those with minor or no depressive symptoms (Casten, Parmelee, Kleban, Lawton, and Katz 1995   ; Parmelee, Katz, and Lawton 1991   ). Others have found that after controlling for age, gender, race, and cognitive and health status, pain in nursing home residents is associated with activity of daily living (ADL) impairment and with decreased involvement in activities (Won et al. 1999   ).The current study considered the validity of MDS items describing pain in contrast to a standard measure of pain and derived a simple but effective pain scale. It then proceeded to use this scale to describe the prevalence of pain in a representative state's nursing home population, and in particular to examine differences in pain levels by type of admission and cognitive status. Background The National Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set Under congressional mandate, the RAI is performed on every resident in all nursing facilities that meet conditions of participation for federal funding under Medicare or Medicaid—virtually all nursing homes in the United States. The primary purpose of the embedded assessment instrument, the MDS, is to enable improved care planning. Residents are assessed on admission, on significant change, and at least annually; there is, as well, a quarterly review using a reduced subset of items. Assessments are coordinated (although not necessarily performed) by registered nurses and assessors, and are to use all sources of information (e.g., the resident, facility staff, the resident's physician, the medical chart) in determining the most appropriate response for each item. MDS items assess a broad range of domains, including physical and cognitive function, continence, mood, medical diagnoses and conditions (including pain), activity patterns, medications, and so forth. Since June 1998, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has mandated submission of the MDS in electronic form.Over the nine years since its implementation, a variety of studies have evaluated the MDS for reliability and for the validity of specific items or domains. The reliability studies have examined interobserver reliability, which is the agreement (interclass correlation) between two assessors, independently evaluating the same resident (Hawes et al. 1995   ; Morris et al. 1990   , Morris et al. 1997   ; Sgadari et al. 1997   ). These studies found adequate to good reliability for all but a few items (such as delirium) that are difficult to assess. Other studies have examined the validity of selected domains of the MDS. Several of us (Morris et al. 1997   ) demonstrated that five MDS items could be encoded in a Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) that was highly predictive of "gold standard" measures of cognition: the Folstein and colleagues' (Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ) Mini-Mental State Examination score and the Albert Test of Severe Impairment (Albert and Cohen 1992   ). Others have validated scales in the domains of psychosocial function (Mor et al. 1995   ), activities of daily living (Morris, Fries, and Morris 1999   ), nutrition (Blaum, O'Neill, Clements, Fries, and Fiatarone 1997   ), and depression (Burrows, Morris, Simon, Hirdes, and Phillips 2000   ). In addition, a national evaluation of the full RAI system has shown the system's effectiveness in improving care (Fries et al. 1997   ; Hawes et al. 1997   ; Mor et al. 1997   ; Phillips et al. 1997   ).There are two major purposes for developing scales. The first is to establish further validity, by demonstrating that some combination of MDS items accurately predicts standard, externally validated, and independently assessed measures of a domain. In this manner, we add assurance to our clinical views that these MDS items address the concept at hand. Second, a scale permits efficient amalgamation of multiple MDS items, each describing a different aspect of the domain. Thus, a scale such as the CPS summarizes succinctly the cognitive status of a resident. This scale can have direct clinical utility, can permit summarization of a group of assessments (e.g., of a facility or population) for multiple purposes such as quality measurement or policy formulation, and can serve in statistical models to adjust for preexisting conditions in populations for which we would want to analyze outcomes.The MDS measures of pain fit into this context. The original MDS promulgated in 1991 had only two pain items, each coded yes/no: "Resident complains or shows evidence of pain daily or almost daily," and the very specific "Mouth pain." While no direct validation study has been performed to date, the national RAI evaluation referenced earlier found that residents' pain was more prevalently reported after implementation of the RAI, perhaps due to increased attention to this item or changes in the patient population not handled by statistical adjustments. This implied that there might be insufficient pain assessment (items) in the MDS and that the RAI system lacked a care planning module that specifically addressed pain. In view of the increasing importance of pain control in these populations, Version 2.0 of the RAI/MDS, issued in 1995, included more numerous and specific pain items (Health Care Financing Administration 1995   ). The current items from this new version are displayed in  Table 1  . Two items address the general characteristics of pain: "Pain Frequency" and "Pain Intensity," with three levels each. The remaining pain items are checklisted to indicate the site of pain. A "skip pattern" instructs the coder to skip items after the first (frequency) if there is no pain.With these several items now available in the RAI/MDS Version 2.0, we were interested in the creation of a summary pain scale and to examine whether it was a valid predictor of a "gold standard" measure of pain—the best-studied and validated measure currently available. Choosing a Pain Scale for Validation. Assessment of pain is complex because it is based on an individual's perception of pain. Thus, measurement of pain poses a challenge to clinicians, especially in older people—whether or not they have cognitive problems. Pain should be assessed from the patient's perspective, with the knowledge that their current level of pain may be affected by both clinical and personal factors (Flaherty 1996   ). In selecting an instrument for this study, we recognized the subjective nature of pain and the potential limitations of the older population targeted.The process of instrument selection began with a review of the literature. A number of well-validated instruments exist, including the Pain Thermometer, the Numeric Rating Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Verbal Descriptor Scale. Our selection criteria for a pain assessment included consideration of cost, ease of use, and evidence that the instrument has been tested and validated. As participants in this study were all over the age of 65, we wanted to be sure that it would be specifically applicable. We were also committed to using a self-report instrument. The VAS was chosen as the external standard for its demonstrated sensitivity to pick up a continuum of pain severities and efficiency of administration (Herr and Mobily 1993   ). The vertical version of the VAS (v-VAS) is preferred by older adults (Herr and Mobily 1991   , Herr and Mobily 1993   ) and was chosen for use in this project. It is acknowledged that this measure cannot be expected to work on individuals with severe cognitive impairment or who are unable to understand or communicate. Methods Our approach was to develop a scale, based on MDS (Version 2.0) items, that would both make reasonable clinical sense and be predictive of a VAS score, independently assessed. The data collection and analytic approach are discussed in this section. Data Collection Data were collected from 25 Medicare-certified skilled nursing facilities in Massachusetts as part of a project to develop a postacute assessment system. Eligibility criteria were established to ensure that participants were receiving subacute services at the time assessments were completed. All participants (N = 95) had been admitted from an acute-care hospital, had already stayed in the nursing home more than 24 hours, were currently receiving daily skilled nursing or rehabilitation services, and were expected to return to a community-based setting (with or without home care services). Excluded from the study were patients either dying or with an expected discharge from the facility within 24 hours, and the relatively rare instances where the subject was unable to communicate.Field study nurses visited the nursing facilities at least weekly, to meet with the nursing home staff and review which patients met the selection criteria. A nurse would approach any newly admitted patients meeting the criteria and ask them to participate in the study. After informed consent was obtained, the patient was enrolled in the study and a full MDS assessment was performed, in addition to the VAS.In the version of the VAS used here, the resident was presented with a vertical line segment with bipolar anchoring labels: "no pain" (0) at one end and "worst pain possible" (10) at the other. Tick marks and values were placed uniformly along the line, representing the intermediate values 1, 2, … 9. The research nurse asked the participants to place a mark somewhere on the continuum showing the intensity of their pain. The response was then coded as a number between 0 and 10, using 0.5 for responses recorded between the tick marks.Standard training and assessment protocols for the MDS and VAS were employed. For the MDS, this included reliance on all sources of information for determining MDS assessment items. When information was conflicting or missing, the best judgment of the assessor determined the appropriate response. For the VAS, the research nurse explained the scale and the definition of pain (e.g., that pain is discomfort that may occur anywhere in the body, that it may have characteristics such as aching, hurt, pulling, tightness, burning, or pricking, and that it may be mild to severe). To verify that the participants understood how the word "pain" (or/and other word preferred by the subject) was being used, the participants were asked to describe the worst pain they had ever experienced and then asked to rate that pain on the VAS scale. The nurse went on to ask the patient about the pain that he or she was currently experiencing and either let the patient score directly on the VAS instrument or scored it herself, based on the patient's instructions.The analyses to derive the pain scale used all observations with valid VAS scores (three observations were dropped due to uncodable responses). All MDS assessments retained had the appropriate skip pattern for pain items (see  Table 1  ). In the analysis, we also utilized the MDS measures of ADL (6-level measures of functional performance in bed mobility, bed–chair transfer, locomotion off the unit and on the unit, walking in room and in unit, eating, toileting, dressing, and personal hygiene) and the five items that form the CPS scale (decision making, ability to make self understood, short-term memory, and eating performance; comatose was not an issue here as all patients in the sample were able to communicate).After the pain algorithm (described in Results) was developed, we used it to profile the prevalence of pain in all residents of Michigan nursing homes from October 1998 through October 1999. All data were collected using the new MDS Version 2.0. As there were multiple assessments for each resident, we used only the first; in total, we had assessments of 34,675 unique individuals. These assessments were then classified into three types: (a) postacute admission, as identified by the coded "reason for assessment"; (b) other admission; and (c) postadmission (i.e., all other assessments). Analytic Approach Our initial analyses selected those MDS variables that would be useful in predicting high VAS scores. Given the small sample size, we restricted consideration to a limited number of independent variables that might help predict the VAS score. Based on clinical input, the items selected represented direct measures of pain (including site of pain) and the presence of diseases likely to have substantial pain (cancer, arteriosclerotic heart disease, congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, pathological bone fracture, and arthritis). To these we added all MDS measures of physical function and the CPS scale, to identify dementia that could change perception of pain.From these variables we developed an index predicting the VAS score, using the tree-generation approach of Automatic Interaction Detection (AID), as implemented by the PC-Group program (Austin Data Management 1992   ). Tree-based splitting has a tactical advantage in the presence of strong statistical interactions (when one characteristic is important in explaining the dependent variable of interest only in the presence of other characteristics). An example would be that pain intensity was only predictive of VAS-measured pain when the pain was frequent. The PC-Group package has been used successfully for scale development in nursing home populations in creating both the RUG-III case-mix measurement systems (Fries et al. 1994   ) and the CPS (Morris et al. 1994   ) previously discussed. In using PC-Group, the VAS was the dependent variable and was treated as continuous even though the coding was limited to multiples of 0.5. PC-Group attempts to find subgroups of all observations in the sample, defined by the independent variables by a series of "splits." The rationale for considering splits is based on a combination of statistical and clinical criteria. From the statistical view, individual variables and the resulting index need to explain differences in the VAS pain measure. A primary measure of statistical adequacy is variance explanation (VE), a statistic that represents the percentage of all variation in the dependent variable (i.e., the VAS) that is explained by the independent variable(s) considered; VE ranges from 0 to 100%. Also, the derived system should make clinical sense (e.g., higher levels of VAS would be associated with the presence of a medical condition potentially associated with pain, such as cancer).The distribution of Michigan residents across the pain scale was then examined, both by type of assessment (postacute, other admission, and postadmission) and by levels of the CPS. To test whether there were differences in the distribution of the pain scale values across the different populations, we used a chi-squared test.Finally, we examined the reporting of pain by levels of cognitive functioning. Within each of the three resident types indicated earlier, and for each level of the CPS, we computed the percentage of Michigan nursing home residents reported on the MDS as having no pain. To test whether there were differences across the levels of the CPS and population, we formed a logistic regression model of the presence of pain, with independent variables representing six CPS levels (intact as the reference group) and two types of residents (postadmission as the reference group).Given the very large sample sizes for the reported analyses of the Michigan data, all results were significant at the p < .0001 level. We thus do not report statistical significance in the following section, and urge the reader to consider instead the substantiality of differences. Results Complete MDS and VAS data were collected from a total of 95 individuals. Overall, 71% of the sample were women, and the average age was 81 years. Of the chosen medical conditions, arthritis was the most prevalent (27%), followed closely by congestive heart failure (25%). On the MDS pain assessment items, 30 (32%) patients indicated no pain, 15 (16%) had mild pain, 26 (27%) moderate pain, and 24 (25%) horrible pain. The most frequent site of pain was the back (see  Table 2  ).Using the VAS on this population, 39 (41%) indicated no pain (the difference from the 32% scored with no pain on the MDS is not significant, p < .17). There was good agreement between the MDS and the VAS on the presence of pain: of those who were assessed with no pain on the MDS, 93% had a VAS score of 0 (kappa = .707; not shown). The mean VAS score for the entire sample was 2.5.The PC-Group analysis showed that the direct measures of pain—frequency (variance explanation [VE] = 53%) and intensity (VE = 42%)—were greatly superior in predicting VAS-scored pain to all other measures considered (the next largest, walking in room, had VE = 11%). Based on this finding, the initial split separated the sample into three subsample groups, based on the three levels of pain frequency (later experiments starting with pain intensity were not as successful in leading to systems with good overall VE). For the first two groups—those with no pain, and those with pain less than daily—no additional variables were found to be effective in providing additional VAS variance explanation. In the highest group—daily pain—two ADLs (locomotion off the unit and toileting), back pain, and the MDS pain intensity item all had predictive capability. Interestingly, average VAS pain scores decreased with increasing ADL dysfunction.The best MDS Pain Scale for predicting the VAS score is shown in  Table 3  . Patients with no pain or pain less than daily form the first two index groups. Then, those patients with daily pain are split into two groups based on pain intensity: Those with horrible/excruciating pain form the highest group, and all others form an intermediate group. This system, with four groups and using two MDS variables, achieved a variance explanation of 56%. The average VAS for the lowest group was 0.1, increasing to 5.0 for the highest group. Thus, this system was slightly better than one using only pain frequency, with a variance explanation of 53% and a range from 0.1 to 4.4. The next best alternative system (not shown) had five groups and was constructed using an index constructed of the two ADLs indicated earlier and pain intensity. It achieved only slightly higher VE (59%) but had no increased range and considerably more complexity.Using the selected MDS Pain Scale in the validation sample of postacute patients, 32% were without pain, and 22% had excruciating pain. A different distribution was seen when the scale was applied to a more representative sample of all nursing home residents in Michigan. In this case, focusing on postacute admissions, 47% were without pain and only 4% in excruciating pain. In contrast, less pain was seen in other admissions (54% without pain) and even less in others seen after admission, including long-staying residents (63% without pain). To simplify comparisons, we also imputed an average VAS score for each type of patient, computed by multiplying the prevalence of each Pain Scale value by the groups' mean VAS (from the validation sample) and summing. Postacute admissions had the highest average VAS score (1.5), followed by other admissions (1.3); postadmissions had a yet lower score (1.0).The final analysis addressed the reporting of pain by those with cognitive impairment. The analysis was not performed in the validation sample, as this excluded residents cognitively impaired and unable to perform the VAS. In each of the three Michigan populations, the percentage of residents reporting no pain increased dramatically with increasing cognitive impairment. For example, in postacute admissions 31% of cognitively intact residents reported no pain compared to 69% of the most severely impaired; and 40% of cognitively intact residents compared to 79% of severely impaired in the longer-staying postadmission cohort ( Table 4  ). Discussion Reports of pain, a common characteristic of postacute patients, are increasingly recognized as an important issue in the care of nursing home residents, particularly among those with terminal conditions. As pain symptoms are usually amenable to treatment, identification of pain is an imperative to the quality of care of these individuals. The MDS Pain Scale represents a simple method to summarize the reported presence and intensity of pain using routinely collected nursing home MDS data. The scale is rather simple and based on only two MDS items. However, we found high concordance rates and variance explanation between the MDS Pain Scale and the VAS among nursing home patients in postacute settings. While the VAS is recognized as a "gold standard" measurement of pain, the Pain Scale is easier to administer and the MDS is already available for all nursing home residents. With this validation, the Pain Scale can be used for epidemiological studies in the large MDS databases that are now accumulating. Both pain intensity and frequency were useful factors, a result that validates the revisions made (from a simply dichotomous indicator of the presence of pain) moving to Version 2.0 of the MDS. Perhaps equally important to the scale's simplicity is that no other MDS items were of use in predicting measured pain.Given that pain can often be alleviated, the results of analyzing the Michigan nursing home population are disquieting. Symptoms of daily pain are seen in 16% of current residents and as many as 28% of postacute patients, prevalences somewhat consistent with other research in chronic settings, such as Won and colleagues 1999   , who found 26% of patients in daily pain in a sample of more than 49,000 nursing home patients.Still more disturbing is that cognitive impairment appears to diminish the reporting of pain. Those with higher cognitive impairment will, on average, be sicker. Yet, pain is substantially less reported for those with even moderate impairment. This finding is in concert with our other finding that reported levels of pain decreased with increasing ADL dysfunction. Clinicians need to be especially vigilant in looking for indicators of pain in impaired individuals.This study has a number of limitations that may impede the generalizability of our findings. The validation sample was relatively small, and the distributions of reported pain is relevant only for the sample that was able to give consent. It is important to note that our sample was predominantly cognitively alert, with 60% scoring as cognitively intact on the CPS. Clearly, the VAS cannot be performed on those unable to communicate or severely cognitively impaired, and we cannot assume that the Pain Scale will work for those individuals. It remains a question (and an area for improvement) whether assessors using the MDS are able to identify signs of pain in those who are unable to report it. Finally, we may not be able to generalize our findings to particular subpopulations seen in nursing homes, such as those of particular cultures, genders, ages, or particular conditions (such as terminal illness); we did not have a sufficiently large sample to test the Pain Scale on these subsamples.We already have begun studies that will improve both the content and the generalizability of the results reported here. In moving from Version 1 to Version 2.0 of the MDS pain items, reliability increased, prevalence estimates doubled, and barriers to accurate assessment by facility staff were greatly reduced. As part of the interRAI–HCFA effort to create the third generation of the MDS for nursing homes, we are examining the issue of pain measurement for both verbal and nonverbal patients near the end of life. Under consideration are supplemental assessment items that address whether the pain is new (i.e., first arose in the prior 3 days), whether the pain has worsened in the prior 3 days, and whether the pain is present with movement and at rest. In addition, InterRAI–HCFA is looking at the issue of nonverbal markers that could and should be relied upon in assessing pain. When sufficient data are available, we will be able to assess how this will affect the Pain Scale described here and our understanding of pain prevalence.The strengths of this study include the relative psychometric properties of the MDS and the VAS, both measures having been tested elsewhere (Hawes et al. 1995   ; Herr and Mobily 1991   ; Sgadari et al. 1997   ). The MDS pain frequency and pain intensity, in particular, achieve interrater reliabilities of 0.73 and higher. Further, the ability to use a full state's nursing home population in research strengthens our expectation that the results will be valid for the U.S. institutionalized population.Given the correlates of pain among nursing home residents and the existing treatment options for pain, we believe the use of the MDS Pain Scale will enable clinicians better to identify and treat pain, with a concomitant reduction of comorbid mood symptoms and ADL impairment.

     Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this report is to provide basic descriptive information on community-dwelling, disabled, private long-term care (LTC) insurance policyholders who have accessed policy benefits. We focus on how benefits are used, whether claimants feel they are getting appropriate value from their policies, and what the patterns are of formal and informal service use. Design and Methods: Data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 693 LTC insurance claimants who were receiving benefits while living in the community and 424 of their informal caregivers. Eight of the largest LTC insurance companies representing about 80% of the market participated in the study. Results: LTC insurance benefits are well targeted; they serve those truly dependent on ongoing care. The vast majority of claimants are satisfied with their policies, understand their coverage, and find it easy to file claims. Because of their LTC benefits, substantial numbers of disabled elderly individuals report that they are able to remain at home instead of being forced to seek institutional care. The availability of LTC benefits reduces stress among informal caregivers. For most claimants, formal care did not replace informal caregiving. Implications: As the LTC insurance market continues to grow and mature, there will be changes in the profile of claimants, the service delivery system, and the design of policies. Expansions in the private market will be associated with a greater number of disabled elderly remaining in their homes with a maintenance of and enhanced resiliency of informal support networks.   Chronic care service use ,  Home care ,  Long-term care claimants Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe population of Americans who require or are at risk of requiring help with personal care and other daily functional tasks is growing rapidly. This is primarily due to the growth rate of the elderly population, especially those aged 85 and older. The percentage of elderly people requiring personal assistance ranges from 8% of those aged 65 to 69 to well over 50% of those aged 85 and over (Spector, Fleishman, Pezzin, and Spillman 1998   ). Long-term care (LTC) expenditures (i.e., expenses for nursing homes and related facilities, in-home registered nurses and home health aides, and other home- and community-based services) now account for almost 12% of total personal health expenditures—a threefold increase since 1960. Among people aged 65 and older, LTC expenditures account for 28% of personal health expenditures (AARP 1997   ).Those elders who do require formal (paid) LTC are likely to rely on out-of-pocket payments to fund such care. Although Medicare pays 55% of the acute medical expenditures of older Americans, its LTC coverage is limited, covering just 20% of their LTC expenditures (Feder 1999   ). By contrast, out-of-pocket spending represents only 14% of medical care expenditures for elders, but it accounts for 28% of their LTC costs. Medicaid finances a much greater share of LTC services than acute care expenditures for persons aged 65 and older (38% as compared to 4%; Feder 1999   ).Exposure to catastrophic risks of this nature typically stimulates expanded public financing, a demand for private insurance, or both. Over the past decade, the potential for private LTC insurance to become a significant source of financing for formal LTC services has been much debated (Cohen, Tell, Greenberg, and Wallack 1987   ; Crown, Leutz, and Capitman 1992   ; Friedland 1990   ; Meiners 1984   ; Mulvey and Stucki 1998   ; Rivlin, Wiener, Hanley, and Spence 1988   ; Wiener, Hanley, and Illston 1992   ; Wiener, Tilly, and Goldenson 2000   ). Even as the debate continues, recent actions suggest that the federal government may look to private insurance to help address the LTC financing challenge. Private LTC insurance typically reimburses the costs of care provided in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as in-home personal care services such as home health aides, personal care services, therapies, and nursing services.The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 included tax incentives for the purchase of LTC insurance. More recently, the President recommended that a new LTC insurance program be established for federal employees and that a tax credit of up to $1,000 per year be available to those caring for disabled relatives.Prior to 1985, the private LTC insurance market barely existed. By the end of 1999 it is estimated that more than 6 million LTC policies will have been sold, and in-force premiums will exceed $4 billion (Health Insurance Association of America [HIAA], 1998; National Institute for Health Care Management 1999   ). It is likely that the LTC insurance market will continue to expand. This is because of the increase in the number of employers as well as insurers entering the market and the increasing interest among younger elders (HIAA 2000   ).There is a body of knowledge about who buys policies and what motivates them to do so (American Council of Life Insurers 2000   ; HIAA 2000   ), but there has been no systematic study of individuals who are receiving benefits under private LTC insurance policies. An understanding of claimants and their behavior should help consumers make more informed choices about financing their potential LTC needs, help the private insurance industry better meet those needs, and inform public policies designed to support and regulate the market.The purpose of this study is to provide basic descriptive information on community-dwelling, disabled, private LTC insurance policyholders who have accessed policy benefits. We provide information on the sociodemographic and service utilization profile of these claimants and characterize the level and mix of informal and formal support. We address the implications of the receipt of LTC insurance benefits for use of formal and informal caregiving, the amount of care received, the impact of insurance benefits on the disabled as well as on those caring for disabled elders, and the impact on choices about where care is received. Finally, we summarize claimants' reported level of satisfaction with their LTC insurance policy and the company providing it. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings. Methods Data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 693 LTC insurance claimants who were receiving benefits while living in the community (a response rate of 82%). Eight of the largest LTC insurance companies who represent about 80% of the private LTC policies sold today and the vast majority of claims activity provided the sample of claimants. Companies that participated in the study included Aegon Companies, Bankers Life and Casualty, Conseco Senior Health, CNA, Fortis Long-Term Care, G.E. Capital Assurance Company, John Hancock Financial Services, and UnumProvident. These companies also represent diverse market segments and policy designs, and employ differing underwriting and claims management strategies. Companies were instructed to take a random sample of "open claims" for individuals aged 65 and over who had policies that covered both nursing home and home health care services. The definition of an open claim was one for which at least one claims payment had been made and there had been no notification of the claim ceasing. All claims were ongoing or "active."Claimants from seven companies had reimbursement policies that paid expenses up to a daily maximum amount, whereas claimants from one company had policies that paid cash benefits that could be used in any way deemed appropriate by the claimant. For the most part, eligibility for benefits was based on limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), the presence of cognitive impairment, and, in some cases, medical necessity as determined by a physician.A trained nurse or social worker interviewed each claimant in his or her home. Each interviewer underwent comprehensive training to assure interrater reliability. The vast majority of questions were closed, but the claimant did have the opportunity to respond to a number of open questions. Information garnered from these interviews was then linked to policy design and claim information generated from the administrative systems of the participating insurance companies. If the claimant was cognitively impaired, then a proxy, identified by insurance company records or by the researchers upon initial contact, was interviewed. Designated contacts were asked who had the most knowledge about the claimant's health and activities. Typically these proxies were the primary informal caregivers of the insured claimants.During the interview, claimants or proxies were asked to identify their primary informal caregiver, that is, the person who regularly helped them the most with their everyday activities but did not receive monetary payment. The percentage of claimants with at least one informal caregiver was 77%. A separate telephone interview conducted with 424 of those informal caregivers had a 91% response rate. All fieldwork was completed by February 1999.The interviewer collected information on (a) the functional, cognitive, and medical status of the claimant; (b) the level and types of assistance received from paid and family caregivers; (c) the family's interaction with the insurance company and the service system; and (d) basic sociodemographic information such as living arrangement, marital status, and income level. The administrative data provided from the insurance company had detailed policy design information as well as claims payments history. Results Profiling Privately Insured Claimants  Table 1  compares the demographic profile of privately insured claimants with a sample of privately insured nonclaimants and with a sample of elders age 65 and over.In general, privately insured claimants are more likely to be older, widowed, and more frequently White than are elders in the general population. They are also less likely to have children living nearby. Long-term care insurance claimants are wealthier than their counterparts in the general population; they are 1.4 times more likely to have incomes greater than $30,000 than are elders in the general population. They also have significantly greater housing assets. Compared to other policyholders, claimants are older, more often female, less likely to be married, and are also less likely to have children living nearby.Currently, most available LTC policies require that an individual have at least two limitations out of six common ADLs or be cognitively impaired in order to qualify for benefits. All tax-qualified policies have such a requirement. Older and nontax-qualified policies do, however, enable an individual to access benefits if LTC services are deemed by a physician to be medically necessary. Most claimants (79%) have two or more ADL limitations. The mean number of ADL limitations is 3.3. We defined a person as limited if they required any of the following levels of assistance for a particular ADL: (a) Cueing assistance, requiring a person to be prompted to do an activity, but no physical intervention; (b) stand-by assistance, requiring a person to be nearby in case help is needed; and (c) physical "hands-on" assistance.The cognitive status of claimants was determined either by a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia (3%) or by having four or more errors on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (29%). Thus, 32% of claimants are cognitively impaired. Taken together, these findings suggest that 85% of claimants have at least two ADL limitations or are cognitively impaired; the others are either qualifying for benefits through a medical necessity benefit trigger or they are receiving benefits even though they may not be meeting benefit triggers as specified in the insurance contract at the time of the interview. Formal and Informal Care Services Among Privately Insured Claimants It is well known that most long-term care is provided informally by family members, typically spouses, daughters, and daughters-in-laws (National Alliance for Caregiving 1998   ; Penrod, Kane, Kane, and Finch 1995   ; Tennstedt 1999   ).  Table 1  revealed that many privately insured claimants live alone and do not have children living nearby. For those without informal caregivers, the LTC policy should facilitate use of formal (paid) support. For those with informal supports, the policy may enable them to decrease reliance on such support—an important motivator for initial purchase (Cohen and Kumar 1997   ). Most claimants (77%) rely on a combination of formal (paid) and informal (unpaid) care, but 23% rely solely on formal (paid) services for their care. In contrast, among disabled noninsured elders, only about 4% rely exclusively on formal care (Jackson and Doty 1999   ). Thus, privately insured disabled claimants are about six times more likely to rely exclusively on formal care than are nonprivately insured disabled elders living in the community. Home health aides provide most of the formal care given to claimants; two in three claimants receive care from this type of service provider. Less than 10% of claimants rely on skilled nurses for home care services. This represents a significantly lower usage than is observed in the disabled Medicare population (Jackson and Doty 1999   ).In order to continue living independently in the community, claimants also need assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).  Fig. 1  shows that, on average, these claimants receive 59 hours of personal care a week (roughly 8 hours per day), over half of which is devoted to IADL assistance. Not shown in the figure is the fact that privately insured disabled elders receive more weekly care (formal and informal together) than do similarly disabled nonprivately insured elders (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation & Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 1999). Thus, any reductions in the level of informal caregiving brought about by the presence of insurance-financed care are more than offset by increases in formal care.Formal and informal caregivers provide different degrees of assistance. Formal caregivers split their assistance fairly evenly between ADL and IADL activities. Informal caregivers generally provide greater amounts of IADL assistance (14 hours per week) than ADL assistance (9 hours per week). It should be noted that the averages for care are pushed up by the fact that roughly 10% of the sample receives round-the-clock care—24 hours per day, 7 days a week—most of it standby assistance.Much of the cost of formal care is paid for by insurance benefits. In fact, insurance pays all of the costs of care for more than 70% of claimants. The average monthly insurance benefit paid to claimants is $1,527. (These data were obtained from the administrative claims systems from each of the insurance companies.) How does this compare to the primary public payer of home- and community-based care for disabled elders—the Medicaid waiver program? The Medicaid waiver program pays an average of about $485 per month for care (Ladd, Kane, and Kane 1999   ). Impact of Private LTC Insurance on Claimants and Informal Caregivers Claimants and informal caregivers were asked how having an LTC insurance policy has influenced the level and type of care received (by claimants) and provided (by informal caregivers). For claimants, the greatest impact of insurance benefits is on their level of paid care. To measure this, we asked claimants, "In the absence of the policy, would you be able to afford the amount of care that you currently receive?" as well as, "In the absence of your policy, would you receive fewer hours of paid care?" Only 40% indicated that they would be able to afford their current level of services, and some 57% responded that they would have to consume fewer hours of paid care. This implies that an absence of insurance would be associated with more unmet or undermet need. How would such needs be fulfilled? Claimants were asked, "In the absence of your policy, would you have to rely more on family, friends, or other volunteers to provide assistance?" Fifty-four percent indicated that they would have to rely more on informal supports. It is unclear from these data alone whether such informal supports would be able to compensate for the loss associated with lower levels of formal (paid) care.We asked a similar, although more detailed, set of questions to informal caregivers.Do they provide more, less, or the same amount of care now that insurance benefits are being paid to the claimant than when they first began caring?In the absence of the claimant's policy would they provide more, less, or the same amount of care as they currently provide?In the presence of policy benefits, has the nature of the care they provide changed and if so, how? Fig. 2  shows that roughly two in three informal caregivers have not reduced the level of care that they provide since insurance benefits started. In fact, half of the caregivers report no change in the amount of care they provide. This suggests that formal care is certainly not a perfect substitute for informal care, a finding consistent with research on the interaction between formal and informal caregiving in the context of public programs (Hanley, Wiener, and Harris 1991   ; Jackson 1997   ; Tennstedt, Crawford, and McKinlay 1993   ; Yordi et al. 1997   ). Still, about one in three informal caregivers did indicate that they now provide less informal care. As for the caregivers, a slight majority (52%) indicated that if the policy were not paying benefits they would increase the level of care that they provide. These findings are consistent with recent studies showing that formal services are generally used in conjunction with informal care, and secondary to it; substitution of formal services for informal care is limited and temporary (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation & DHHS, 1999; Tennstedt 1999   ).It is noteworthy that 15% of informal caregivers provide more informal care following the commencement of insurance benefits and the increase of formal care. This could reflect deterioration in the claimant's condition since the onset of benefit payments, meaning that the informal caregiver has had to increase the amount of care provided. It may also be that the presence of formal caregivers has simply encouraged informal caregivers to provide more but perhaps different care. Thus, in some instances, formal care may be a complementary rather than substitute service for informal caregiving. With respect to the third question, most caregivers (72%) indicate that they have not changed the nature of the care that they provide. For the remaining 28%, most show reductions in ADL and IADL assistance and an increase in companionship services.Informal caregiving can be very stressful (National Alliance for Caregiving 1998   ). Informal caregivers were asked whether the level of stress has changed since the person they care for began receiving insurance benefits. Most (68%) reported that their level of stress had decreased (see  Fig. 3 ). This is consistent with the belief that an increase in formal care relieves the family member or friend of the responsibilities of managing and providing care. Even so, other factors unrelated to the presence of insurance-financed benefits also likely affect stress levels.The entry of formal caregivers could lead to congestion and confusion in service provision. The need to monitor formal caregivers or to interact with the insurer as well as with providers might have led to increased stress for informal caregivers. Such is not the case. Only 4% of informal caregivers indicate that the presence of insurance increased stress levels. One quarter of informal caregivers indicate that the presence of insurance-financed formal services had no effect on their stress level.Given the fact that both the formal and informal care networks are providing significant amounts of care to disabled claimants, a key question emerges: Are the care needs of claimants being adequately addressed? We focus on whether or not certain needs are being undermet. An undermet need is present when a claimant receives assistance performing a particular activity but indicates that they could use more help or believes that they had to wait too long to receive the help. The presence of an undermet need could reflect the fact that caregivers are not available in a timely manner; or, it could result from scheduling difficulties or because, once in the home, caregivers are not providing care when needed. Additionally, it may be that caregivers do not provide an adequate level of care either because of quality or coordination issues.In total, 23% of claimants report at least one undermet need. Individuals who receive more hours of ADL assistance are also more likely to report greater undermet need. This is particularly true for individuals who rely more on informal rather than formal caregivers. This suggests that when multiple caregivers are involved in the care of an individual, clearly delineated lines of responsibility may be particularly important in assuring that needs are met. One implication of these findings is that training informal caregivers may better prepare them to respond to the multiple needs of their disabled care receivers. Bathing was the ADL with the highest level of reported undermet need. This is not surprising, given the complexity of the activity and the greater chance for mismatch between service schedules and claimant preferences. Those most likely to report undermet needs are unmarried women and individuals with multiple caregivers.Clearly, long-term care insurance is succeeding in bringing formal caregivers into the homes of disabled elders, many of whom rely solely on the insurance to provide access to care. Yet problems with service availability, scheduling, continuity and coordination of caregivers, claimant preference, and the quality of caregivers all contribute to a sizable minority reporting undermet needs.A great deal of research has focused on whether the use of formal home care services delays or eliminates the use of costly institutional care such as nursing home care (Garber and McCurdy 1989   ; Greene, Lovely, and Ondrich 1993   : Kane 1998   ; Shapiro and Tate 1988   ; Weissert, Cready and Pawelak 1988   ; Weissert and Hedrick 1994   ; Wolf 1997   ). Most of this research suggests that, unless very carefully targeted, home care rarely prevents someone from using nursing home care. There is a growing consensus that home care serves a distinct population that differs in relevant respects from the nursing home population. Still, the decision to seek institutional care is complicated; it involves a myriad of factors, many of which cannot be adequately captured even by the most sophisticated multivariate modeling.We elected to address this important issue directly. Claimants and informal caregivers were asked whether the disabled claimant would be able to remain in the home if there were no LTC insurance policy to finance formal care. More specifically, claimants were asked, "If your long-term care policy was not paying for home care services, do you think you would be able to remain in your home or would you have to move to an institutional setting like an assisted living facility or a nursing home?" Their primary informal caregivers were asked, "If home care services were not covered by the care receiver's LTC insurance policy, do you think he/she would need to seek institutional care such as nursing home care or assisted living?"  Fig. 4  summarizes results.Approximately half of both claimants and informal caregivers responded that in the absence of the insurance-financed services, they would have to seek institutional alternatives. An important matter is whether there is agreement about institutional alternatives between the claimant and her/his informal caregiver. In 31% of the cases where we had responses from both claimant and caregiver, they agreed that institutional alternatives would be needed in the absence of an LTC policy. In 18% of the cases the informal caregiver felt that the claimant would need institutional care and the claimant disagreed, whereas in 9% the claimant felt she/he would need institutional care and the informal caregiver disagreed. Thus, it appears that between one third and one half of disabled policyholders believe that they would not be able to remain in their homes without their insurance-financed formal care services. Although a stated intention to seek institutional care does not always translate into a particular behavior, it is reasonable to assume that given their level of disability, a number of these individuals would qualify and be appropriate candidates for certain institutional settings. While supply constraints may impede their access to such care, many believe that without their home care benefits, they would need to consider this.Among claimants who thought that they could not remain in the community without their insurance benefits, roughly half said they would need to enter a nursing home and half indicated they would move to an assisted living facility. Claimant Satisfaction Claimants were asked a series of questions related to general satisfaction with their insurance policy.  Fig. 5  shows that the vast majority of claimants (86%) are satisfied with their policy; slightly less than two in three are very satisfied with their policy.Despite reported high levels of satisfaction, about one third of claimants felt that they had not purchased enough home care benefits. Given that most policies cover 3 to 4 years of care, and the average claimant has been receiving benefits for slightly more than a year, this deficiency is related to the daily benefit amount chosen at the time of purchase. Although this does not represent an inherent flaw in insurance policy design, it does suggest that these claimants may not have had enough information on the actual costs of care that they might incur. (The issue is not related to affordability. Income level was not related to whether or not claimants felt that they had purchased enough home care coverage.) This finding may also be a response to the actual effect of voluntary coinsurance: When people are actually faced with paying it, they don't like it. The implication is that additional consumer education is needed to assure that at the time of purchase, individuals have an understanding of the relationship between benefit amounts and costs of care.Most claimants (70%) found the claims filing process to be easy, and 90% of all individuals filing claims had either no disagreements with their insurance companies or had a disagreement(s) that was resolved satisfactorily. About 10% of claimants felt their disagreement was not resolved satisfactorily. Claimants were also asked a question about actions that their insurance company might have taken, but didn't, to help them when they needed benefits. This was an open-ended question. While about three in four respondents felt there was nothing else that the insurance company should have done, many of the remaining respondents felt that the company could have provided additional customer support, improved claims processing, and given more advice about the policy itself. It is noteworthy that claimants with cash disability policies did express the highest level of satisfaction regarding their interactions with the insurance companies. Discussion Study Limitations This research provides much needed information on a topic that has had little focus to date, but a number of limitations should be noted. First, because roughly one in three claimants was cognitively impaired, we needed to conduct interviews with proxies. The vast majority of these interviews were conducted with spouses and adult children, most often identified as the primary informal caregiver of the insured claimant. These proxies' responses to certain questions related to satisfaction, undermet need, and even to the amount of care provided may differ from the views of the claimants themselves. Second, it is important to note that the functional and cognitive status of elders can and does change rapidly (Manton, Corder, and Stallard 1997   ). However, the cross-sectional nature of the study design does not enable us to adequately capture such changes over time. Thus, while we can estimate the prevalence of disability at a point in time, it is quite possible that had interviews been conducted at another point, these estimates would have differed.Finally, although the sample of claimants was drawn to be representative, it does represent the first major wave of claimants. Most sales of LTC insurance policies have occurred in the last 5 years, and these new policyholders are not likely to make claims for 5 to 10 years into the future. Patterns of service use, interactions with insurers, and the extent of undermet need and satisfaction levels may vary greatly as insurers and providers are faced with a much larger pool of claimants. Findings here are applicable to this first, relatively smaller, wave of claimants. Summary and Implications Individuals with LTC insurance receive substantial amounts of standby ADL and IADL assistance, typically more than what is received by similarly disabled nonprivately insured elders (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation & DHHS, 1999). Also, the insurance benefits are targeted on individuals with significant ADL dependencies and/or cognitive impairments, as well as on individuals who appear to be on a downward path toward greater disability. For many, in conjunction with the informal care that they receive, the ability to access formal care services through their LTC policy helps them to continue living independently in their homes. A large number of claimants (one fourth) have no available informal support services. As for claimants with informal supports, the availability of insurance benefits has not led to a "breakdown" in informal caregiving by primary caregivers. Rather, most primary informal caregivers have at least sustained the amount of care they provide to their disabled relatives. Taken together, these observations suggest that formal care may substitute for some, but not most, informal care, and that the two systems appear to be working in tandem to meet the LTC needs of claimants.Findings suggest that while adequate financing of care is a necessary condition for meeting the needs of insured and disabled elders, it is clearly not sufficient. Close cooperation and coordination with the service delivery network is critically important. This holds true for individuals being cared for in institutional settings as well. In such settings, issues related to the quality and training of staff, the amount of staff oversight, and staff ratios will determine whether claimants feel that their needs are being adequately addressed.Most claimants feel that they are receiving significant benefits from their LTC policy and that it is doing what it is supposed to do, namely, helping to bring paid caregivers into the home or accessing the institutional care that they need. What they believe they need is somewhat better servicing of their claim and more assistance managing providers so that they receive the care that they need when they need it.About half of claimants and informal caregivers reported that in the absence of insurance benefits, institutional alternatives such as assisted living or nursing home residency would likely be required. This is a particularly important finding. Already, the demand for nursing home care has been declining (Bishop 1999   ). Data suggest that an increase in the number of LTC insurance policies covering home- and community-based alternatives, as well as institutional options, will buttress this trend. The preference of disabled elders to remain in their homes for as long as possible is well known; these claimants believe that at the very least, the presence of insurance-financed benefits delays their search for institutional alternatives. However, additional analysis is needed to determine whether these individuals have the level of functional and cognitive disability that would make them appropriate placements in institutional settings.As the LTC insurance market continues to grow and mature, there will be changes in the profile of claimants, the service delivery system, and the design of policies. New patterns of service utilization will emerge, but facets of existing usage patterns will remain the same. It seems very likely that expansion in the private market will be associated with a greater number of disabled elders remaining in their homes with a maintenance of and enhanced resiliency of informal support networks.

     Abstract Purpose: Limited information is available on the effects of caregiving experiences on the adult development of caregivers under 21 years old in the United States. The current study provided an examination of the effects of youthful caregiving on the mental health of these persons when adults. Design and Methods: Twelve individuals, 23 to 58 years old, were given brief phone interviews with semistructured questions, and then they completed questionnaires on their early caregiving experiences and current mental health. To be included, respondents must have provided primary caregiving assistance (i.e., bathing, dressing, feeding, etc.) for at least one parent when the caregiver was under 21 years old. Results: The findings showed that individuals were young caregivers for parents with a number of problems, ranging from dementia to drug abuse. Individuals reported more positive mental health than negative mental health, and only two individuals had scores indicative of clinical depressive symptoms. Implications: It appears that early caregiving experiences may not result in universally negative consequences in the adulthood of young caregivers.   Adulthood ,  CES-D ,  Well-being Laurence G. Branch, PhDThere is no doubt that the caregiving role can be stressful for individuals, and the stressors of caregiving are greatly enhanced when one is caregiving for a relative with a dementing illness (Hooker, Monahan, Bowman, Frazier, and Shifren 1998   ). However, what happens when the caregiving experience starts much earlier than adulthood? Despite the abundance of research on caregiving, little research exists on early caregiving experiences and the long-term impact on the young caregivers' adult development and aging. The only research related to early caregiving that has received notice in the gerontology literature is that of extended family members' (i.e., adolescents) experiences of "informal caregiving" (Beach 1997   ; Pruchno, Peters, and Burant 1995   ).Estimates range from 19,000 to 51,000 individuals under 18 years old are primary caregivers for parents and/or grandparents in the United Kingdom (Dearden and Becker 1999   ). Large surveys conducted in the United Kingdom showed that the average age of an early caregiver was 12 years old (e.g., Dearden and Becker 1998   ). There is no precise information on the prevalence of early caregiving in the United States, as no formal national study of this problem has been conducted. Gates and Lackey 1998    found that children as young as 10 years old were providing primary care to a parent in American samples. L. Bauman has found that 35 children from 8 to 12 years old provide bed care for their mothers with late stage AIDS (personal communication, September 11, 2000). In a new survey of family caregivers in New York City, researchers have found 28 individuals between ages 18 and 21 were young caregivers (A. Kuerbis, personal communication, September 11, 2000; United Hospital Fund 2000   ).The question of importance in this study is "What are the long-term effects of early caregiving on individuals' adult mental health?" One study suggests that up to 75% of young caregivers develop psychological problems as adults (Frank, Tatum, and Tucker 1999   ), particularly if care recipients had mental illness issues or alcohol and/or drug-related problems. Additional information to answer the above question is limited. This study provides preliminary data in an ongoing investigation on this topic. Methods Participants In order to qualify for the study, individuals must have provided primary caregiving assistance (i.e., bathing, dressing, feeding, etc.) for one or both of their parents when the caregiver was under 21 years old. Eighteen individuals responded to the advertisements. Fourteen individuals qualified to participate in this study, and all 14 completed the study. Only 12 individuals are included in the analyses, because at the time of the study two individuals were under age 21, the definition of adulthood in this study. The sample included 11 women and 1 man, and the sample was primarily Caucasian (93%). The average age of participants in this study was 39.3 (SD = 13.5) years old, ranging from 23 to 58 years old. All individuals had completed high school, and about half the sample had attended college. Individuals had a socioeconomic status that reflects middle-class workers. Eight participants provided primary care for their mothers, 1 participant provided primary care for his or her father, 2 participants provided primary care for both of their parents, and 1 participant provided primary care for a grandparent. Materials Early Caregiving Experiences. I assessed the early caregiving experiences with semistructured questions, Likert responses, yes or no responses, and open-ended questions in two formats: phone interview and questionnaire. The caregiving experience phone interview and questionnaire are available upon request. Mental Health I used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff 1977   ) to assess both positive and negative mental health. I used the well-being subscale of the CES-D to measure positive mental health. Coefficient alpha was .69 for the CES-D well-being indicator (note that removal of item 4 does increase coefficient alpha to .82, but item 4 was included in the analyses to compare with prior research). I used the depression subscale of the CES-D (excluding item 14, which confounds with interpersonal relationships; Krause, Herzog, and Baker 1992   ) to measure negative mental health. Coefficient alpha was .88 for negative mental health. Procedures Individuals learned about this study from advertisements in local and national caregiving newsletters, such as the Take Care publication from the National Family Caregivers Association and the caregiving newsletter distributed by the Baltimore County Department of Aging, brochures at local physicians' offices and adult centers, or by word of mouth. I provided contact information on all advertisements. Once individuals contacted me about the study, I conducted a semistructured interview over the phone. All individuals who qualified on the basis of the phone interview agreed to participate and were sent a package of questionnaires with a self-addressed stamped envelope to return to me upon completion of the packet. The packet of questionnaires took no more than 30 min to complete and included a measure of early caregiving experience, a measure of mental health, and other measures that are part of an ongoing study on this topic. There was no monetary compensation available for participants' time and efforts. Results The average age for early caregiving occurred in early to midadolescence (M = 14.0, SD = 4.4 years old). However, the range of ages showed that the caregiving experience can begin in childhood (range = 7 to 20 years old). Second, the majority of caregivers were women (93%). Third, the duration of the caregiving experience was, on average, 4–5 years (M = 4.7, SD = 4.4 years), which would cover most of adolescent development. Most important, the majority of the sample provided complete assistance with basic activities of daily living including bathing, dressing, feeding, and helping their parents with going to the bathroom (including bed pans). This information is consistent with the studies from the United Kingdom (e.g., Dearden and Becker 1998   ) and the American samples (e.g., Gates and Lackey 1998   ).The participants reported a wide range of reasons for their parents' needing primary caregiving assistance. Different types of cancer including breast cancer and ovarian cancer were the most frequent reason for early caregiving, followed by arthritis and mental health problems. The majority of the sample had parents with chronic conditions that lasted a long period of time, and caregiving ended when the parent died. A few participants reported that their parents' conditions were acute and that recovery had occurred.An important question in this study was "What is the adult mental health of early caregivers?" The mean score for positive mental health was 5.8 (SD = 2.1); this score reflects the halfway point for the range possible on this scale (0 to 12). The mean score for negative mental health was 1.2 (SD = 1.9); this score is very low on a scale with a range of 0 to 18. Higher scores mean that more of the construct is present. Individuals were consistently more likely to report positive mental health during the past week than negative mental health, t(11) = 5.76, p ≤ .0001. When compared with prior studies that do not separate positive and negative mental health, the total CES-D score for this study had a mean value of 9.7 (SD = 6.2). This is below the cut-off value of 16 that is considered the lower end of clinical depressive symptoms (Hooker et al. 1998   ). Although the sample is small, it appears that individuals with the highest depressive scores had parents with emotional and drug abuse problems, regardless of duration of caregiving or time since completion of caregiving (see  Table 1  ). Discussion Little attention has been paid to the caregiving experience of younger caregivers, those who provide primary care for one or both parents when under 21 years old. How does the early caregiving experience effect adult development and aging? This study was a first attempt to address this question. Results should be viewed with caution as this is a preliminary investigation of ongoing research on this topic. First, results provide hope for individuals with early caregiving experiences. Overall, the sample reported more positive mental health than negative mental health, providing results similar to research on spouse caregiving (Shifren and Hooker 1995   ) and adolescent informal caregiving of grandparents (Beach 1997   ). The majority of the sample reported CES-D scores below the cut-off for clinical depressive symptoms. The only exception appeared to be early caregivers for parents with both emotional and drug abuse problems. These individuals indicated that they provided both primary physical assistance and extensive emotional support to their parents. Prior research indicates that adults with the most mental health problems tend to be from families with parents who had mental health problems including depression and drug abuse (Frank et al. 1999   ). Note that three individuals did report health problems including depression, Parkinson's disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Therefore, this small sample did not consist only of individuals in good health. The mental health scores show that the early caregiving experience may not affect mental health in adulthood in a universally negative and pervasive manner.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined whether parents' retirement influences their contacts (visits, telephone/letter) with adult children outside the household. Design and Methods: The study relied on data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The sample consisted of parent–adult child dyads where parents were aged 55–75 at time 2 and adult children resided outside the household at both waves (N = 2,153 parent–adult child dyads, based on reports from 792 parents). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard errors were used. Results: Retirement has no significant effect on telephone contacts. Retired parents maintain frequent visits with children. For children living within 10 miles, mothers' retirement is associated with fewer and fathers' retirement with more visits. This trend varies by number of children, length of retirement, and child's gender. For children living more than 10 miles away, retired mothers decrease visits with childless children, whereas retired fathers increase visits with childless children. Implications:We attribute these findings to the gender-specific salience of child contacts for retirees and suggest that future research address children's and parents' expectations for postretirement contacts.   Gender ,  Intergenerational relations ,  Kin relationships Laurence G. Branch, PhDDespite considerable interest both in the consequences of retirement and in the predictors of parent–adult child contacts, few studies have linked these two research areas. Studies addressing retirement effects typically focus either on social contacts or social networks in general (Bosse, Aldwin, Levenson, Spiro, and Mroczek 1993   ; Bosse, Aldwin, Levenson, Workman-Daniels, and Ekerdt 1990   ; Bosse and Ekerdt 1981   ; Francis 1990   ; George, Fillenbaum, and Palmore 1984   ; Van Tilburg 1992   ), whereas investigations into parent–adult child relationships center on familial factors such as geographical distance, emotional attachment, or feelings of obligation (Lawton, Silverstein, and Bengtson 1994   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ). Yet, life-course theories stress that work and family spheres are interdependent, and that events in one sphere can influence events or relationships in the other sphere (Bengtson and Allen 1993   ; Moen 1996   ). Investigation of changes in kin contacts after retirement also has relevance for retirement preparation and counseling. Both parents and adult children may either feel uncertainty or have unrealistic expectations about their relationship after the parents' retirement (Szinovacz, Ekerdt, and Vinick 1992   ). For example, parents may expect enhanced support from children that the children are unable or unwilling to provide (Remnet 1987   ), and adult children may expect increased time commitments on the part of retired parents (e.g., to take care of grandchildren) that interfere with parents' planned retirement activities. Such scenarios may generate conflict between generations and undermine parents' adaptation to the retirement transition. This study addresses retirement effects on parents' contacts with their adult children, using panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Literature Review Evidence on retirement-related changes in social contacts is scarce and inconsistent. George and colleagues 1984    report an increase in time spent with friends among both women and men, whereas Bosse and coworkers 1993    find a decrease in quantitative but stability in qualitative social supports among men who retired. A smaller study of retiring men (Van Tilburg 1992   ) indicates that the overall size of social networks remained relatively stable over the retirement transition, but at the same time there was considerable fluctuation of network members. Relationships with relatives tended to be more stable than those with friends or acquaintances. These inconsistent results are hardly surprising, as these studies rely on data from divergent samples and periods and use quite different measures of social contacts or supports.Whereas research pertaining to the retirement transition has focused on social network changes, investigations of parent–adult child relationships are typically cross-sectional and mostly ignore parents' employment status. These studies demonstrate continued close bonds between parents and adult children into parents' later years (Eggebeen and Davey 1998   ; Lawton et al. 1994   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ). The extent of interactions seems to depend on gender and geographical distance (Lawton et al. 1994   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ) as well as on status transitions of both parents and children such as parents' divorce and remarriage (Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998   ). The few studies considering parents' employment status yield inconsistent results. Rossi and Rossi 1990    show that mothers' full-time employment is associated with reduced face-to-face contacts with sons, whereas sons report more contacts (visits and phone) with full-time employed fathers. Logan and Spitze 1996    report no significant effects of employment status on visits or telephone contacts between parents and adult children.In summary, current research provides some evidence that both parents' and adult children's employment status can influence intergenerational relations, and that retirement impinges on social networks. However, the extent and direction of these effects remain unclear, and there is essentially no information linking parents' retirement to contacts with their adult children. Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses In view of the separate treatment of retirement and intergenerational issues in past research, our theoretical approach integrates insights from both research traditions. Studies of postretirement activities and well-being typically proceed from the assumption that adaptation to loss of the work role requires a reorganization of retirees' activities (Kosloski, Ginsburg, and Backman 1984   ). It is not clear, however, what type of reorganization is best suited to compensate for the loss of work-related gratifications. Some argue that engagement in new activities is most beneficial, while others stress the importance of continuity in retirees' lives (Atchley 1976   , Atchley 1999   ; Friedman and Havighurst 1954   ).The broadest theoretical approach to intergenerational relations is the intergenerational solidarity framework developed by Roberts, Richards, and Bengtson 1991   . These researchers distinguish six interdependent dimensions of intergenerational solidarity (structural, normative, functional, associational, affectional, and consensual). They further demonstrate that associational solidarity (contact among family members, the dimension of solidarity that constitutes the dependent variable in this study) is influenced by normative and affectional solidarity, that is, norms and feelings of closeness (Roberts and Bengtson 1990   ). Other research shows that structural solidarity (geographical distance) has a strong impact on contacts among family members (Logan and Spitze 1996   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ). An alternative approach by Cicirelli 1989    emphasizes the importance of attachment, obligation, and dependency (or needs) for kin relationships. The first two dimensions are akin to affectional and normative solidarity, whereas dependency introduces the notion of needs as predictor of kin interactions and supports (Davey and Eggebeen 1998   ). More recently, researchers (Belliston, Davey, and Bookout 1999   ; Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998   ) have begun to explore ways in which changing needs and resources of each generation might affect changes and generational differences in intergenerational solidarity. This approach underlines the importance of considering intergenerational relationships from a dyadic level (i.e., one that considers parents' relationships with each child separately).Based on this earlier work, we suggest that kin contacts are affected by opportunity structures (especially time constraints and geographical distance), feelings of obligation (norms), and the salience of specific kin relationships. Salience most likely derives from affectional solidarity, as well as from family members' needs for kin interactions. It is important to consider these dimensions for each family member involved in kin interactions. Thus, parent–adult child contacts will depend on both parents' and children's opportunity structures and on parents' and children's feelings of obligation and salience.We further contend that reorganization of kin contacts after parents' retirement will reflect these influences. However, we lack adequate data to establish the impact of normative solidarity (the NSFH only contains data on attitudes toward coresidence and financial supports, which probably have little relevance for norms pertaining to associational solidarity). Consequently, our hypotheses focus on salience and constraints. Whether retired parents strive to enhance contacts with their children will depend foremost on whether such contacts can compensate for the role loss experienced upon retirement and thus the salience of contacts with the children. Specifically, contacts with children can compensate for the loss of social contacts with work colleagues, and they can provide the basis for identity enhancement in the roles of parent and grandparent. Because we lack a direct measure of kin salience, we rely on indicators that have been linked to salience of kin relations in past research. Earlier investigations suggest that salience of kin interactions is influenced by gender. Specifically, women seem to attach more importance to and are more involved in kin interactions than men (Logan and Spitze 1996   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ), although men also seem to derive some gratification from the grandparent role (Spitze and Ward 1998   ). In addition, the salience of contacts may vary by child's gender. Earlier studies indicate the importance of same-sex ties (Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998   ). This implies that mothers may derive more gratification from interactions with daughters, whereas men may gain more satisfaction from contacts with sons. Salience of child contacts will also depend on whether retired parents have alternative roles that may satisfy their social and identity needs, most importantly the marital role. Married men in particular seem to obtain fulfillment of social needs outside the work role foremost from their spouses (Antonucci and Akiyama 1995   ). In addition, emotional closeness to specific children will likely determine salience of contacts with these children after retirement. We thus hypothesize that retired parents will seek increased contacts with adult children if they feel close to the child, if the parents are not married (this applies particularly to male retirees), and if the child has children. We further hypothesize that women will be more inclined to enhance contacts with daughters, whereas men will be more likely to increase contacts with sons.Previous research further suggests that adaptation to retirement may proceed in stages. Retirees initially engage in nonroutine projects and activities such as travel or geographical moves that tend to be exciting and satisfying but of relatively short duration (the so-called "honeymoon" period; see Atchley 1976   ; Ekerdt, Bosse, and Levkoff 1985   ). This period is followed by the establishment of a more enduring retirement lifestyle. We suggest that enhanced contacts with adult children are more likely to be a pattern established in this latter period. Thus, we hypothesize that enhancement in contacts will be more likely among parents who have been retired for two or more years.Although salience of kin relationships is likely to influence whether retirees direct their search for compensating postretirement activities toward interactions with kin, the implementation of such aspirations can be limited by deficient opportunity, particularly geographical distance and time constraints. As noted earlier, geographical distance has been consistently linked to frequency of association with kin (Logan and Spitze 1996   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ). Support for the impact of other constraints is limited and inconsistent. There is some indication that children's employment may curtail relations with their parents (Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ). Another constraint may derive from the number of children. Although having numerous children seems to enhance parents' ability to see any child (Uhlenberg and Cooney 1990   ), it is not clear how number of children influences contacts with each individual child. Recent research on grandparenthood suggests, for example, that individual grandparent–grandchild contacts decline with the number of grandchildren (Uhlenberg and Hammill 1998   ). Similarly, parents with more children are obliged to divide attention among children, which may reduce interactions with each individual child. We thus hypothesize that post–retirement increases in parent–adult child contacts should be more pronounced for parent–child dyads who live close to each other, and that they should be less pronounced for full-time employed children and for parents with numerous children. Methods Sample The analyses rely on data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), conducted in 1987–88 and 1992–94. The NSFH is a multistage area probability sample with oversamples for minorities and selected other groups (e.g., one-parent families, families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and recently married individuals). Data were collected from a randomly selected household member aged 19 or more, his/her spouse, and, in some cases, a tertiary household member. First-wave interview response rates for the successfully screened households were 73.5% for the main sample and 76.8% for the oversample, resulting in a total sample of 13,008 respondents (for a detailed description of the study, see Sweet, Bumpass, and Call 1988   ). The wave 2 interviews were completed by 10,005 respondents. We use weights to adjust for nonresponses at time 1 and attrition at time 2.Because our analyses focus on changes in contacts brought about by the retirement transition, we selected a subsample at risk of retirement. This subsample consists of respondents aged 55–75 at time 2 who were employed 10 hours or more at time 1 and had adult children outside the household at both times. The age range corresponds with typical retirement ages, and the restriction to 10 hours of employment ensures that parents pursued some regular employment preceding retirement. However, only very few respondents (2.2%) worked fewer than 10 hours at baseline. In addition, we excluded from the sample those parents who reported receipt of health care from any adult child (5.3%). This restriction is necessary to avoid confounding of associational (social contacts) and functional (supports) solidarity and to ensure that potential increases in contacts are not due to changes in parents' health and need for care. As NSFH respondents reported on contacts with each adult child, the data were accumulated for each parent–child dyad. Thus, the parent–child dyads and not the parents are the primary unit of analysis (for a similar approach see Uhlenberg and Hammill 1998   ). The final unweighted sample size consisted of 2,153 parent–adult child dyads (based on responses from 792 parents). Not considered in the analyses were adult children for whom reports were only available at one wave (children who "disappeared" between waves or were first mentioned at time 2), as well as children who moved into or out of their parents' household. This is necessary because analysis of change in contacts requires comparable information at both waves. The data refer exclusively to adult children who were age 19 or older at baseline.Nonresponses in panel data can lead to biased results when cases with missing data are dropped from the analyses (Little and Rubin 1987   ), especially when data are not missing completely at random (MCAR) as is the case for our analyses. We therefore created five complete-case data sets using the regression method provided by SPSS (SPSS 1997   ). The data shown in the tables are based on multiple imputation inference using NORM (Schafer 1997   ) from analyses performed on these five data sets. To assess the sensitivity of our findings to the imputation methods used here, we compared our results with those obtained using the expectation–maximization method, as well as reliance on nonimputed data (listwise deletion), yielding highly similar findings in each case. This suggests that results are fairly stable and only minimally affected by the imputation method.Respondents are close to or at retirement age (M = 62.8), and 56% are women. Eighteen percent of the sample are Black and 6% are from other minorities. Sixty-one percent of respondents were married at time 2. Education is slightly above the high school level (M = 12.3 years). Most respondents (65%) worked full time at baseline, and 45% retired between waves. The adult children are equally divided by gender; 64% of the children are themselves parents, and 76% were employed full time at time 2. More than one third of the children (36%) lived within 10 miles of their parents at time 2. Children's ages varied considerably (range = 23 to 55; M = 37). Dependent Variables Two dependent variables were used in the analyses: visits and telephone/letter contacts at time 2. Note that in all cases the analyses relied on the parents' reports. Frequency of visits and letter/telephone contacts was measured with the question: During the last 12 months, how often did you see (talk on the telephone or receive a letter) from [child]? Answer categories were: 1 = not at all, 2 = once a year, 3 = several times a year, 4 = 1–3 times a month, 5 = once a week, 6 = more than once a week. Wave 1 visits and telephone/letter contacts were included as predictor variables in all analyses. Thus, the dependent variables reflect contacts at time 2 net of contacts at time 1. At time 1, respondents reported seeing their children on average several times a month (M = 3.99) and to have somewhat more frequent telephone/letter contacts (M = 4.54). Independent Variables The major independent variable is parents' retirement. We rely on full withdrawal from the labor force to measure retirement. This definition may differ from self-definition as retiree (Ekerdt and DeViney 1990   ; Szinovacz and DeViney 1999   ). Because employment-related time constraints limit parents' ability to interact with children or to travel to visit children, it is most likely that parents' withdrawal from the labor force (rather than retirement from the main career job) precipitates changes in contacts with children. Length of retirement was operationalized by subdividing retirees into those retired less than 2 years and those retired 2 years or more. This dichotomy corresponds with our hypothesis concerning a potential honeymoon effect. Preliminary analyses further indicate that there are no differences between those retired 2–3 years and those retired longer. Date of retirement was only assessed in the questionnaires given to respondents and has a relatively high number of missing values (7%). Because imputation of missing values for a subpopulation (retirees) is problematic, we developed an extra category for missing cases and included this category in the analyses. Thus, the reference group consists exclusively of persons who did not retire between waves.Additional independent variables are parents' and children's gender, parents' marital status, parents' perceived emotional closeness to each child (measured at baseline), the number of children each parent has outside the household, children's parental status, children's employment, and geographical distance. Gender of both parents and children was dummy-coded (female = 1, male = 0).Parents' marital status was coded into two dummy variables, those married and those widowed at time 2. Divorcees and the very few never-married parents are the reference. This distinction reflects earlier research findings indicating that it is divorced parents, especially, who may lose contacts with their children (Kaufman and Uhlenberg 1998   ). In addition, change in marital status between waves was controlled in the analyses.Parents' emotional closeness to each child was only measured at baseline. Parents were asked to describe their relationship with each child (1 = very poor, 7 = excellent).Number of parents' children refers exclusively to adult children outside the household, as these are the children of interest in this study. Because of the distribution of this variable (fewer than 5% have only one child outside the household), we differentiate among parents who have only one or two children, those with three children, and those with four or more children. Although children in the household will also compete for parents' attention, contacts with these children are not subject to change. However, change in household composition was controlled in the analyses.Children's parental status was treated as a dichotomous variable (1 = child has biological children in the household; reference = child has no biological children living in the household).Measurement of children's employment status is based on the question: Is (child) currently working full time, part time, or not at all? This information was only provided at time 2. We differentiate between children employed full time and those employed part time or not at all. Preliminary analyses indicated that there is no difference in contacts between part-time and not employed children.Measurement of geographic distance is based on parents' reports of how far away (in miles) each child lived at time 1 and time 2. In line with earlier research (Rossi and Rossi 1990   ), we use 10 miles as the criterion for distinguishing children who live within parents' immediate neighborhood from those living outside the parents' immediate neighborhood. In addition, change in distance between waves was controlled in all analyses.Other controls included in the analyses are race, whether parents worked full time at baseline, parents' limitations in activities of daily living at time 2, change in parents' self-reported health, change in parents' income, change in spouse's employment status between waves, whether the child is the biological child of the respondent's spouse, changes in parents' and children's marital status between waves, and children's age. Means and standard deviations of all variables (including controls) are shown in  Table 1  . Data Analyses Our analyses refer to parent–adult child dyads. This means that parents with more than one adult child are represented more than once in the data set and observations are not independent. Under such circumstances, standard statistical procedures yield downwardly biased standard errors. To overcome this problem, our analyses rely on generalized estimating equations (GEE; see Liang and Zeger 1986   ) with clusters for family unit (parent's identification number), using a random-effects model and additional adjustments for robust standard errors with the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance (Stata 1997   ). Coefficients obtained from GEE are akin to unstandardized linear regression coefficients, although Stata does not provide standardized estimates or R-square statistics.Interactions were tested in line with standard regression procedures, that is, equations with higher order interactions were tested first and include all lower order interaction terms (Aiken and West 1991   ). We started with the highest order terms allowed by subgroup distribution, which are triple interactions. We first tested interactions by parents' gender, geographical distance to each child, and retirement. As this interaction proved to be significant, we performed all subsequent analyses separately for children living within 10 miles of the parent and children living further away. We then tested for interactions by parent's gender, parent's retirement, and each of the other hypothesized contingencies (child's gender, parent's marital status, emotional closeness to the child, number of children, child's parental status, child's employment) in separate equations (e.g., Parent's gender × Parent's retirement × Child's gender). If the higher order term was not significant, the next lower order term was tested (e.g., Child's gender × Retirement, Parent's gender × Retirement). This procedure provides some assurance that multiple interaction terms do not evolve through multicollinearity among the interaction terms. In case of significant interactions, we further estimated outcomes (frequency of contacts) for the pertinent subgroups from the regression equations (Aiken and West 1991   ). These results are not shown in the tables but are described in the Discussion section.Tests for multicollinearity were performed. Variance inflation (Fox 1991   ) for the full model with controls (but without the interaction terms) yielded a mean VIF of 1.30. This indicates that multicollinearity is not a problem in our analyses. Results The main objective of our analyses was to establish whether parent–adult child contacts are affected by parents' retirement, and whether such effects are contingent on selected parent and child characteristics. The first step in our analyses was to establish whether retirement has any effect on visits or telephone contacts. Preliminary analyses (not shown) indicate that retirement does influence visits, but there are no effects for telephone contacts. Because telephone contacts are not influenced by retirement, all additional analyses pertain to visits.Having established that visits are affected by retirement, we explored predicted contingencies of this effect. We first examined whether retirement effects differ for contacts with children living nearby (within 10 miles) and those living further away, and whether such effects vary by parent's gender. These analyses (see  Table 2  , first data column) substantiate that the Retirement × Distance × Parent's gender interaction is significant. Inspection of the interaction indicates that among parent–child dyads living within 10 miles of each other, mothers who retired see their children less frequently than mothers who remained employed, whereas retired fathers report more frequent visits than continuously employed fathers. Among parent–child dyads who do not live close to each other, visits occur less frequently and are similar for employed and retired men and women.In view of the strong effect of geographical distance, we tested the other hypothesized relationships separately for parent–child dyads living within 10 miles of each other and those living further apart. In addition to parents' gender, we expected children's gender to affect changes in contacts after retirement. Our analyses confirm that children's gender has some influence on retirement-related changes in visits ( Table 2  , model 1). Specifically, retirees (both fathers and mothers) seem to increase visits with daughters and slightly reduce contacts with sons. This effect is restricted to parent–child dyads living close to each other.Salience of post-retirement contacts was also predicted to vary by children's parental status. This effect is confirmed for parent–child dyads living more than 10 miles apart and varies by parent's gender (see  Table 2  , second data column). Mothers seem to maintain a relatively high level of contacts with children who are themselves parents, regardless of the mother's employment status. In contrast, mothers' visits with childless children seem to decline after retirement. Fathers increase contacts with childless children after they retire but decrease visits with children who are parents. Among parent–child dyads living within 10 miles of each other, child's parenthood has no effect on post-retirement changes in visits.Salience was also expected to be reflected in parents' feelings of closeness to the child and in parents' needs (based on their marital status). We find no support for either hypothesis. Retirement-related changes in visits are not contingent on parents' feelings of closeness to the child nor on their marital status.Our final hypothesis pertaining to salience of post-retirement contacts referred to length of retirement. We expected a stronger influence for parents who were past the honeymoon period, that is, those retired 2 years or more. The data confirm that length of retirement matters ( Table 2  , model 3). It is primarily mothers retired 2 years or more who decrease visits with children living nearby. Retired fathers, on the other hand, report more visits with nearby children regardless of length of retirement, although this trend is particularly pronounced for fathers retired under 2 years. Length of retirement has no impact on visits with children living more than 10 miles away.In addition to geographical distance, we expected children's employment and number of children to constrain parents' aspirations for post-retirement contacts. We find no support for an influence of children's employment status. Number of children outside the household does moderate retirement effects for parent–child dyads living within 10 miles of each other ( Table 2  , model 2). Mothers' retirement seems to lead to a decline in visits primarily if they have four or more children outside the household. In contrast, fathers are particularly prone to increase contacts after retirement if they have four or more children, whereas fathers of one or two children outside the household tend to have fewer post-retirement visits with these children. Among parent-child dyads living more than 10 miles apart, number of children does not moderate retirement effects. Discussion Our analyses were guided by the assumption that contacts with adult children may help retirees compensate for the loss of social contacts at work and provide them with identity-enhancing activities in the roles of parent and grandparent. We further hypothesized that such social and identity-enhancing opportunities may be curtailed by geographical distance and time constraints.Our results suggest that retirement has some effect on visits between parents and their adult children, whereas telephone contacts seem to be unaffected by parents' retirement. That we find no retirement effects on telephone contacts is hardly surprising. Telephone contacts are less likely to be constrained by parents' employment, and they also are unlikely to compensate for loss of the work role. This finding does suggest, however, that visits and telephone contacts have a different meaning and consequently should be treated separately. Some earlier studies combine these two types of associational solidarity (e.g., Lawton et al. 1994   ).Retirement effects on visits are quite complex and are contingent on a variety of circumstances. Given the constraints associated with long-distance relationships, we expected retirement to have only a modest impact on visits with children living more than 10 miles from their parents. This hypothesis was partially supported: Retirement effects occur foremost among parent–child dyads living close to each other. However, consideration of the child's parental status somewhat modifies this conclusion. Among mothers, the grandparent role seems to override potential employment-related constraints, leading to fairly constant contacts over the retirement transition with adult children who are themselves parents. On the other hand, mothers' contacts with distant childless children decline after retirement, suggesting that such contacts have little appeal to mothers as a post-retirement endeavor or that childless children are particularly uninterested in contacts with retired mothers. The opposite holds for fathers' contacts with distant children, that is, after retirement they visit slightly more with childless children and slightly less with children who are parents. As these differences are fairly small, they must be interpreted with caution. Perhaps retired fathers obtain more gratification from adult-to-adult contacts with children than from greater involvement in a distant grandparent role.Changes in post-retirement visits with children living nearby vary by child's gender, as well as by parents' gender, length of retirement, and number of children. To the extent that retired parents increase contacts with nearby children at all, such increases seem to occur primarily with daughters. This finding contradicts our assumption that retired parents may seek out activities with same-sex children. It might indicate that daughters are more inclined than sons to accommodate retired parents' needs for enhanced contacts. It is also conceivable, however, that contacts with daughters (who may be more socialized toward maintaining close relations with parents and more attuned to parents' needs) are more gratifying to retirees.Parents' gender and length of retirement jointly influence contacts with children living within 10 miles of the parent. Contrary to our hypothesis, retired mothers tend to spend less and retired fathers more time with children than their employed counterparts. For mothers, this trend seems to become more pronounced with length of retirement and number of children, whereas it is fairly stable for fathers. We attribute this difference to the gendered division of labor throughout men's and women's working years. Employed mothers typically carry the main burden of family work, leaving them little time to engage in leisure activities (Ferree 1991   ; Lopata 1995   ). In contrast, men are less involved in kin work (Antonucci and Akiyama 1995   ; Rossi and Rossi 1990   ), and especially employed men devote little time to other family work such as household activities or child care (Ferree 1991   ). This means that men and women enter retirement under quite different circumstances. Retired men may very well feel that they neglected contacts with their children while working and use their extra time to "catch up" when opportunity allows (i.e., when the children live nearby). Retired women, on the other hand, will usually have maintained close ties with their children throughout their working years and may feel less of a need to reestablish a close relationship. In retirement they may see their first opportunity to engage in personal leisure activities. As the trend toward reduced contacts is most prominent among women with several children, it may reflect special needs for personal leisure among women who had been heavily burdened by multiple responsibilities. Furthermore, married women often take charge of the couple's retirement activities (Keating and Cole 1980   ), and this responsibility may detract from their increasing contacts with adult children. It is also possible that children are particularly amenable to enhance contacts with retired fathers, with whom they probably had fewer contacts in the past. Contacts with retired mothers, on the other hand, may lack novelty, and mothers' attempts to enhance contacts may be perceived as an imposition by their children (Remnet 1987   ).We further hypothesized that time constraints may inhibit enhanced contacts with children after retirement. We find no support for the assumption that children's employment would moderate the impact of retirement. The second predicted constraint, number of children, does moderate retirement effects on contacts but not in the expected direction. Retired fathers are particularly likely to enhance contacts with nearby children if they have four or more children, whereas retired mothers' tendency to decrease contacts with nearby children prevails among mothers with four or more children outside the household. For mothers of multiple children, gratifications derived from the parent role may be saturated, and they may consequently seek other endeavors in retirement. The finding for fathers could reflect multiple opportunities, that is, fathers with several adult children have more opportunity for contacts and apparently take advantage of this opportunity. It is also conceivable that fathers of multiple children are more kin-oriented than men with fewer children and thus more inclined to gear retirement activities toward contacts with their children.Taken together, our findings indicate that retired parents' contacts with their adult children depend on selected parent and child characteristics. This suggests that both parents' and children's expectations and wishes, as well as selected constraints (especially geographical distance), impinge on parents' post-retirement contacts with their children. As we lack data on either parents' or children's desired contact frequency, we cannot establish whether the observed patterns reflect either party's wishes or what type of compromises parents and children reach. For example, retired mothers may decrease contacts with children to pursue other endeavors, or their children may reduce contacts to avoid potential imposition by retired mothers. If retirees' expectations are not met, they may be forced to amend their plans for post-retirement activities. Some parents may also exert pressure on their children to meet their expectations. Either scenario is likely to kindle conflicts between retired parents and their children.It is also important to note that, although all discussed interactions effects are significant and contribute significantly to model fit, the observed differences in contact frequency are quite small, suggesting considerable continuity in parent–child contacts over the retirement transition. This would suggest that post-retirement contacts with children have only limited importance as a source for retirees' social contact and identity enhancement needs. This finding is in line with earlier research suggesting that retirees derive more satisfaction from contacts with friends than from contacts with relatives (Dorfman, Heckert, Hill, and Kohout 1988   ). It is only under special conditions that parents seek fulfillment of such needs through contacts with their children. Furthermore, our analyses, based on all parent–adult child dyads, essentially provide a weighted (by family size) average of contacts for parents who have more than one adult child. Thus, it is quite possible that retired parents simultaneously increase contacts with one child and decrease contacts with another. Such selective changes in contacts with specific children are reflected in relationships pertaining to child characteristics but not in relationships pertaining to parent characteristics.Our findings may also be subject to methodological and data limitations. We lack indicators for some key variables (e.g., a direct measure of kin salience) and have rather poor measures for other indicators (e.g., affectional solidarity). Indeed, our failure to find a moderating effect of perceived closeness on post-retirement contacts most likely can be attributed to measurement quality and the very skewed distribution of the closeness variable (most parents reported feeling extremely close to their children). In view of these caveats, further research is clearly needed. Most important would be comparisons of expectations and aspirations for post-retirement contacts on the part of parents and children, and assessment of the implementation of such expectations after retirement. Future studies should also explore retirement effects on other dimensions of intergenerational solidarity and further subgroup variations in retirement effects (e.g., by race).Despite their limitations, our findings lend themselves to some recommendations for retirement planners and family counselors. They suggest that gender-stereotyped expectations about men's and women's post-retirement activities (women will spend time with kids, men will go to the golf course) may not fit reality. Similarly, we find little support for the bumper-sticker notion that retired parents will leave their children behind and devote their retirement leisure exclusively to nonfamily pursuits. Retired parents do keep in close touch with their adult children. Thus, retirement planners and family counselors need not be concerned that retirees will "abandon" their children. Rather, concern should be directed toward the implementation of realistic plans for post-retirement kin relationships and toward both generations' ability to compromise on a level of contact that meets parents' and children's expectations and needs.

     Abstract Purpose: This study sought to determine the prevalence and profile of grandparents providing extensive care for a grandchild (grandparents who provide 30+ hours per week or 90+ nights per year of child care, yet are not the primary caregiver of the grandchild). Design and methods: Secondary analysis of the 3,260 grandparent respondents in the 1992–94 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Extensively caregiving grandparents were compared with custodial grandparents (those with primary responsibility for raising a grandchild for 6+ months), noncaregivers, occasional caregivers (<10 hours per week), and intermediate caregivers using chi-square tests, one-way analysis of variance tests, and logistic regression analyses. Results: Close to 7% of all grandparents provided extensive caregiving, as did 14.9% of those who had provided any grandchild care in the last month. Extensive caregivers most closely resembled custodial caregivers and had least in common with those grandparents who never provided child care. Implications: Areas for future research, policy, and practice are highlighted, including the potential impact of welfare reform legislation on extensively caregiving grandparents.   Family child care ,  Grandparent caregiving ,  Later-life families Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe last decade has seen increasing awareness among health and social service providers, researchers, policy makers, and the general public of the substantial number of grandparents who provide child care on a regular basis to their grandchildren. As Hirshorn 1998    has pointed out, such activities as routinely getting young children ready for school in the mornings, providing full-time child care for preschoolers, or serving as a custodial parent to children whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide care "move the grandparent out of the more traditional older-generation-in-the-family roles … and into roles typically assumed by a child's parents" (p. 200). As she further noted:In so doing, grandparent caregiving stretches, reorganizes, and redefines the relationships between family members; redraws the boundaries of family and, often, of household units; and redirects the transfer of resources within the family (Hirshorn 1998   , p. 200).Since 1970, two notable and diverging trends in grandparent care for grandchildren have been observed. On the one hand, this period saw a dramatic 76% increase in the number of children under 18 living in households maintained by a grandparent. The number of children in such households grew from 2.2 million (3.2%) in 1970 to 3.9 million (5.5%) in 1997, with particularly rapid growth since 1980 (Lugaila 1998   ). In an estimated one third of these homes neither parent was present and, since 1990, by far the fastest growth has been in these "skipped generation" households (Casper and Bryson 1998   ) in which grandparents are typically the sole or primary caregiver. A number of factors help explain the increase in grandparents raising grandchildren, including parental substance abuse, teen pregnancy, AIDS, unemployment, and incarceration, as well as legal and policy changes favoring kinship care over other placement arrangements (Burnette 1997   ; Minkler 1999   ).Although custodial care among grandparents has increased substantially, the proportion of young children for whom noncustodial grandparents and other relatives are the main source of child care has declined dramatically, corresponding to the rise in more formal center-based child care arrangements. A fivefold increase in center-based child care (from 6% to 30% of all child care arrangements) occurred between 1965 and 1993, whereas family day care use remained constant at about 17% and nonparental relative care declined from 33% to 25% (Hofferth 1996   ). When the discussion is confined to preschool children whose mothers work full time, 1993 census data indicate that more than one million preschoolers are cared for by their grandparents (Casper 1996   ). This figure represents 16.6% of preschoolers whose mothers work full time (Casper 1996   ) and 5.4% of all preschoolers (U.S. Census Bureau 2000   ).Increased female labor force participation (affecting both young mothers and midlife grandmothers), the rise in single-headed households (leaving mothers with fewer relatives to call upon for assistance), and a growing parental belief in the value of nonfamily child care in socializing young children for school appear largely to have spurred these changes (Hofferth 1996   ). Although noncustodial grandparents no longer constitute the primary source of nonparental child care for children, they remain frequently called-upon sources of child care on a regular basis. Research by Baydar and Brooks-Gunn 1998    using 1987–88 data from the National Survey of Families and Households, for example, suggested that 43% of grandparents provided child care for their grandchildren at least once monthly. Similarly, Bass and Caro 1996    research, using national field poll data, found that 32% of individuals with grandchildren or great grandchildren had provided care for at least one hour during the previous week. Of those providing care, 13.6 hours constituted the average time devoted to this activity. Data like these are helpful in highlighting the high proportion of grandparents who provide at least some care to their grandchildren on a weekly or monthly basis. Yet, they tell us little about those grandparents who, while not defining themselves as the primary caregiver of their grandchildren, nevertheless provide extensive child care on a regular basis.Surprisingly few studies have focused primarily on grandparents who play a substantial role in caring for their grandchildren without crossing the line to become primary caregivers (Caputo 1999   ). In one such study, Presser 1989    examined the economic complexities involved in child care provision by grandparents who were providing substantial caregiving to assist a parent and concluded that the juggling of work and family roles in these situations may be substantial. Folk and Beller 1993    research also examined the provision of child care by relatives within the context of maternal employment, noting a continued preference for such care, particularly for very young (<age 3) children. Finally, several researchers have examined the often extensive child care and related roles of grandmothers in assisting their teenage daughters who have become mothers (Burton and Bengtson 1985   ; Flaherty 1988   ; Cherlin and Furstenberg 1986   ).The present study was designed to provide a profile of American grandparents who provide extensive secondary child care to their grandchildren, and to compare and contrast this population group with those who are not providing such care along a variety of social and demographic dimensions. To increase our understanding of the continuum of child care provision for grandchildren, a typology was created that enabled us to conduct five-way comparisons. We compared (1) noncustodial extensive child care providers, (2) grandparents who self-defined as having been the primary caregiver for their grandchildren (custodial grandparents), (3) grandparents providing no child care (noncaregiver), (4) grandparents providing <10 hours a week of child care for their grandchildren (occasional caregivers), and (5) grandparents providing 10–29 hours of care (intermediate caregivers). Methods Sample The grandparents analyzed in this study were a subsample drawn from the larger two-wave nationally representative panel study, the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The surveys were conducted by the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1992, 1993, or 1994, 10,008 respondents were interviewed. They comprise 77% of the original 13,008 respondents interviewed during the first wave of data collection in 1987 and 1988. Questions on grandparent caregiving only occurred in the second wave of data collection; therefore, all analyses reported here are restricted to the 1992–1994 data. In the second wave, 3,477 reported having one or more grandchildren. Once we deleted from the sample those who had provided custodial care during the 1980s or earlier but who were no longer doing so during the 1990s and those who had missing information on care provision, 3,260 subjects remained. Of these remaining respondents, 223 provided extensive caregiving during the second wave of interviews, 173 were custodial grandparents during the 1990s, 1,319 provided no care, and 757 provided occasional care. An additional 788 grandparents provided intermediate care.In order to adjust for nonresponse and for oversampling of ethnic minorities, nontraditional families, and recently married people, a weighting variable was constructed by the NSFH. This weighting represents a sample that is demographically representative of the coterminous United States. All analyses reported in this study are weighted. (Further details on the study design and questions can be found in Sweet, Bumpass, and Call 1988   ). Measures As noted above, we developed five categories: one self-defined primary caregiver category (custodial grandparents) and four groups who did not define themselves as the primary caregiver (extensive, intermediate, occasional, and noncaregivers)."Extensive" caregivers were providing a significant proportion of their grandchild's care although they did not report themselves as the primary caregiver. We operationalized this variable in two ways: Grandparents were included if they (1) provided at least 30 hours of child care in an average week and/or (2) cared for grandchildren for at least 90 nights per year.Thirty hours a week was decided upon as the cutpoint in the first instance because it reflects a substantial portion of the grandparents' week—approximately 6 hours a day for 5 days. To determine grandparents in the NSFH who provided 30 or more hours a week babysitting, a proxy measure was constructed. All respondents were asked how many hours in an average week they spent helping their child and/or children age 19 or over, including all the following kinds of help: shopping and/or transportation; work around the house; advice or support; and child care. If the grandparents did not report having primary responsibility for raising a grandchild, yet they did state that they helped with child care and that they provided help for 30 or more hours a week, they were included in our subsample of 30+ hour-a-week child care providers. In the cases where the respondent provided child care and one or more of the other types of assistance to their adult children, it was assumed that child care represented the largest proportion of this time. The nonspecificity of the duration question leaves some room for false positives (e.g., inclusion of some people who provided child care for 10 hours and housework for 20 hours). However, the authors believe that this error will be relatively rare.Our second type of extensively caregiving grandparents reported that a grandchild and/or grandchildren stayed overnight at their house, without their parents present, for at least 90 nights per year. Ninety nights was chosen because this exceeds the average length of a child's summer holidays. Although taking care of a grandchild for 2 months in the summer reflects a significant contribution of energy and a life-style change, we felt that the 3-month cutpoint would limit the analysis to only the most heavily involved caregivers. If grandparents met the criteria for either form of caregiving, they were defined as "extensive caregivers" (n = 223). Note that we could not translate the nights per year into an average hours per week value and sum the combined value of the two types because in some cases nights may reflect only 8–12 hours of caregiving (e.g., while the grandchild's parent is working a night shift), whereas in other cases "nights" reflect 24 hour-a-day care (e.g., while the child visits for a month in the summer).Intermediate caregivers provided child care for a grandchild between 10 and 29 hours a week and/or had their grandchild stay overnight without his or her parent for 7 to 89 nights.Occasional caregivers provided between 1 and 9 hours of child care in an average week and/or had a grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents 1–6 days in the past year.Noncaregiving grandparents provided no babysitting during an average week and, in the past year, had not had a grandchild stay overnight without his or her parents.Custodial caregivers were grandparents who replied affirmatively to the question, "For various reasons, grandparents sometimes take on the primary responsibility for raising a grandchild. Have you ever had the primary responsibility for any of your grandchildren for 6 months or more?" and who reported beginning or ending caregiving during the 1990s. Caregivers who reported they had been primary caregivers but were no longer caregiving during the 1990s were removed from the sample so as not to confound the analysis. (For a more detailed discussion and analysis of this group, see Fuller-Thomson, Minkler, and Driver 1997   .)A total of 10 independent variables were included in the analyses. Demographic variables included age, gender, race (African American vs other), marital status (married vs other), education (high school completion vs not), geographic region (South vs other), and poverty status (above or below the poverty line). Familial variables included total number of grandchildren and location of nearest child (coresident, within 20 miles, more than 20 miles away). Finally, self-reported closeness to grandparents was measured using the question, "On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is ‘not at all close’ and 10 is ‘extremely close,’ how would you describe your relationship with your grandchild(ren)?" Statistical Analyses Overall prevalence of caregiving type was determined by generating a frequency of the five categories of caregivers for all grandparents. We also were interested in the percentage of extensive caregivers among three distinct subgroups of grandparents: (1) those who had at least one grandchild under age 5 (n = 1,950), (2) those who had provided some child care to their grandchildren during the previous month (n = 1,305), and (3) those who had provided at least some child care in the previous month for their grandchildren while their adult child was working (n = 813). These percentages were obtained through frequencies of caregiving type for each identified subsample.To determine differences among the caregiving type for demographic variables, chi-square tests were used for categorical variables, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used for interval and ratio level variables. For those variables that reached the level of significance, it was necessary to conduct a further test to determine which of the grandparent types differed significantly from the extensive caregiving category. For the ratio and interval level variables, Tukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc tests were conducted. For the categorical variables, subanalyses were conducted doing pair by pair chi-square comparisons. To keep the overall significance level at .05, the pairwise comparisons' significance level was reduced to .013 (from .05 for overall significance/4 sets of comparisons).In order to assess the independent contribution of each predictor variable while controlling for the other variables in the equation, it was necessary to conduct four logistic regression analyses with extensive caregiving coded 1 and the other four caregiving categories used in succession as the reference category. In the first case, the sample was restricted to extensive caregivers (n = 204) and noncaregivers (n = 1,174) who had complete data for all the independent variables in the analysis. In the second case, the sample included only extensive caregivers (n = 204) and occasional caregivers (n = 713) with complete data. The third analysis was limited to extensive caregivers (n = 204) and intermediate caregivers (n = 736) with complete data. The final analysis included only extensively caregiving grandparents (n = 204) and custodial caregivers (n = 151) with complete data. This method provided odds ratios for extensive caregivers in comparison to noncaregivers, occasional caregivers, intermediate caregivers, and custodial caregivers. In each analysis, all 10 independent variables were entered in a block.In addition to the odds ratios, two other statistics are reported: the R statistic and the Nagelkerke R-squared. The R-statistic measures the individual partial correlation between the dependent variable and each independent variable in logistic regression analyses (Norusis 1997   ). The Nagelkerke R-squared value is analogous to the R-square in a linear regression model (Norusis 1997   ). The larger the R-squared value, the greater the explanatory power of the combination of the independent variables. Results Using the four categories of caregivers defined above, 6.8% of all grandparents were serving as extensive caregivers at the time of the interview. In contrast, 40.4% of the grandparents in the total sample were noncaregivers, 23.3% were occasional caregivers, 24.2% were intermediate caregivers, and 5.3% had provided custodial care at some time during the 1990s. Grandparents who were providing both extensive and custodial care (n = 67) were classified as custodial caregivers—a fact which may have resulted in an underestimation of the proportion of extensive caregivers.Age of grandchildren clearly played an important role in influencing the likelihood of extensive care provision, with 9% of all grandparents with a grandchild under age 5 being extensive caregivers.Of grandparents interviewed during the 1990s, 1,305, or 40.4%, had provided some child care to their grandchildren during the previous month. Of these, 14.9% were extensive caregivers. When the sample was further restricted to the 813 respondents who had provided at least some child care in the previous month for their grandchildren while their adult child was working, the percentage of extensive caregivers rose to 20.2%.As indicated in  Table 1  , significant differences within the five categories of grandparents were evident for all the characteristics investigated. Post-hoc tests provided further information on which pairs within each analysis were significantly different.In comparison to noncaregivers, bivariate analyses indicated that extensive caregivers were significantly younger (56.4 vs 66.8 years), more likely to be married (73% vs 59%), African American (17% vs 9%), female (65% vs 52%), to have coresident children (51% vs 24%), and to have reported greater closeness to their grandchildren (9.6 vs 7.8 on a 10-point scale); see  Table 1  . The groups were statistically similar with respect to educational level, geographic region, income, proportion below the poverty line, and total number of grandchildren. In order to determine the individual contribution of each independent variable while other variables are held constant, a logistic regression analysis of extensive caregivers versus noncaregivers was performed (see  Table 2  ). This analysis showed that, in comparison to noncaregivers, the odds of being an extensively caregiving grandparent were 87% higher for married grandparents, 53% higher for grandmothers, and 77% lower for those who live more than 20 miles from all their children. The odds of being an extensive caregiver were higher for younger respondents (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92 for age), for those with more grandchildren (OR = 1.08), and for the grandparents who reported greater closeness to their grandchildren (OR = 1.73). The R statistic indicates that age and closeness to grandchildren are the variables in the model that provide the most explanatory power.In contrast with occasional caregivers, extensively caregiving grandparents were significantly younger (56.4 years vs 59.5 years) and more likely to be African American (17% vs 8%), female (65% vs 54%), to live in the South (43% vs 30%), and to have coresident children (51% vs 34%). Extensive caregivers were poorer than occasional caregivers; they had a lower mean income ($34,286 vs $47,389) and were more than twice as likely to live below the poverty line (18% vs 8%). Extensive caregivers were less likely to have graduated from high school (67% vs 81%) and reported greater closeness with their grandchildren (mean scores of 9.6 vs 9 on a 10-point scale); see  Table 1  . The logistic regression analysis comparing extensive and occasional caregivers, reported in  Table 2  , indicates that respondents who lived below the poverty line had 89% higher odds and high school graduates had 37% lower odds of being extensive caregivers. In comparison to those who had coresident children, the odds of extensive caregiving were low for those whose nearest child lived nearby and even lower for those whose nearest child was more than 20 miles away (OR = 0.63 and 0.50, respectively). Those who reported greater closeness with their grandchildren also had higher odds of providing extensive care (OR = 1.32).In comparison to intermediate caregivers, extensive caregivers were significantly younger (56.4 years vs 58.9 years), more likely to be African American (17% vs 11%) and to have coresident children (51% vs 32%), and less likely to be a high school graduate (67% vs 77%); see  Table 1  . Extensive caregivers earned, on average, approximately $7500 less per year and were 6% more likely to be living below the poverty line than intermediate caregivers. The logistic regression analysis (see  Table 2  ) indicates that extensive caregivers had much lower odds than intermediate caregivers of all their children living outside the grandparent's home. The odds were 47% lower that the children of extensive grandparents lived between 1–20 miles from the home as opposed to being coresident. The odds of children living more than 20 miles from the grandparent's home were 57% lower for extensive caregivers.Custodial and extensive caregivers were similar with respect to most characteristics (see  Table 1  ). However, extensive caregivers were more likely to be married (73% vs 54%) and less likely to be African American (17% vs 27%) or female (65% vs 77%). Extensive caregiving grandparents also had fewer grandchildren than did their custodial caregiving peers (5.2 vs 7.3 grandchildren). In the logistic regression analyses, married respondents had twice the odds of being extensive caregivers (see  Table 2  ). With each additional grandchild, the probability of providing extensive as opposed to custodial care decreased by 5%. Discussion The fact that 6.8% of the grandparents in this national sample were currently caring for a grandchild on an extensive basis suggests that one out of every 15 American grandparents may be doing the equivalent of almost a full-time job in terms of the hours devoted to this activity. It should be noted, moreover, that the denominator here includes grandparents who may be very elderly or ill, and those who are geographically at a considerable distance from their grandchildren. When we limited our analysis to those grandparents who had provided some child care in the last month (40.4% of the grandparent sample), almost 15% were providing extensive child care, as were one in five (20.2%) of those who reported providing child care while their adult child worked. The latter finding is in keeping with earlier national studies by Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich, and Holcomb 1991    and others (Brayfield, Deich, and Hofferth 1993   ), who found that 19% of preschoolers whose mothers worked in 1990 were receiving child care primarily from grandparents and other relatives, rising to 28% for low-income preschool children.Our finding that 9% of all Americans with grandchildren under age 5 were providing extensive caregiving to a grandchild is considerable higher than the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate that 5.4% of all preschoolers in 1993 were being cared for by a grandparent while the mother was in full-time employment (Casper 1996   ). The fact that the census data are restricted solely to caregiving while the grandchild's mother is working full-time is the likely cause of the discrepancy between the two figures. The 30 or more hours grandparents provide care per week may, in fact, be a combination of hours spent babysitting for different families of grandchildren, each of which had a mother who worked. Similarly, the 30 hours may include time spent babysitting while the grandchild's parents are not at work. The inclusion of 90 or more nights in our extensive caregiving category widened the scope of caregiving to include extended visits and part-time night-shift work.It should be recalled that, with the exception of custodial caregiving, the measures utilized in this study assessed only caregiving during the past year. If we were to consider the percentage of grandparents providing extensive care at some point in their lives, the estimates cited would undoubtedly be considerably higher.Finally, as noted earlier, the rates of extensive grandchild care provision revealed in our study omit two small but important groups: grandparents who were providing such care to the offspring of teenage children, and those who at some point in the 1990s were primary caregivers to one or more grandchildren. Despite recent declines, the continuing high rates of teenage childbirth in the United States resulted in almost half a million live births in 1999 (Curtin and Martin 2000   ). Earlier research, suggesting that grandparents play a particularly important caregiving role for the children of teenage parents (Burton 1990   ; Cherlin and Furstenberg 1986   ), underscores the importance of further research that includes this category. Similarly, the omission from our sample of extensive caregivers of the 67 respondents who were providing both custodial and extensive care decreased the percentage of extensive caregivers from 9% to the just under 7% reported.When we turned from prevalence to a sociodemographic profile of grandparents providing extensive care to their grandchildren, an interesting picture emerged. As suggested above, the majority of grandparents playing this role were married White women in their mid 50s who had five grandchildren and were as likely as not to have one of their own children residing with them. Most were high school graduates, and the mean 1993 income was over $34,000.Our finding that extensive caregivers were significantly younger than noncaregivers is understandable, because younger grandparents are likely to be in better health and hence physically and mentally better able to provide extensive child care than their noncaregiving counterparts. The greater prevalence of extensive caregiving among grandmothers than grandfathers similarly is in keeping with much earlier sociological research (Abel 1991   ; Hochschild 1989   ) suggesting that women do the bulk of caregiving over the life course. However, our finding that over a third (35%) of extensive caregivers were men (compared to just 23% of custodial caregivers) suggests that a sizable proportion of grandfathers do in fact provide considerable care for grandchildren on a regular basis, and underscores the need for further study of this population.Although, as noted earlier, the majority of extensive grandchild care providers in our study were White women, the fact that such grandparents were considerably more likely than noncaregivers, as well as occasional and intermediate care providers, to be African American also is in keeping with the literature (Hunter 1997   ). Such extensive care provision thus has been shown to be more normative among African Americans, for whom the role of "caregiver across the generations" has been a critical one historically. African American caregiving thus is rooted in West African culture and tradition (Sudarkasa 1981   ; Wilson 1989   ) and played a critical role in the United States during and after slavery and during the great migrations north after World War II (Wilson 1989   ).Although most grandparents reported that they were quite close to their grandchildren, the extra contact experienced by extensive caregivers was associated with significantly higher reports of closeness than was experienced by noncaregivers and those providing only occasional child care. This association may reflect the fact that greater contact allows for a closer bonding with grandchildren—a phenomenon also observed among custodial and intermediate care providers. An alternate explanation is that closer attachment to grandchildren motivates a grandparent to undertake the extensive caregiving role. Further qualitative research into the nature and nuances of such closeness, from the perspective of both grandparents and grandchildren, is needed to help enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.Extensive caregivers more closely resembled intermediate caregivers than either noncaregivers or occasional caregivers. However, extensive caregiving grandparents were from more vulnerable populations than their peers providing intermediate care: they were more likely to be poor, for example, and less likely to have completed high school. The presence of coresident children (which is also likely to increase the odds of coresident grandchildren) is a strong predictor of extensive as opposed to intermediate care provision. Such higher rates of coresidence may reflect fewer living arrangement options as a result of low income and related factors, but further research would be needed to substantiate this hypothesis.A major finding of this study was that extensive caregivers appeared to resemble custodial caregivers to a much greater degree than did those who provided only occasional child care. For example, although just 8% of occasional child care providers lived below the poverty line, the figure was far higher (18%) for extensive caregivers and highest of all (23%) for custodial parents. Since grandparents who are poor are more likely to have grandchildren who also live in low-income households, it may well be that the former's heavy involvement in child care provision reflects, in part, the prohibitive costs of much organized child care (Casper 1996   ).There were, of course, areas of significant difference between extensive and custodial caregivers. The fact that the latter were more likely to be unmarried, to be female, and to have more grandchildren, for example, is in keeping with earlier studies (Chalfie 1994   ; Fuller-Thomson et al. 1997   ; Harden, Clark, and Maguire 1997   ), which demonstrated major differences between custodial and other grandparents along these dimensions. Similarly, the fact that custodial grandparents were significantly more likely to be African American than were extensive caregivers in the bivariate analyses is in keeping with the far higher rates of custodial grandparenting among African American grandparents, one in four of whom occupies this role for at least 6 months (Szinovacz 1998   ). The earlier mentioned similarity between extensive and custodial grandparent caregivers along multiple dimensions, however, is of major consequence and may indeed reflect a blurring of the line between these two roles, as grandparents move from one to the other as need dictates. The impressive body of literature on custodial grandparents generated over the past decade (Burnette 1999   ; Burton 1992   ; Chalfie 1994   ; Emick and Hayslip 1996   ; Fuller-Thomson et al. 1997   ; Minkler and Roe 1993   ; Pruchno 1999   ; Sands and Goldberg-Glen 1998   ) needs to be supplemented by studies that explore in more detail the lives of both extensive and custodial grandparents, with particular attention to the trajectory of the caregiving experience over time.In addition, the evolving nature of the continuum of child care provision by grandparents needs to be carefully explored within the context of the changing demographic, cultural, and sociopolitical landscape of the United States. The rapid growth of a variety of both Latino and Asian Pacific Islander populations, for example, underscores the need for far greater research attention to the grandparental child care provision roles of these largely neglected groups (see Burnette 1999   , and Burnette in press    for important exceptions). Changes over time in the extent and nature of child care provision within such groups as a result of acculturation and other factors also should be explored through both qualitative and quantitative studies.Finally, sociopolitical factors, including, importantly, the implementation of welfare reform legislation, merit careful attention. A key informant study in California (Minkler, Berrick, and Needell 1999   ), for example, revealed considerable concern among policy analysts and providers that the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act's (1996) work requirements and the requirement that unmarried teenage mothers live with a parent or guardian and either attend school or hold a job as a condition of aid, could well result in an increasing number of middle-aged and older women being pressured to become extensive child care providers for their grandchildren. The fact that over half of extensive caregivers in this study had coresident children (as opposed to 29% of noncaregivers) suggests that such grandmothers may already be providing considerable family care, and additional responsibility for nonresident grandchildren may pose a substantial burden. As Mullen 2000   (p. 129) has noted, most states "have largely neglected" the impact of welfare reform on grandparents, and efforts are needed to both monitor this issue and help ensure that grandparents are supported, rather than penalized, if they indeed become extensive child care providers to grandchildren as a consequence of the changing welfare environment.Finally, as Casper and Bryson 1998   (p. 14) have argued, "grandparents and their grandchildren would benefit greatly if policies and programs intended to help traditional parent–child families in times of need could be extended to grandchildren" and the grandparents who often play a substantial role in their care.

     Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate burden experienced by a group of American Indian primary family caregivers and to determine if caregiver burden is a multidimensional concept. Design and Methods: This analysis is based on the results of a survey questionnaire administered to 169 Pueblo primary family caregivers in New Mexico. Results: Analysis of the items composing the Caregiver Burden scale indicated that caregiver burden is multidimensional and consists of several types of burden. Caregiver burden, as identified in this sample, is composed of four dimensions: role conflict, negative feelings, lack of caregiver efficacy, and guilt. Investigations of caregiver burden should consider the multidimensionality of this experience and evaluate burden accordingly. Implications:By identifying the specific type of burden that a caregiver experiences, interventions can be targeted more accurately to support family caregiving.   Family caregiving ,  American Indians ,  Caregiver burden Vernon L. Greene, PhDDespite the growth of aging programs in the United States, family support networks continue to provide most long-term care services to functionally impaired elders. In fact, it has been recognized for some time that as an elder's impairment level increases, the value of services provided by the informal support network also increases (General Accounting Office 1977   ). Subsequent research has further established the family as the primary provider of long-term care services (American Association of Retired Persons and Travelers Foundation 1988   ; National Alliance for Caregiving and American Association of Retired Persons 1997   ; Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl 1987   ; Wood and Wan 1993   ). Whether or not one endorses the notion that minority families provide more support to their elders than non-Hispanic White families, there is a general consensus that minority families are changing in ways that reduce the ability of the family to provide long-term care services (Antonucci and Cantor 1991   ; Burton and Dilworth-Anderson 1991   ; John 1999   ).Moreover, as evidenced by lower institutionalization rates (Himes, Hogan, and Eggebeen 1996   ; John 1995   ) and lower proportions of minority elders living alone (Angel and Hogan 1991   ), minority families are even more salient as the providers of long-term care services than among non-Hispanic White elders. Because families are the principal providers of long-term care services to minority elders, it is vital to understand the context of family caregiving, especially the problems that threaten the caregiving system. Clearly, the persons who actually provide most of the care to impaired elders are the essential element in the family caregiving system, and whatever compromises their ability to provide care places the system in jeopardy. This fundamental insight has resulted in the development of one of the most active areas of gerontological research for nearly two decades.Despite the inordinate amount of attention given to family caregiving issues during this time, knowledge of caregiving issues among American Indians—whose population age 65 and older increased 52% between 1980 and 1990 (Barresi and Stull 1993   )—is far less developed than similar research on other groups. In fact, only a handful of studies have investigated any caregiving issues in this population. Moreover, little is known about how the problems and stresses of caregiving are handled in light of American Indian cultural norms and expectations for elder care. Although the extended family structure and traditional values of American Indian tribes support and prescribe elder care (Red Horse 1980   ), family caregivers—particularly those in reservation settings—can and do experience various difficulties associated with caregiving. American Indian Caregiving Research To date, most of the published research on American Indian family caregiving has been based on qualitative investigations. In a single, small-scale qualitative study that compared the perceptions of caregiving burden and coping among 10 Northwest Indian and 10 White caregivers matched on sex, income, and rural residence, Strong 1984    suggested that the experience of caretaking responsibilities and stresses differed between the two groups. In comparison to White caregivers, Strong found that the responses of the Indian caregivers suggested that they perceived themselves as having less control over the caregiving situation and that they also placed more emphasis on the positive dimensions of managing the needs of a dependent elder. Indian caregivers used a coping strategy that Strong characterized as "passive forbearance," that is, emphasizing acceptance of and adaptation to the caregiving situation rather than attempting to actively control it.A second research project conducted on caregiving in American Indian families (Hobus 1990   ) is a sin-gle case study that described the intermediary role played by a nurse in helping a family prepare to provide care to a frail Lakota elder during her periodic home visits away from an off-reservation Anglo nursing home. Hobus identified seven major problems that emerged during the family assessment process, including knowledge deficits in how to provide care to the elder, lack of knowledge about how to obtain outside help, lack of familiarity with the consumer rights of nursing home patients, guilt related to not providing care to the elder at home, fear about the eventual death of the elder in an alien surrounding, resentment toward previous health care providers, and concern for the health of the primary family caregiver during the elder's home visits. Because the family had provided in-home care to the elder before her placement in the nursing home, some of these problems were based on the experience of full-time, in-home caregiving, although these issues were not the explicit focus of Hobus's research.A broader qualitative study of the situation and experiences of family caregivers among five tribes (Hennessy and John 1995   , Hennessy and John 1996   ; Hennessy, John, and Anderson 1999   ) identified a number of sources of burden among these caregivers. These Indian caregivers reported commonly experienced stresses such as competing responsibilities between caregiving and work or other family duties and perceived negative effects on family relationships and on personal health and well-being. These burdens were often produced or exacerbated by conditions encountered on these reservations, such as lack of indoor plumbing, the need to chop and haul wood for cooking and heating, or lack of availability of or access to comprehensive services.To some degree, the caregivers in this study (Hennessy and John 1995   , Hennessy and John 1996   ; Hennessy, John, and Anderson 1999   ) interpreted these burdens in a culturally distinct manner. For example, some family helpers viewed burden as being associated with those difficulties that negatively affected their ability to carry out their culturally endorsed role as care providers. Moreover, in contrast to findings reported for non-Hispanic White caregivers (e.g., Steinmetz 1988   ), these American Indian caregivers emphasized the effects of caregiving strain on the group (i.e., family and tribe) rather than those that infringed on a caregiver's personal or individual needs (such as privacy or time for self).In contrast to Strong 1984    findings, Hennessy and John 1995    found that family caregivers were active in their attempt to enlist the support of others within both informal and formal support networks to create an effective caregiving routine (i.e., gaining mastery of the situation) and to seek information on potential resources to assist them with caregiving responsibilities. They found that caregivers in these five tribes accepted the caregiving situation, but not passively. Indeed, these caregivers also expressed some degree of resentment toward service providers and noncontributing family members for the lack of assistance with elder care. Overall, a salient finding was the pervasive sense of cultural obligation for caregiving that was expressed by these primary family caregivers. Hennessy and John 1996    concluded that this cultural norm underlies caregiving activities for this group of American Indians, with important policy and programming implications for the design and delivery of long-term care services.These qualitative findings suggest that American Indian caregivers endorse certain burden concepts differently than their non-Hispanic White or other non-Indian counterparts. According to Biegel, Sales, and Schulz 1991   (p. 51), because "the concept of burden lies at the heart of caregiving, it is essential that we achieve some clarity on the notion of burden at both the conceptual and measurement levels." Caregiver Burden Research Despite the fact that a widespread consensus has developed that the concept of caregiver burden is a central issue in any theoretical conceptualization of the caregiving process, a limited amount of previous research has investigated the multidimensionality of the concept of caregiver burden (Braithwaite 1996   ; Greene, Smith, Gardiner, and Timbury 1982   ; Lawton, Kleban, Moss, Rovine, and Glicksman 1989   ; Miller, McFall, and Montgomery 1991   ; Montgomery, Gonyea, and Hooyman 1985   ; Montgomery, Stull, and Borgatta 1985   ; Zarit 1992   ; Zarit and Zarit 1990   ). Although researchers differ in the label they attach to this phenomenon (i.e., burden, strain, stress, or appraisal), everyone recognizes it as an important influence on caregiving outcomes, and it is important that the complexity of this concept be better understood. Without engaging in the dispute about which of these terms or labels best represents the phenomenon, we wish to determine if burden (the negative subjective appraisal of the caregiving situation) is multidimensional among American Indian caregivers and identify the types of burden American Indian caregivers experience.As several researchers (Hernandez 1991   ; Luborsky and Sankar 1993   ; MaloneBeach and Zarit 1991   ) have recognized, caregiving has different meanings and implications for different groups—including ethnic groups—and the lack of attention to group differences may obscure important findings about the experience of caregiving. In contrast to those who seek some universally valid conceptualization of what constitutes caregiver burden, Lawton and associates 1989    made the valid point that "some cross-sample variation in structure is probably the norm" (p. P70). Indeed, Lawton and colleagues ended their article by calling for additional measurement development and further examination of the generalizability of findings "across different subgroups of caregivers" (p. P71). To date, few studies have investigated the multidimensionality of caregiver burden, and no quantitative studies have investigated burden among American Indian caregivers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate caregiver burden among a sample of American Indian primary family caregivers and to identify important dimensions or types of perceived burden for this group. Methods This study was based on the results of a face-to-face survey of 169 Pueblo primary family caregivers. The data on the situation of American Indian primary family caregivers were collected between 1995 and 1997 as part of a National Institute on Aging–funded project (R01-AG11294; Robert John, principal investigator) in collaboration with American Indian aging programs in New Mexico. The broad purpose of the study was to investigate the family caregiving situation, including the identity of the caregiver, the tasks performed, the level and types of elder impairment, and a range of additional caregiving issues. A central concern of the research was to evaluate the level of perceived burden and identify the types of burden experienced by Pueblo caregivers. We hypothesized that, if the many critics of global measures of caregiver burden are correct (George 1994   ; George and Gwyther 1986   ; McKinlay, Crawford, and Tennstedt 1995   ; Poulshock and Deimling 1984   ; Schultz 1990   ; Stull, Kosloski, and Kercher 1994   ; Vitaliano, Young, and Russo 1991   ), then caregiver burden should be multidimensional and the structure of caregiver burden should suggest how American Indian cultural values influence negative caregiving appraisals (Russo, Vitaliano, and Young 1991   ). The Burden Interview The Caregiver Burden scale used in this study was based on an instrument adapted from the Burden Interview (BI) developed by Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson 1980   . The BI measures the extent to which caregivers perceive their emotional or physical health, social life, and financial status to be negatively affected as a result of their caregiving role and duties.The BI was selected for use because of its comparatively concrete phrasing and because of the greater face validity of items for this population than other candidate scales (Hennessy and John 1995   ). All 22 items in this scale were measured at the ordinal level and were of the Likert scale format. Most of the adaptations made to the scale involved changing each question to elicit a temporal characterization of the experience by prefacing each question with the phrase "how often do you." Response categories to each item were never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, and nearly always. The other systematic change was to substitute elder for your relative so the interviewer could mention each care recipient by name or relationship (i.e., your mother).Other than these format changes that did not change the original substantive issue of each question, three questions were modified to make them more appropriate to a broader population of caregivers. The original BI question that asked caregivers if they were stressed between caring for their relative and meeting other responsibilities to family or work was changed to pulled between these responsibilities. The question that asked whether caregivers feel like they have lost control of their lives "since your relative's illness" was changed to "since you've become a caregiver." The final change involved a wording change to the global measure of caregiver burden. In the original BI, this question was the only one that had a different response set (not at all, a little, moderately, quite a bit, extremely). We transformed the question to retain its meaning but elicit a response similar to the other items. Our wording, "Overall, how often do you feel burdened in caring for [elder]," made this question consistent with the other items in the scale. The exact wording of each question can be found in  Table 1  . Additional Measures The survey instrument assessed ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs; five items) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; eight items). Each item was measured on a 3-point scale (no help needed, some help needed, cannot perform the activity). The ADL and IADL scales were derived from Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffee 1963    and Lawton and Brody 1969   , respectively, and had been used in the Michigan Caregiver Study (see Kosloski, Young, and Montgomery 1999   , for a description of the measures). One IADL item was changed from "buying/getting food/clothes" to "shopping for food or other essentials." To better reflect the caregiving context, another important IADL was added: dealing with government agencies and other organizations (e.g., filling out forms, arranging for services). The Cognitive Status scale (seven items) was based on a scale developed by Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, and Skaff 1990   . On the basis of discussions with Pueblo service providers, we modified the response set to measure each item on a 3-point scale (never a problem, occasionally a problem, always a problem). To make the scale more appropriate for Pueblo caregivers, we dropped one item (remembers home address) and modified one item from remembering "the day of the week" to remembering "what season it is." Both of these modifications made the item more appropriate to the Pueblo living environment (no house numbers or street addresses) and a temporal orientation more in tune with nature. The Sample The sample of individuals who participated in this study was composed of 169 primary caregivers who cared for functionally impaired family members. Selection criteria were based on care recipient characteristics, including being 55 years of age or older and requiring help with at least one physical ADL, or with at least two IADLs. In addition to the threshold of care, the Title VI program directors were instructed to interview the person who provided the most care to the elder.Participants were recruited by staff from local American Indian senior service (Title VI) programs who were familiar with families caring for an impaired relative in their community. Although our sample was purposely selected, our goal was to survey the universe of primary family caregivers who were dealing with situations that met the selection criteria. Because of the nature of relatively small American Indian communities (including tribal bureaucratic procedures such as the maintenance of a tribal roll, annual documentation of the size of the elderly service population for purposes of federal funding, and the deep nexus of family interconnections of historical proportion), the situation of each elder in the community is known, especially to service providers charged with their care. Because of this and our attempt to identify and interview all caregivers who met the selection criteria, we are confident in the representativeness of the sample.The primary caregiver was interviewed in person by an indigenous service provider who was trained by us in administration of the instrument. Interviews took place in the caregiver's home or another mutually acceptable location where respondent privacy could be assured. The interviewer read each of the survey questions to the respondent because this more conversational mode of conducting the survey is more culturally appropriate than self-administration by the respondent and because, among elderly caregivers in particular, literacy in English might be limited. Caregiver Characteristics The sample of primary family caregivers was 86% female. The most frequently represented caregiver was a daughter (54%), followed by a wife (11%), son (6%), granddaughter (5%), husband (4%), sister (4%), and daughter-in-law (2%). The remaining caregivers (15%) were other family members (grandson, niece, nephew, or son-in-law) or others (friend, live-in partner).The caregivers ranged in age from 16 to 90 years with a median age of 49 years. Most of the caregivers in the sample were married (47%), followed by a significant portion who had never married (36%); 13% were widowed, and 4% were divorced or separated. Approximately three quarters (74%) of the caregivers were living with the care recipient, and a solid majority of caregivers (57%) had responsibilities for the care of one or more dependent children within their household. Care Recipient Characteristics The median age of the care recipients was 81 years (ranging from 55 to 103 years old), and 66% were female. Half of the caregivers (50%) said that the elder was very dependent on others for help with daily tasks, and another 34% said that the elder was somewhat dependent. The remainder of the elders were not very dependent (8%) or not dependent at all (9%).Caregiver reports of the elder's functional and cognitive impairments and problem behaviors revealed that the typical care recipient was highly impaired. On the basis of the caregiver's assessment, most elders had substantial problems with IADLs such as using the telephone, using transportation, preparing meals, taking medicine, doing housework, managing money, or dealing with government agencies. Approximately two thirds of the care recipients needed some assistance with all of these activities. Although fewer elders had difficulties with physical ADLs (including bathing, using the toilet, dressing, transferring from bed and chairs, or eating), fully one quarter (25%) of these care recipients needed some assistance with all five ADL tasks.Caregivers claimed that cognitive impairment or difficult behaviors were also a problem. When asked how frequently the elder exhibited seven specific cognitive deficits (remember recent events, the season, words, understand simple instructions, find way around the house, speak sentences, or recognize people), more than one quarter (28%) of these care recipients displayed five or more of these problems at least occasionally. To make matters worse, approximately 9 in 10 (92%) of the care recipients had exhibited one or more of the following problem behaviors during the past month: wandering or getting lost, being constantly restless, being nervous or agitated, engaging in potentially dangerous activities, or being incontinent. In fact, incontinence was a problem either occasionally (40%) or frequently (13%) for more than half of the care recipients. Because of these high levels of impairment, close to one half (48%) of the caregivers reported that the care recipient could not be left alone for more than an hour. Factor Analytic Techniques To examine the underlying dimensions of caregiver burden among this American Indian sample, we analyzed the data using exploratory factor analysis. Exploratory factor analysis is a construct validation method "aimed at assessing the validity of treating a set of indicators as reflecting the same construct" (Pedhazur and Schmelkin 1991   , p. 65). In other words, this method analyzes how responses to questions group together to provide some meaning about the relationships between them. We used principal-axis factoring, the most widely used method of factor extraction (Pedhazur and Schmelkin 1991   ). This method of extraction was chosen for its utility in analyzing individual items for construct validity. Other techniques used in the factor analysis were listwise deletion of missing values and oblique rotation of the factor solution. The criterion for acceptance of factors was set at a minimum eigenvalue of 1.0. Items with a communality and a factor loading of 0.40 or more were retained. Reliability of the factors, or subscales, was evaluated by using Cronbach's alpha. Findings Overall, the data indicate that Pueblo caregivers reported substantial levels of perceived burden.  Table 1  indicates the percentage of respondents who said they quite frequently or nearly always felt a particular type of burden. Results of a reliability analysis of the entire caregiver burden scale yielded an alpha of .91, a finding consistent with results reported by others (Gallagher et al. 1985   ; Zarit and Zarit 1990   ). Exploratory Factor Analysis  Table 2  presents the zero-order correlations, means, and standard deviations for the items retained in the factor analysis. In general, the zero-order correlations were consistently high among items contained within the same factor and lower among items that were found to load in different factors. The means and standard deviations were reasonable given the caregiving context and content of the items. Although not included in  Table 2  , the skew and kurtosis values showed that the items were normally distributed.Factor analysis indicated that caregiver burden among Pueblo primary family caregivers is multidimensional and consists of several components or types of burden. Results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated four factors or latent variables that were composed of items that were highly correlated with each other but were not highly correlated with other factors, supporting the multidimensionality of caregiver burden among this group of American Indians. Evidence of the construct validity and reliability of the subscales was provided by the high factor loadings, communalities, and by the Cronbach's alpha coefficients.  Table 3  identifies each subscale and its constituent burden items.Factor 1 was composed of eight scale items: How often do you feel (a) that because of the time you spend with [elder] that you do not have enough time for yourself, (b) that [elder] is dependent on you, (c) pulled between caring for [elder] and trying to meet other responsibilities for your family or work, (d) that [elder] seems to expect you to take care of him/her as if you were the only one he/she could depend on, (e) that you do not have as much privacy as you would like because you are caring for [elder], (f) strained when you are around [elder], (g) your health has suffered because of your involvement with [elder], and (h) that your social life has suffered because you are caring for [elder]? These items measure the degree to which caregiving interferes with other roles or interpersonal relationships or stems from divergent role expectations, and the factor was, therefore, identified as Role Conflict. The construct validity of this factor was supported by the communalities ranging from .409 to .719 and the factor loadings ranging from .45 to .77. The alpha coefficient (.88) indicates the high degree of reliability of this subscale.Factor 2 was composed of four items: How often do you feel (a) angry when you are around [elder], (b) embarrassed over [elder]'s behavior, (c) uncomfortable about having friends over because of [elder], and (d) that [elder] currently affects your relationship with other family members or friends in a negative way? These items measured the degree of negative feelings about the caregiving situation that caregivers acknowledged. Negative feelings toward the elder and perceived disruption of interpersonal relationships brought about by the caregiving situation were evident in this subscale. The results for this factor showed that the communalities ranged from .545 to .685, and the factor loadings ranged from .47 to .84. The reliability of this subscale was assessed (α = .83), indicating a high degree of internal consistency.The third factor was composed of four items: How often do you feel (a) that you will be unable to take care of [elder] much longer, (b) wish you could just leave the care of [elder] to someone else, (c) feel uncertain about what to do about [the elder], and (d) feel you have lost control of your life since you've become a caregiver? The communalities for this factor ranged from .441 to .633, and the factor loadings ranged from .61 to .77. The alpha coefficient of .82 indicated the high degree of reliability of this subscale. We labeled this type of burden Caregiver Efficacy because it reflects an assessment of the caregiver's capability to provide care to the elder. It indicates the degree to which the caregiver is experiencing serious questions about whether or for how long they will be able to care for the elder. A high score on this type of burden suggests that the caregiving situation is at a critical point that may place the elder at risk of not receiving care adequate to meet his or her needs. This type of burden may well be the precursor of neglect, institutionalization, or a shift of caregiving to others.Factor 4 was composed of two items: How often do you feel (a) you should be doing more for [elder] and (b) you could do a better job in caring for [elder]? The communalities for this factor were .761 and .554, and the factor loadings were .87 and .75. The reliability of this index was satisfactory (α = .79). These items measured the perceived degree of guilt indicated by the caregivers about the caregiving situation. Higher scores on this index indicated feelings of inadequacy by the caregivers concerning the extent and effectiveness of their caregiving activities.As seen in  Table 4  , the first three types of burden were moderately related to each other, which was consistent with the only other study to report such findings (Novak and Guest 1989   ). However, the fourth factor—guilt—was not related to any of the other types of burden.Four burden interview items were excluded from the factor solution: How often do you feel (a) that [elder] asks for more help than he/she needs, (b) afraid of what the future holds for [elder], (c) that you don't have enough money to care for [elder] in addition to the rest of your expenses, and (d) overall, how often do you feel burdened in caring for [elder]? Discussion We tested the 22 items composing the Caregiver Burden scale on a sample of 169 American Indian primary family caregivers. Analysis indicated that caregiver burden is multidimensional and consists of several types of burden. We believe, therefore, that investigations into the level of perceived caregiver burden among American Indians should consider the multidimensionality of this experience and evaluate burden accordingly.Perceived caregiver burden is composed of four dimensions, or types, of burden and four separate unscaled items: (a) role conflict, (b) negative feelings, (c) caregiver efficacy, and (d) guilt and the unscaled items of feeling that elder asks for more help than he/she needs, afraid of what the future holds for the elder, that they do not have enough money to care for the elder in addition to the rest of their expenses, and overall feeling burdened in caring for the elder. Role Conflict The type of burden we labeled role conflict is classic caregiver burden (containing elements that most, if not all, caregivers experience). It signifies the multiple impacts of caregiving on the life of the caregiver from personal impacts (time for self, lack of privacy, health has suffered) and disruption of other roles (pulled between elder and other responsibilities, social life has suffered) to features of the changing relationship with the care recipient (elder dependent, only one elder can depend on, strained around elder). Negative Feelings The second factor represents the caregiver's negative feelings toward the care recipient. This factor closely resembles one of three factors reported by Greene and colleagues 1982    and one of five factors identified by Novak and Guest 1989   . Although Greene and colleagues used a different instrument on a small sample (N = 38) among caregivers of demented elders, three of the four items they identified (feel embarrassed, prevented from having visitors, gets cross and angry) are quite similar to three of the items in our factor. Novak and Guest also used a different instrument on a sample of 107 caregivers of cognitively impaired elders, half of whom resided in an institution. They also found a five-item factor that contained three variables (feel embarrassed, uncomfortable having friends over, angry about interactions with care receiver) that are similar to ones identified in our analysis. Novak and Guest labeled this factor Emotional Burden but described it as negative feelings that they attributed to behavioral problems that often accompany cognitive impairment.Our findings suggest that negative feelings are a type of burden American Indian caregivers also experience. Although our previous research (Hennessy and John 1995   ) found some degree of denial about negative feelings and emotions during focus group discussions, at the time we speculated that a group discussion may not be conducive to an admission of negative sentiments because it would be a public acknowledgement of a norm violation. There can be little doubt that feeling anger, embarrassment, social discomfort, and social limitations are inconsistent with how Indian caregivers are supposed to feel about caregiving. Yet this constellation of negative feelings was present among these caregivers when they did not have to admit publicly that they had such feelings. Caregiver Efficacy We labeled the third factor Caregiver Efficacy because the items in this factor cast doubt on the ability to sustain caregiving. Unfortunately, the items that compose this factor are quite ominous and even suggest a certain amount of desperation. Feeling unable to care much longer, wishing they could just leave care to someone else, feeling that they have lost control of their life and are uncertain about what to do all suggest caregiver breakdown. Guilt The fourth factor (could do a better job and should be doing more) represents caregiver guilt. The distribution of responses to these two items suggests that guilt is the most common form of caregiver burden among Pueblo caregivers. Most of the responses to both of these items were consistent. For example, around one fifth (22%) never or rarely felt guilty, approximately one third (36%) experienced both feelings sometimes, and 22% experienced one or both feeling more frequently. The remaining caregivers (19%) were somewhat inconsistent about whether they could or should do more.From a cultural perspective, guilt is extremely important because it is independent of the other factors, having little to do with role conflict, negative feelings, or caregiver efficacy (see  Table 3  and  Table 4  ). The existence of this factor confirms one of the major problems identified by Hobus 1990    in her study of an Indian family that had placed an elder in a non-Indian nursing home. Given American Indian cultural values, their guilt is understandable. However, our findings suggest that guilt is a form of caregiver burden that exists even when performing a culturally prescribed role.The findings of this study suggest that Pueblo Indian family caregivers experience guilt more intensely than the other three types of burden. This being the case, service providers should initially determine whether guilt is warranted. If the elder is not being cared for adequately, then additional caregiving support services should be procured for the family. If the elder is being adequately cared for, but the guilt feelings of the caregiver are based on faulty perceptions, then services should be tailored to provide education and affirmation to the caregiver. This might be delivered in the form of counseling sessions with a medical social worker or other health-related professional or in a group setting such as a caregiver support group. Other Burden Issues It is interesting to speculate about possible substantive reasons that four items did not scale well. The first item, feeling that elder asks for more help than he/she needs, was endorsed by approximately one quarter of the caregivers. We believe that there are several possible reasons that this appraisal was not systematically related to any of the factors. Because of the high level of impairment and dependence that was recognized by these caregivers, it is possible that the caregivers do not consider most requests for assistance made by the care recipient as unreasonable. Alternately, it could be that most care recipients are not very demanding regardless of the type or level of need for assistance, a behavioral characteristic that is quite consistent with American Indian cultural norms. Either of these occurrences would constrain the relationship between unreasonable demands for assistance and a sense of role conflict, negative feelings, lack of efficacy, or guilt.The second item, feeling afraid of the elder's future, is a feeling that was endorsed by a substantial proportion of the caregivers (39%). This assessment is not unreasonable in any caregiving circumstance because a decline in the elder's condition is expected at some point in the future regardless of the elder's current condition. Moreover, as seen in the description of the sample, the typical elderly care recipient was highly impaired and dependent on the caregiver. Our previous research with Pueblo family caregivers likewise confirmed the anxiety that these caregivers frequently experienced given the perceived lack of adequate information about the nature and expected course of the elder's medical condition and/or psychological problems (Hennessy and John 1995   , Hennessy and John 1996   ; Hennessy, John, and Anderson 1999   ).However, the third item—not having enough money—needs to be interpreted more squarely within the Pueblo cultural framework. Our previous work (Hennessy and John 1995   ) documented a number of Pueblo cultural norms that influence the interpretation or meaning assigned to the caregiving situation. Primary caregivers in these focus group discussions tended to endorse family caregiving at all costs (personal as well as financial) and were less likely to view financial problems associated with caregiving as an important determinant of their caregiving behaviors. Moreover, from a socioeconomic perspective, many of these families lack financial resources and experience financial difficulties on a continuing basis, so that the financial difficulties associated with caregiving are not as salient as among Anglo families. Among many Pueblo families, the financial difficulties associated with caring for an elder are simply part of a broader mix of financial pressures and concerns. In addition, one aspect of the cultural ethos regarding older tribal members expressed in the focus groups (Hennessy and John 1995   ) may have relevance to the lack of emphasis on the monetary costs of elder care. This is the view of elders as repositories of cultural knowledge, wisdom, and language, on whom a monetary value cannot be placed. From this vantage point, caregiving was seen as part of the larger fabric of nurturance and preservation of Pueblo culture, and the death of an elder was regarded as an inestimable loss to the Pueblo cultural legacy.Several other features of the caregiving context may also influence the independence of financial concerns from the identified types of burden. First, American Indians in this study have access to a socialized medical system through care provided by the Indian Health Service. The Indian Health Service provides acute inpatient and ambulatory patient care through hospitals and clinics and delivers or funds modest community-based health care services. Although the services provided by the Indian Health Service do not have a geriatric focus and existing programs are underfunded, the services that are available do not require out-of-pocket expenses. Therefore, one source of financial concern (mounting medical expenses) does not exist for these caregivers.Second, the Indian Health Service does not fund institutional long-term care, and only one tribe in New Mexico operates a nursing home. Therefore, the kind of financial concern associated with nursing home placement probably does not influence caregiver perceptions of burden. Typically, nursing home placement would mean placement in a non-Indian nursing home. For most families, the financial cost of such care would be prohibitive, but the cultural cost (removing the elder from Pueblo culture and violating a cultural norm to provide care within the family) would be the salient consideration.The final item that was not retained in the factor analysis was the measure of the overall feeling of burden. As a global indication of caregiver burden, it is good that this item did not uniquely load on any single factor. In fact, this item was the most complex of the variables and was associated with the first three factors to a modest degree. Guilt was the only type of burden to which this sense of overall burden was not related. Comparison With Previous Research Our findings differ substantially from previous investigations of the multidimensionality of caregiver burden in two important respects: (a) in the factor structure of the individual items that compose each type of burden and (b) the latent concept revealed by the factor analytic technique. Perhaps this is to be expected, as most of these studies used, at best, only a few items that were the same or similar to those in this study. However, our results are quite different from the limited results reported by Zarit and Zarit 1990   . They identified two factors that they labeled Role Strain and Personal Strain, along with the burden items of each factor. In contrast to their findings, our results suggest a more complicated factor structure. Because so little has been published about the dimensions of caregiver burden, it is difficult to speculate about the reasons for these differences. One possibility is simply that their results were based on a different group whose characteristics were not reported but probably did not contain any American Indian respondents. Another possibility is that the factor structure is more complex than what was reported by Zarit and Zarit 1990   , as other studies that have investigated the factor structure of caregiver burden have generally reported more than two factors to represent the factor structure (Braithwaite 1996   ; Greene et al. 1982   ; Kosberg, Cairl, and Keller 1990   ; Lawton et al. 1989   ; Niederehe and Fruge 1984   ; Novak and Guest 1989   ; cf. Miller, McFall, and Montgomery 1991   ; Poulshock and Deimling 1984   ). Practical Implications The identification of a more complex conceptualization of burden has a number of practical benefits. In the first instance, by identifying the specific type of burden that a caregiver predominantly experiences, interventions can be targeted more accurately. For example, if a caregiver mainly experiences the type of burden we have labeled negative feelings, then a support group or individual counseling might be a more appropriate intervention than, say, respite services. Such targeted interventions open a new avenue for applied research that could provide aging service providers with a more sophisticated approach to diagnosing need and providing services to family caregivers and care recipients.The secondary benefit of having a more precise conceptualization of burden is that it would allow researchers and service providers to examine how the sense of burden changes and whether or how caregivers change in response to the experience of burden. Additional studies are also needed to identify whether certain types of burden are more common during particular stages of the caregiving experience or whether a specific type of burden is associated with particular caregiving situations (i.e., dementia care). With this kind of information, some types of burden may be anticipated (and considered normative), and other types of burden may represent a pathological state that endangers the caregiver or care recipient. Conclusion Although the findings reported here are limited to this sample of Pueblo caregivers, this study suggests the importance of continued research in the area of caregiver burden. Ideally, additional research would investigate the multidimensionality of caregiver burden among other ethnic groups, as well as other groups of American Indians. There is every reason to believe that the factor structure of burden will vary between groups based on differences in cultural values and the existence of resources (including financial resources and help received from formal service providers). Ultimately, by identifying the types of burden a particular caregiver experiences or perceives, service providers may provide support better targeted to the specific needs of the burgeoning caregiving population. Although better methods of targeting support services should save money by reducing receipt of unnecessary or unwanted services, the true value of this approach will be realized by strengthening caregiving within families. More important, this method of tailoring service support to the areas of greatest perceived burden would potentially reduce perceived burden and thereby improve the overall caregiving situation in the family and forestall neglect, family turmoil, or a variety of adverse outcomes for the impaired elder.

     Abstract This article is a brief empirical attempt to identify rural areas in the Southeast United States that have consistently attracted older migrants since 1950 and to ascertain the social, demographic, and geographic characteristics of these areas of destination that differentiate them from otherwise (initially) similar areas. These counties are followed over the successive censuses from 1950 through 1990, identifying those that have consistently experienced elderly in-migration at a rate substantially greater than the overall level. These retirement counties are concentrated in Florida, on the fringes of or adjacent to metropolitan areas or in mountain and coastal locations. The article presents regression analysis of geographic, demographic, and economic/structural correlates of migration. This analysis suggests that retirees are attracted to coastal locations whose existing populations have consistently achieved some measure of prosperity and are not dissimilar from the retirees themselves.   Demography ,  Statistical estimation ,  Rural areas Vernon L. Greene, PhDIn recent years, there has been increased interest in the role that retirees can play in the economic development of localities. Studies of particular localities (Bennett 1993   ; Carlson, Junk, Fox, Rudzitis, and Cann 1998   ; Day and Barlett 2000   ; Hodge 1991   ; Serow and Haas 1992   ; Stallmann, Deller, and Shields 1999   ) have tended to confirm the general expectation (Deller 1995   ; Fagan and Longino 1993   ; Glasgow 1990   ) that such movement can provide an infusion of external funds into a locality's existing economic base. Via the multiplier mechanism, retirees should constitute an important stimulus to employment and income growth in the locality of destination. It is hardly surprising, then, that many localities have embarked on attracting retirees as a nonpolluting source of sustained economic growth. After all, mobile retirees are usually comparatively affluent individuals who will spend at the local level, but who will require comparatively little in the way of local-level publicly provided services.Although there is extensive literature on the determinants and consequences of elderly migration (Longino 1995   , provides a book-length summary), there has been surprisingly little attention paid to longer term issues associated with the phenomenon. None of the extant empirical literature on the topic of retirement migration as a local economic development tool considers the long-term implications of the strategy, particularly those implications in the absence of the final support-seeking move suggested by Litwak and Longino 1987   .If recruiting retirees is to become a viable development strategy for rural areas, it is necessary to understand both the local-level characteristics that make an area attractive as well as the long-term consequences of such a development course. To accomplish this, it is necessary to determine which localities have been successful in attracting retirees over an extended period of time. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has identified a set of retirement counties, their typology dates only to the 1970s and removes counties from this designation if they subsequently are classified as metropolitan (Bender et al. 1985   ; Cook and Mizer 1994   ). The number of USDA-identified retirement counties declined from 515 in the 1970s to only 190 in the 1980s (Reeder 1998   ). Therefore, this article is a brief empirical attempt to identify rural areas that have consistently attracted older migrants and to ascertain the social, demographic, and geographic characteristics of the areas of destination that differentiate them from otherwise (initially) similar areas.Although considerable literature exists on the determinants of destination for older migrants (Serow, Friedrich, and Haas 1996   ), very few studies analyze such determinants for more than a single point in time (typically the 5-year migration interval available from decennial census data). The research reported here covers all intercensal periods subsequent to World War II. Furthermore, two distinct models of analysis have emerged in the existing literature. In some studies, the unit of analysis is the state (in the U.S. context), where aggregate, place-level data are employed to measure the comparative attractiveness of states of destination (Newbold 1996   ). Other studies focus on a more locally defined area where individual-level survey data are employed to measure why the particular area was in fact chosen by newly arrived residents (Carlson et al. 1998   ; Haas and Serow 1993   ). This article follows the first model, but the focus is on comparative attractiveness of counties, rather than larger geographic entities. This emphasis is unique for this type of study. However, aggregate data do not promote the study of the impact of proximity to family and friends, an influence often found to be of great importance in location decisions (Gober and Zonn 1983   ; Silverstein 1995   ).The ultimate intention of this research, beyond the scope of this article, is to identify the degree to which economic change (in the form of income and employment change) is associated with the varying models of elderly migration. One would expect that a policy of encouraging retirement migration would have positive income and employment effects for all elements of the locality's population, not just for those of retirement age. By ascertaining the empirical association between migration as a source of population aging and overall economic well-being among the selected localities, it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of retirement migration as a development strategy. Methods The study began with the universe of all counties located in the southeastern United States (defined here as the South Atlantic and East South Central census divisions), at least half of whose population was counted as rural in the 1950 census. Rural persons are those who live neither in places of 2,500 or more inhabitants nor in the densely settled fringe areas of cities. The southeast was chosen because this region had been the locus for much of the actual postwar retirement migration in the United States as well as the site for most of the extant empirical work on the topic. The year 1950 was chosen because it is the first census enumeration after the conclusion of World War II, an event that exposed many Americans to a part of the country outside their native region and may therefore have served as a first introduction to subsequent retirement relocation possibilities. The importance of some initial awareness of possible retirement destinations was emphasized by Haas and Serow 1993   . I chose an initial 50% of population as rural to eliminate from further analysis those localities that were already urban in character at the beginning of the period. Both the theoretical and empirical literature on the topic recognize the importance of a rural, or at least nonurban, environment if retirement migration is chosen as the development strategy (Haas and Serow 1997   ). However, because I chose to consider only predominately rural counties, a significant portion of retirement migration (often directed to relatively small urban areas) was excluded from the analysis.These counties were followed over the successive censuses from 1950 through 1990, identifying those that had experienced net in-migration among persons aged 60 and older at a rate greater than that of all counties in the initial universe. This was done for each intercensal period (1950–1960, 1960–1970, and so on) to ascertain which counties had consistently experienced elderly in-migration at a rate substantially greater than the overall level. Effectively, all rural southeastern counties were sorted according to their dispersion around the mean rate of retirement inmigration. A total of 837 counties (or combinations of counties and cities) met the previously stated criterion regarding share of population classified as rural in the 1950 census. (County definitions in the Commonwealth of Virginia are unique among all states in that cities are, by definition, legally separate entities from surrounding counties. To deal with this issue I combined Virginia's cities with their respective county(ies) and treated this combination as the unit for which initial determination of the criterion was made as well as for subsequent analysis.)I also decided to concentrate analysis of migration behavior solely on the White population because the ultimate focus was amenity-oriented retirement migration. Perhaps because Blacks accounted for less than 5% of interstate older movers between 1975 and 1980, there has been very little study of retirement migration behavior among Blacks (Longino and Smith 1991   , is the sole exception). Also, there is as yet no evidence to support the notion of any sizable amenity-oriented retirement migration among Blacks. With the exception of a few pockets of Native American populations in North Carolina, there were very few older "other race" (non-White, non-Black) persons residing in the rural Southeast in 1950.From successive decennial censuses of population, I computed age- and race-specific proportions of population surviving from beginning to end of the decade; this was done for the entire population of the continental United States. For example, the survival ratio was computed as Whites aged 60 to 64 years in 1960 divided by Whites aged 50 to 54 years in 1950 and similarly for older ages and subsequent years. These national survival rates were applied to the initial (i.e., 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980) White populations of each county in the study universe for ages 50–54 and in 5 year increments to 70–74, with the open-ended category of 75+. This procedure implicitly assumed no significant variation across counties in the sex ratio (males per 100 females) by age or in the extent of international migration among older Whites. The former assumption probably would have been violated only in those counties with large proportions of their elderly residing in nursing homes; there are few older Whites among immigrant streams to the United States, so the latter assumption was essentially trivial. This process produced what is termed the expected end of decade (1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990) White population of each county aged 60–64, 65–69, …, 85+. The expected populations, by age, were compared with the census enumerations, by age, for the appropriate year. This residual net migration method decomposed the growth of the older population into two components: that due to aging in place and that due to net migration. (In addition to migration, differences also arose from violation of the above assumptions as well as from census enumeration and reporting errors; there was no way of ascertaining the degree of such errors at the county level, but there was also no reason to suspect systematic bias.) Similar estimates have previously been carried out for earlier periods (Bowles, Beale, and Lee 1975   ; Bowles and Tarver 1965   ) using a slightly different methodology; for purposes of comparability over time, I used only the estimates produced by the technique described above. For initial purposes, these estimates of net migration were accumulated across all (end-of-decade) age groups aged 60 and older.Once the level of migration was estimated, the next step was to establish more formally the place-level characteristics associated with a county's status as a retirement migration destination. Questions such as the role of differentials in natural resource endowments, economic base, demographic structure, and political variables (including tax rates) needed to be considered.More specifically, I posited associations between retirement migration and the following economic, demographic, and geographic measures. These were expressed in terms of the analysis of estimated migration between 1950 and 1960; the geographic variables remain invariant for subsequent analyses of 1960–70, 1970–80, and 1980–90 migration whereas the demographic and economic variables apply to the beginning of each decade for these analyses.Geographic: coastal location; location in Florida; presence of a commercial airport; level of urbanization in 1950.Demographic: total White population in 1950; share of total White population aged 60+ in 1950; share of total population which was White in 1950.Economic/structural: median gross rent in 1950; per capita property taxes in 1957; share of local government expenditures for police protection in 1962.The geographic variables measured the extent to which location matters in the choice of a retirement destination. The airport variable was a proxy for an area's accessibility for the comparatively affluent retirees who tend to comprise most of the older interstate movers (Serow 1996   ). The importance of Florida in the retirement migration process was treated in two ways: (a) as a dummy variable in regression analysis of all 837 rural Southeastern counties, and (b) as a means of disaggregating the entire universe. The demographic variables measured the role that initial population size and age structure as well as ethnic similarity (recall that the analysis was limited to older Whites) played in the location decision. The economic variables captured cost of living and relative taxation effects; also included here was the only comparable measure of "safety" available prior to 1971, the share of 1962 local government expenditures devoted to police protection. Subsequently, the crime rate (number of crimes known by the police per 100,000 persons) as reported in 1975 and in 1985 was used for this purpose. Results Migration Estimates State-level summary data, showing estimated migration, end-of-period population in the counties included in the universe, and migration's impact on the size of the older population, are given in  Table 1  . The difference in the relative and absolute volume of retirement migration between Florida and any other state in the region is immediately obvious. Even with Florida's largest and most urbanized counties excluded from the universe, the estimated volume of net migration among older Whites to Florida doubled between 1950–60 and 1960–70 and again between 1960–70 and 1970–80. Overall, migration's contribution to the size of the state's older population had been remarkably stable over the four intercensal periods, with net migration representing roughly 40% of the number of older Whites at each end point. By way of comparison, the estimated volume of net migration of older Whites to North Carolina (second to Florida in terms of population size in 1990 and in terms of net migration during the 1980–1990 decade) was less than one tenth that estimated for Florida.Although all states in the region (except West Virginia and occasionally Kentucky) had generally experienced population gains in their older White population through migration, only Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina had consistently gained through migration at rates in excess of the regional total (omitting Florida) and only these states, along with South Carolina (and Florida) had experienced consistent increases over time in their estimated volume of net migration of older Whites. Only in Delaware had migration's share of end-of-period population risen steadily over time. Generally, the overall pattern of stability suggested by the summary results in  Table 1  suggest a continuation of trends previously identified by Flynn, Longino, Wiseman, and Biggar 1985   .The total White population aged 60 and older as well as the older White population residing in the counties in the study universe are shown for each Southeastern state in  Table 2  . These data are given for both the beginning (1950) and final dates of the period. Overall, this project incorporated localities with 62% of the region's older White population in 1950, declining slightly to 57% by 1990. Delaware, Florida, and Maryland were the only states where less than half the older White population was included in the analysis in either (and both) 1950 and 1990. However, these states (along with Georgia and, marginally, South Carolina) were the only ones where the share of population residing in the initially rural portions of the state grew at a faster pace over the entire 1950–1990 period than did the population of the more urban areas. Fig. 1  shows those counties that exceeded the average regional levels of net in-migration of older Whites by at least one standard deviation for the entire 1950–1990 period. I would suggest that this set of 64 counties (36 in Florida, 28 elsewhere throughout the region) constitute the core of areas that had consistently served as magnets for retirees throughout the entire post World War II period. As suggested by sheer numbers, the 36 Florida counties (of 55 in the universe of rural counties included in this article) are widespread throughout the state, covering all nonurbanized counties bordering on the Atlantic coast, all nonurbanized counties bordering on the Gulf Coast south of the "Big Bend," and all but two nonurbanized interior counties south of Gainesville. It is only across the northern tier of the state that retirement migration is not the absolute norm, and even here six coastal northwest counties are included in the retirement core. Tables showing estimated levels of migration for all 837 rural Southeastern counties are available upon request (see  Table A1  1, Note 1).In addition to the Florida concentration, two other overarching patterns emerge. Much of the retirement migration in the northernmost part of the Southeast region (in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia) had been consistently occurring just beyond the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas. Core retirement areas are concentrated in four small northeastern coastal counties of Virginia and in coastal areas of Maryland and Delaware (all three localities in these states). All are immediately adjacent to one or the other of these metropolitan areas. Similarly, five of nine Georgia counties identified here are on the fringe of or adjacent to metropolitan Atlanta. In many of these as well as in some nonmetropolitan counties, the growth through migration of the elderly seems to have served as a precursor to more general population growth through migration (Fuguitt and Beale 1993   ; Fuguitt and Tordella 1980   ).The other pattern is the concentration of retirement areas in mountain and coastal locations: (a) five of six North Carolina localities, (b) three Georgia mountain counties (proximate to the North Carolina mountain counties), (c) two coastal counties in South Carolina, and (d) single coastal counties in Alabama and Mississippi. Other core retirement areas include the county incorporating Pinehurst in North Carolina and single counties adjacent to the metropolitan fringes of Augusta (Georgia) and Memphis and Nashville (Tennessee). Determinants of Migration These locational findings are the initial phase of the results presented. The results of ordinary least-squares regression analyses between migration proportions of elderly Whites and the foregoing set of independent variables are summarized in  Table 3  (see  Table A1  1, Note 2). To isolate the nontrivial role played by Florida in the retirement migration process for the rural Southeast, I show two specifications for the model: the first includes a separate dummy variable that is set equal to one when the county in question is located in Florida; the second removes all 55 rural Florida counties from the universe.In the models where Florida location was incorporated as a dummy variable, between 40% (for 1960–70) and 50% (other three decades) of the overall variance in elderly migration was captured by the model. More than half the total variance explained in each case was through the Florida dummy, although the relative importance of other variables was somewhat greater for 1970–80 and (especially) 1980–90 (see  Table A1  1, Note 3).Consider first the demographic variables. Although overall population size seems irrelevant to a county's status as a retirement destination, the extent of similarity between a locality's population and potential elderly migrants seems to matter quite a bit. Both the initial share of a county's population composed of older persons and the initial share composed of Whites were always positively related to in-migration and statistically significant.In terms of geographic correlates, the initial level of urbanization was positively associated with in-migration during the 1950s but negatively thereafter. One might surmise that the first localities to emerge as retirement destinations may have possessed sufficient amenities to attract the first post World War II generation of retirement migrants, but other considerations and subsequent urban development may have overcome this initial advantage. This observation is supported by the initially important role of commercial air service, which completely disappears after the initial decade. A county's location on either the Atlantic or the Gulf coast was a consistently important predictor of the locality's attractiveness to potential in-migrants.The social and economic variables generally do not exert the sort of influence that one might expect both from a theoretical perspective as well as from the literature on destination choice among elderly migrants. Median rent, chosen as a proxy for county-level living costs, was consistently and positively related to migration rates from 1960 onwards. Similarly, local property taxes per capita, which should also serve as a repellent force to potential migrants, was occasionally statistically significant but always in the opposite direction! In like fashion, crime rates for 1970 and 1980 were also positively associated with migration, but this may well reflect the well-known effect of these rates not adequately reflecting the population at risk (areas with substantial tourism typically had a relatively high incidence of crime partially due to the failure to count tourism days in the denominator of the crime rate as conventionally measured). As for taxes and living costs, there are two plausible explanations: (a) these variables may actually be tapping into an income-type effect; (b) these issues may be relatively unimportant in the location decision when the universe is restricted (as here) to rural places within the same overall region. Perhaps difficult to measure variables such as climactic preferences or proximity to family and friends are really the driving force.When the analysis was restricted to counties outside the state of Florida, the overall explanatory power of the model lessened considerably, especially during the 1960s when only 6% of overall variance was explained. Otherwise, application of the same set of variables as described above (lacking the Florida dummy) explained about one third as much variance as did the model incorporating Florida counties, with the value of R2 notably higher in the most recent decade. In general, the variables behaved in precisely the same fashion as was the case when Florida's counties were included in the analysis. Specifically, both period initial demographic structure and coastal location persist as important measures of association for in-migration of elderly Whites to rural Southeastern (non-Florida) counties. These relationships are quite robust, with little variation in relative importance since 1950. For the three most recent decades, the median gross rent made the largest contribution to the model's explanatory power, albeit operating in the direction opposite from that hypothesized (see  Table A1  1, Note 4). If indeed rental values are serving as a proxy for the level of income, these results suggest that retirees are attracted to places with coastal location whose existing populations have consistently achieved some measure of prosperity and are not dissimilar from the retirees themselves. Discussion The results presented here support much, but not all, of the conventional wisdom regarding a locality's prospective attractiveness. Most striking is the failure of living costs or local taxation levels to play the hypothesized role of deterrent to migrating retirees. Unfortunately, existing aggregate data at the county level do not provide for measurement of the presence of family and friends at the prospective destination, a variable that has repeatedly been demonstrated to be of paramount importance to retirement-age long-distance migrants.Because this article analyzes migration at the county rather than the state level, it is able to provide insight for those localities considering retiree recruitment as an economic development strategy. It specifically suggests that many of the characteristics that attract retirees may not be amenable to change by local governmental or civic action. The model developed here clearly can be better specified with the direct inclusion of variables measuring local income, a measure of climate other than coastal location, and a better measure of accessibility such as presence of a four-lane divided highway or the like. Nonetheless, it appears that some level of economic prosperity is a precondition for attractiveness to retirees. Consequently, retiree recruitment might logically be secondary to other strategies for local economic development. Prosperity suggests the availability of local infrastructure—recreation, culture, health care, and the like. These results suggest that development of local infrastructure should precede retiree recruitment, rather than assuming that the direct and indirect economic effects of retiree spending will provide the funds for this infrastructure. Development of these "tourism" amenities may well lead to a longer run pattern of retirement migration. Other related strategies also emerge. If retiree recruitment is chosen as a development strategy, those responsible for carrying it out might advertise existing retirement locations in out-of-state media. Similarly, they might encourage and facilitate retirement-oriented housing development in coastal or mountain areas, especially those areas proximate to smaller metropolitan centers.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract This analysis uses data from the 1990 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to identify the individual-level characteristics that influence residential dependence among immigrants age 60 and older in the United States. Particular attention is given to differences among 11 immigrant groups. Separate models are shown by gender and marital status. The results indicate that Hispanic and most Asian immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, Central or South America, India, and the Pacific Islands, are at a greater risk of living with family than non-Hispanic White immigrants. Although resource, need, and demographic characteristics influence the risk of living with family, these individual-level characteristics do not explain the observed differences across the immigrant groups. These findings suggest that preferences that are shaped by the immigrant's experience as well as cultural background are an important determinant of immigrant living arrangements in later life.   Residential dependence ,  Immigrant groups ,  Cultural preferences Vernon L. Greene, PhDBetween 1990 and 2050, the older population in the United States will become increasingly diverse, with the proportion of the older population that is non-White projected to increase from 10.2% to 21.3% (Taeuber 1990   ). The growth in the non-White segment of the older population is fueled not only by the aging of younger cohorts born in the United States but also by immigration. Over the last 40 years, immigration streams have shifted toward Latin American and Asian countries (Muller and Espenshade 1985   ). The basis for entry has also changed, with preference being given to family members of immigrants and those with desirable occupational skills or investments. These changes are not only increasing the ethnic diversity of younger immigrant cohorts that will grow old in the United States but have also increased the number of older immigrants (Treas 1997   ; U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 1993   ).Despite the growing number of older immigrants in the United States, there are few studies that explicitly examine living arrangements within this group. Living arrangements among older immigrants are important to understand because each immigrant group has cultural preferences and individual-level characteristics that can potentially influence residential independence in later life. Previous research on the entire older population has shown that living arrangements influence the well-being of older adults and their family, while shaping reliance upon informal and formal social supports. For example, independent living arrangements—living either alone or with a spouse—are considered the most desirable for older adults in the United States because they offer more autonomy. However, these living arrangements (in particular living alone) can increase social isolation and reliance upon formal social supports. Because all individuals aged 60 or over in the United States are eligible for community services according to Title III of the Older Americans Act, understanding the characteristics of older adults who live independently and need assistance is essential to governmental policy formation and program planning.Studies of ethnic living arrangements provide some insight into immigrants' living arrangements (Angel, Angel, Lee, and Markides 1999   ; Burr and Mutchler 1992   , Burr and Mutchler 1993a   , Burr and Mutchler 1993b   ; Himes, Hogan, and Eggebeen 1996   ; Kamo and Zhou 1994   ). These studies suggest that immigrants who arrived more recently, are less acculturated, and have fewer economic resources are more likely to live in multigenerational households. Furthermore, there are substantial racial and ethnic differences in the propensity of older adults to live in multigenerational households. Yet most of these studies provide limited information about immigrants because they are primarily concerned with explaining ethnic, not immigrant, living arrangements.A few studies explicitly compare the living arrangements of immigrant and native-born older adults in the general population. In an analysis of older female immigrant living arrangements in Canada, Boyd 1991    found that immigrant women are more likely than native-born women to have extended family arrangements in later life. In addition, there are differences in the propensity to live with family among immigrants. A key defining factor is age at immigration: Women who immigrated at older ages are more likely to have extended family living arrangements. These later life immigrants tend to have characteristics that increase the likelihood of extended family living arrangements, such as lower levels of education and income, poorer English or French speaking skills, and more children.Similar to Boyd 1991    findings in Canada, Wilmoth, De Jong, and Himes 1997    found that immigrants in the United States, particularly those aged 60 or older upon arrival, are more likely to live in extended family arrangements and less likely to live independently than older nonimmigrants. Furthermore, the differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant living arrangements are not due to differences in population composition, economic resources, functional limitations, or acculturation (Wilmoth et al. 1997   ).Because previous research on older immigrants in the United States has been primarily concerned with either explaining the living arrangements of specific ethnic groups or comparing immigrants to nonimmigrants, it does not identify the individual-level characteristics that influence living arrangements among older immigrants. Further, it has not systematically documented living arrangement differences across and within particular immigrant groups. These differences are important to consider because each immigrant group has unique demographic characteristics, life experiences, and cultural beliefs that can potentially influence later life living arrangements.Therefore, the purpose of this research is: (a) to identify the distribution of living arrangements across and within older non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and Asian immigrant groups, taking into account differences by gender and marital status; and (b) to determine whether differences in living arrangements across these groups can be attributed to cultural preferences or other individual-level factors including acculturation, resources, needs, and availability of children. Determinants of Immigrant Living Arrangements in Later Life Immigrant living arrangements in later life are a function of preferences, resources and needs, and availability of children.Preferences are often inferred through measures of race and ethnicity. Numerous studies have documented variation in the living arrangements of older Americans by race and ethnicity. It is widely accepted that older Hispanic and Asian Americans are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to live with family (Burr and Mutchler 1992   , Burr and Mutchler 1993a   ; Himes et al. 1996   ; Kamo and Zhou 1994   ). The distinct living arrangements of minority elders are most often attributed to economic need and cultural traditions that influence living arrangement preferences (Angel and Tienda 1982   ; Burr and Mutchler 1993b   ; Himes et al. 1996   ). However, factors related to acculturation and immigration also influence minority living arrangements. Studies on minority elders' living arrangements that control for acculturation and immigration status consistently indicate that foreign-born individuals, particularly those who are less acculturated and have immigrated more recently, are significantly more likely to be living with family members in later life (Angel, Angel, McClellan, and Markides 1996   , 1999; Burr 1992   ; Burr and Mutchler 1992   , Burr and Mutchler 1993a   , Burr and Mutchler 1993b   ; Kamo and Zhou 1994   ).The influence of acculturation and immigrant status on later life living arrangements can be partially explained by immigrants' experiences. Immigrants brings living arrangement preferences, often preferences for extended family living arrangements, with them from their country of origin. While cross-cultural comparisons of elderly living arrangements are not common, there is evidence that multigenerational households are more common among older adults in Central and South America, as well as Asian and Eastern European countries, than in Western Europe or North America (De Vos 1990   ; Martin 1988   ; Wall 1989   ; Wolf 1990   , Wolf 1995   ). The prevalence of multigenerational households in these countries can be attributed to cultural beliefs regarding reciprocity within the family, norms pertaining to the appropriate living arrangement of older adults, and the availability of housing.For example, the structure of households in the northwestern part of Europe, as well as North America, has historically been focused on the nuclear family. Cultural norms in those countries that advocate self-determination, independence, and individualism encourage the increased residential privacy that is offered in nuclear households (Simic 1990   ). As a result, Scandinavian countries have the highest percentage of older adults living alone, followed by other northwestern European and North American countries. In contrast, extended multigenerational households are more common in Eastern, Central, and Southern Europe, where the norms regarding individualism are not as strong and family members are more economically interdependent. Countries in these regions of Europe tend to have a relatively low percentage of older adults living alone (Wall 1989   ; Wolf 1995   ).Hispanic culture, which is prevalent in Central and South American countries, is characterized by strong kinship bonds, frequent intergenerational interaction, mutual exchanges between extended family members, and hierarchical family relationships (Becerra 1988   ; Sanchez-Ayendez 1988   ; Szapoczink and Hernandez 1988   ). These family-oriented cultural values create normative obligations to other family members, particularly older adults (Markides and Mindel 1987   ), which can increase likelihood of extended family living arrangements. In fact, previous research suggests that a majority of older adults in Latin America do live in extended family households (De Vos 1990   ).The situation is similar in Asian countries, where approximately 75% of older adults live with their children (Martin 1988   ). However, the cultural values driving extended family living arrangements in this region of the world are different. Buddhism and Confucianism, in conjunction with rural folk religions, tend to increase the status of older adults in many Asian countries. The practices of ancestor worship, filial piety, and primogeniture encourage Asian youth to revere and respect older adults (Kiefer 1990   ; Olson 1990   ). Individuals are encouraged to subvert personal needs and desires in the interests of larger groups, including the family, and there are strong norms of reciprocity (Akiyama, Antonucci, and Campbell 1990   ; Kiefer 1990   ). Multigenerational households are common because these cultural traditions encourage elderly parents to live with children, primarily the oldest son. In urban areas, where exposure to Western values should place downward pressure on such extended family living arrangements, shortages in housing supplies and limited state-supported social services maintain a high level of multigenerational households (Logan, Bian, and Bian 1998   ; Olson 1990   ).As this discussion indicates, immigrants from various regions of the world should arrive in the United States with culturally based preferences for extended family living arrangements. The strength of this preference should vary across different immigrant groups. Once in the United States, national immigration policies that encourage family reunification reinforce country-of-origin living arrangement preferences by requiring sponsors to sign nonbinding affidavits of support. Together, individual preferences rooted in specific cultural traditions and national immigration policies foster family living arrangements among immigrants by increasing family-oriented obligations (Boyd 1991   ; Wilmoth et al. 1997   ). However, acculturation should decrease the likelihood of living with family.The increased likelihood of living with family among immigrants may not be due to preferences, but other individual-level characteristics, such as resources, needs, and availability of children. Previous research consistently shows that economic resources facilitate independent living arrangements because these resources enable older individuals to purchase preferred living environments as well as services that maintain independent living (Burr and Mutchler 1993a   ; Soldo, Wolf, and Agree 1990   ). For minorities and immigrants, extended family living arrangements can be seen as a strategy to pool income and other resources, particularly at key points in the life course (Angel and Tienda 1982   ; Blank 1998   ; Blank and Torrechilha 1998   ; Worobey and Angel 1990a   ). Thus, extended family living arrangements among older adults are not necessarily initiated because of the needs of the aging individual. Family finances or other circumstances, such as the required care of a child or older adult, can prompt the formation of multigenerational households.In addition to economic resources, health status also influences living arrangements in later life. Declining health decreases the likelihood of independent living arrangements while increasing the likelihood of dependent living arrangements (Angel 1991   ; Avery, Speare, and Lawton 1989   ; Mutchler and Burr 1991   ). Overall, however, economic resources are believed to have the most influence on later life living arrangements. Independent living arrangements are often maintained among older adults with more economic resources even when their health fails (Soldo et al. 1990   ; Worobey and Angel 1990b   ).Number of children is often used as a measure of the potential pool of people with whom an older adult can coreside. Overall, number of children is negatively related to the likelihood of living alone; older adults without children or with only one child are significantly more likely to be living alone (Avery et al. 1989   ; Soldo et al. 1990   ). Women with daughters only are more likely to be living with a child than women with only sons, while women with both sons and daughters have intermediate probabilities of living with a child (Soldo et al. 1990   ). Although these studies do not specifically consider how the availability of children affects immigrant living arrangements, it is reasonable to expect similar results among immigrants.Finally, it is important to note that later life arrangements are systematically related to gender and marital status. Married older adults are more likely to be living only with a spouse, while unmarried older adults are more likely to be living alone. Furthermore, women are more likely to live alone or with family than men because of gender differences in mortality (Siegel 1993   ). As a result, many studies of older adult living arrangements (e.g., Boyd 1991   ; Burr and Mutchler 1992   ; Choi 1991   ; Soldo, Sharma, and Campbell 1984   ; Wolf and Soldo 1988   ) specify separate models based on gender and marital status.To summarize, it is expected that the distribution of living arrangements will vary across different immigrant groups. In particular, Hispanic and Asian immigrants are expected to be more likely to live with family than White immigrants—especially White immigrants from North America and Western Europe. Furthermore, variation is expected within each immigrant group due to specific country-of-origin cultural beliefs and practices. It is expected that some of this variation across and within groups will be accounted for by individual-level characteristics including acculturation, resources and needs, and availability of children. Methods The data for this analysis come from the 1990 5% Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1993). These data contain household and individual-level data from the long-form questionnaires that are distributed to approximately 1 in 6 households. In order to reduce computation time and cost, an extract was taken from the PUMS that contains all minority respondents aged 60 or over and a 1 in 10 random sample of White older adults. As there were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, or marital status between the total White sample and the 10% random sample, the random sample of White elders is considered to be nationally representative.The citizenship and year of entry into the United States items are used to determine immigrant status. The only respondents included in the analysis are individuals who were citizens of another country at birth and subsequently moved to the United States (n = 63,953). All respondents born in the United States or overseas to citizens of the United States are considered nonimmigrants and thus are excluded from the analysis.Similar to previous research (e.g., Burr 1992   ; Burr and Mutchler 1992   ; Mutchler and Burr 1991   ), living arrangements are operationalized in terms of complexity and householder status. For this analysis, immigrants could be in one of four living arrangements: alone, with spouse only, with family as the householder (i.e., the person listed in column 1 of the census form who is generally considered to be the head of the household), and with family not as the householder. Living alone and living with a spouse only are collapsed into a single reference category called independent living arrangements. Identifying whether an older adult living with family is the householder is an important indicator of dependence (Burr 1992   ; Burr and Mutchler 1992   ; Mutchler and Burr 1991   ). According to the U.S. Census Bureau definition, the householder is either the homeowner or the renter of the property, which suggests the individual is economically independent. For this analysis, women who are married to the householder are also classified as a householder. Being the householder, or married to the householder, implies access to and control of more economic resources. Therefore, living with family as a householder suggests an interdependent living arrangement, and living with family without being the householder can be considered a more dependent living arrangement.Although living in an institution is the most dependent living arrangement, institutionalized respondents are excluded from the analysis for two reasons. First, rates of institutionalization are low for immigrants (Wilmoth et al. 1997   ). Second, because information on personal income is not available for institutionalized respondents and income is related to the chance of institutionalization, it is not possible to correctly specify a model for this group. Immigrants living with nonrelatives are excluded from the analysis because there were not a sufficient number to identify immigrant group differences by gender and marital status.One of the strengths of the PUMS data is that there are enough cases in the most common living arrangement categories to provide a detailed comparison of immigrant groups. The questions on self-identified race, Hispanic origin, place of birth, and ancestry are used to identify 11 immigrant groups: three non-Hispanic White groups (from North America or Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and other countries), four Hispanic groups (from Mexico, Central and South America, Cuba, and other countries), and four Asian groups (from China or Taiwan, Japan, India, or other countries). Blacks (from African or other countries) and Native American Indians (from Canada or Central and South America) are excluded from the analysis because neither group has enough immigrants to support a multivariate analysis. These immigrant group measures capture the effect of country-of-origin cultural preferences for particular living arrangements within three general ethnoracial groups.The analysis includes three items that control for acculturation. The first is a measure of age at immigration. This item is constructed from age in 1990 and the year of immigration item. Because the year of immigration variable is categorical, the upper and lower bounds of the year categories were used to determine the potential range of ages within which the respondent immigrated. The mean of the age range was used as the age at immigration. For this analysis, the age at immigration was collapsed into a dichotomous variable that controls for immigration at age 60 or older.The second measure of acculturation controls for the year of immigration. This variable includes four categories: prior to 1965 (reference category), 1966–1974, 1975–1984, and 1985–1990. Immigration prior to 1965 is used as the reference category because 1965 marks the point at which migration streams shifted toward Latin American and Asian countries. This variable not only controls for this shift in migration streams but also how recently the respondent immigrated. It is expected that the more recent the immigration, the less time the respondent has had to be acculturated. Subsequently, more recent immigrants should be more likely to live with family. Although this variable will serve as an important control, it will not be possible to distinguish between the effects of entry time period and the effects of years since entry, because to do so would require at least two cross-sections of data (Borjas 1985   ).English language proficiency is the final measure of acculturation. Respondents who are unable to speak English or who speak English poorly are coded as "poor," and respondents who speak English well, very well, or only speak English are coded as "good" (reference category). Being able to speak English proficiently is not only necessary for independent living but it is also a primary means of exposing immigrants to the dominant culture. Individuals who have better English language skills should be more acculturated and thus less likely to live with family in later life.Personal income, education, and functional limitations serve as the measures of resource and need factors. Personal income is measured continuously in U.S. dollars. Education is coded to have three categories: high school or less, high school graduate (reference), and some college or more. The functional limitation variable was taken from the questions: "Because of a health condition that has lasted 6 or more months, does this person have any difficult (a) going outside the home alone, for example, to shop or visit a doctor's office? Or (b) taking care of his or her own personal needs, such as bathing, dressing, or getting around inside the home?" The recoded variable in this analysis has three categories: having no limitations (reference category), having a mobility or personal care limitation, having both mobility and personal care limitations. While these measures of functional health are rather crude, they are the only measures of functional limitations available in the PUMS data.Unfortunately, PUMS has limited information regarding the availability of children. Only female respondents provide information regarding the number of children ever born, and there are no questions concerning the gender composition of children or proximity of children. Thus, this analysis can only include a limited control for availability (i.e., number of children) in the models for unmarried and married women. This is an important limitation of these data and must be considered when interpreting the results.These measures are first used in a descriptive analysis that focuses on the distribution of living arrangements among the immigrant groups by gender and marital status. Then, multinomial logistic regression models are presented that predict living arrangements. Separate models are specified by gender and marital status. The reference category of each model is independent living arrangements (i.e., living alone or with a spouse only). The descriptive statistics and multivariate models will be presented together for each gender/marital status group: unmarried men, married men, unmarried women, and married women. Then, similarities and differences across these four groups will be summarized.The purpose of the multivariate models is to determine whether controlling for individual-level characteristics accounts for the observed differences across the immigrant groups. If controlling for these variables eliminates the significant differences across the immigrant groups, it will imply that observed differences in living arrangements are due to variation in individual-level characteristics. Conversely, if these controls do not influence the differences across immigrants groups, it suggests that cultural preferences influence immigrant living arrangements.Partial models that sequentially entered the acculturation, resource, need, and availability measures were estimated to identify which set of variables account for group differences. The magnitude of the coefficients did not vary enough across these models to justify presenting the partial models in the tables (partial models are available from the author upon request). The few differences between the partial and the full models are noted in the text. Results Characteristics of Older Immigrants  Table 1  presents the weighted characteristics of older immigrants in the sample. The majority are female (58%) and are married (60%). Half of the immigrants are Hispanic, primarily from either Mexico or Cuba, one third are Asian, mostly from Central and Southeast Asia or China, and less than one fifth are non-Hispanic White, usually from European countries. About one fifth immigrated to the United States at age 60 or older, one quarter arrived during the past 15 years, and almost half rate their English language proficiency as poor. Most did not graduate from high school (64%) and have no limitations (78%). The average number of children for female respondents is 3.58. Descriptive Statistics and Multivariate Models by Gender and Marital Status Unmarried Men.  Table 2  presents the living arrangement distributions for each immigrant group by gender and marital status. The first panel, for unmarried men, indicates that independent living is the most common living arrangement among unmarried male immigrants. However, there is considerable variation across the immigrant groups. Non-Hispanic Whites are the most likely to live independently and the least likely to live with family. Approximately two fifths to one half of unmarried Hispanic men live independently. Among older Hispanic men, Mexican immigrants are the least likely to live independently (40.5%) and the most likely to live with family as the householder (24.8%), whereas Cuban immigrants are the most likely to live independently (51.9%). The variation is much greater among Asian immigrants. Unmarried Asian men from India are the least likely to live independently (27.4%) and the most likely to live with family without being the householder (62.9%). In contrast, more than half (56.4%) of unmarried male immigrants from Japan live independently.The first column of  Table 3  , which presents the multinomial logistic coefficients for unmarried male immigrants, indicates that the differences across the groups persist even after controlling for other characteristics. Three groups are similar to Whites from North America or Western Europe—Whites from Eastern Europe, Whites from other countries, and Asian Japanese. Whites from Eastern Europe are only more likely to live with family as the householder and Asians from Japan are only more likely to live with family without being the householder. White immigrants from other countries are not significantly different from the reference group (North American or Western European Whites).All other immigrant groups are significantly more likely to be living with family, regardless of householder status, than Whites from North America or Western Europe. For unmarried men, the likelihood of living with a family as the householder is particularly high among Asians from other countries and Hispanic Mexicans, whereas the likelihood of living with a family without being the householder is highest among Asians from India. Married Men. The second panel of  Table 2  , which presents the results for married male immigrants, reveals that living independently is most common among those who are White, Japanese, or Cuban. For the rest of the immigrant groups the most common living arrangement for married men is with family as the householder. It is interesting to note that for married men the highest rate of living with family without being the householder (9.9%) is among Asian Indians.The second column in  Table 3  presents the multivariate models for married male immigrants. All of the groups, except Whites from Eastern Europe and Asians from Japan, are more likely to live with family even after controlling for other characteristics. Married Japanese men are only more likely to live with family as the householder. Overall, for married men, the likelihood of living with family as the householder is highest among Asians from India and other countries, as well as Hispanics from Mexico and Central/South America. These groups also have the highest risk of living with family without being the householder. Unmarried Women. The distribution of living arrangements among unmarried female immigrants is similar to that of unmarried male immigrants; however, unmarried women are generally less likely to live independently and more likely to live with family without being the householder. White, as well as Japanese, immigrants are the most likely to live independently. Living with family without being the householder is more common among Hispanic and Asian immigrants. However, there is considerable variation within each of these groups—particularly among Asian immigrants. For example, 85% of unmarried female immigrants from India live with family without being the householder, compared to only 28.6% of those from Japan. Interestingly, the highest rates of unmarried women living with family as the householders are among Hispanic groups, with the percentage ranging from 17.7% among Cuban immigrants to 25.3% among Mexican immigrants.The first column of  Table 4  presents the multivariate model for unmarried female immigrants. All of the immigrant groups are more likely to be living with family, regardless of householder status, except two—Whites from Eastern Europe and Asians from Japan. Partial models (not shown) indicate that the coefficients for Japanese immigrants become nonsignificant after controlling for acculturation and number of children. Therefore, living arrangement differences between unmarried female Japanese immigrants and the reference group can be attributed to differences in acculturation and availability of children. Overall, among unmarried female immigrants, the risk of living with family is highest among Asians from India and other countries, as well as Hispanics from Central or South America. Married Women. As shown in the last panel of  Table 2  , married female immigrants are more likely to live independently and less likely to live with family as the householder (or spouse of the householder) than married male immigrants. Once again, married female immigrants who are White or Japanese are the most likely to live independently. The rates are lower among the Hispanic groups, with those from Cuba and other Hispanic countries being the most likely to live independently (56.7% and 51.5% respectively). Asian immigrants from India and other countries are the least likely to live independently and the most likely to live with family as the householder (or spouse of the householder). Rates of living with family without being the householder are also high among these two Asian groups. All the groups, except Whites from Eastern Europe and Asians from Japan, are significantly different from Whites from North America or Western Europe.The second panel of  Table 4  presents the model for married female immigrants. Whites from Eastern Europe and Japanese immigrants are not significantly different from the reference group. Whites from other countries are only more likely to be living with family without being the householder. All other groups are significantly more likely to be living with family regardless of householder status. Overall, the highest risks of living with family are among Asian immigrants from India and other countries, followed by Hispanic immigrants from Mexico and Central/South America. Summary Overall,  Table 2  demonstrates the considerable variation in living arrangements across the immigrant groups. Among unmarried male and female immigrants, the distribution of living arrangements among Whites from North America or Western Europe is significantly different from the distribution among all the Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups. Among married male and female immigrants, the living arrangement distribution among Whites from North America or Western Europe is significantly different from Whites from other countries as well as all the Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups.Keeping this variation in mind, rates of dependent living arrangements (i.e., living with family without being the householder) are highest among unmarried female immigrants. Rates of interdependent living arrangements (i.e., living with family as the householder or married to the householder) are highest among married males and females. Regardless of gender or marital status, the highest rates of independent living arrangements (i.e., alone or with a spouse only) are among White, Japanese, and Cuban immigrants.These observed differences in living arrangements could be due to variation in individual-level characteristics. Therefore, multinomial logistic regression models were tested that include controls for acculturation, resources and needs, and availability of children.  Table 3  and  Table 4  indicate that controlling for these variables does not explain the increased risk of living with family among the various immigrant groups.In terms of the other variables in the model, acculturation generally decreases the likelihood of family living arrangements. Migration at age 60 or older decreases the likelihood of living with family as the householder for married men and unmarried women, while increasing the likelihood of living with family without being the householder for married men, unmarried women, and married women. Recent immigration and poor English language proficiency increase the risk of living with family.Limited resources and high needs tend to increase the likelihood of family living arrangements. Specifically, income tends to decrease the risk of living with family for men and women, with two important exceptions. Income increases the risk of living with family as the householder for unmarried women but was not a significant predictor of living with family as the householder for unmarried men. Immigrants with less than a high school education are not more likely to be living with family than immigrants who are high school graduates. However, having a college education decreases the likelihood of living with family as the householder for married men and decreases the likelihood of living with family without being the householder for unmarried as well as married men. Finally, physical limitations decrease the risk of living with family as the householder for married men and women, but increase the risk of living with family without being the householder for unmarried men and women.The effect of child availability could only be assessed in the models for women. Regardless of marital status, number of children increases the likelihood of living with family for female immigrants. Most likely, number of children is also influential for men, but the nature of this relationship can not be determined because of data limitations. Discussion As Gelfand 1989    points out, "Although there is a substantial literature on the problems of immigrants, the issues faced by older immigrants have been for the most part neglected" (p. 367). This research has attempted to address this gap in the literature by examining differences in living arrangements among older immigrants. Overall, the findings suggest that the factors influencing living arrangements among the general population in the United States also influence living arrangements among the immigrant population. Similar to the findings of previous research (e.g., Burr and Mutchler 1993b   ; Himes et al. 1996   ; Wilmoth et al. 1997   ), later life living arrangements among immigrants are influenced by racial and ethnic characteristics, which are generally considered indirect measures of cultural preference for particular living arrangements in later life. However, immigrants have the added influence of acculturation. Immigrants who have arrived relatively recently, were age 60 or older upon arrival, and who have poor English language skills are the least likely to have residential autonomy in later life.Although some of the acculturation, resource, need, and availability measures are significant, controlling for these characteristics did not explain the group differences in living arrangements. The one exception was for unmarried female Asian immigrants from Japan. Controlling for acculturation and, in particular, number of children did explain the higher rates of living with family among this group. However, the inability of these controls to eliminate the majority of the group differences suggests that preferences, which are shaped by the immigrant experience as well as cultural background, influence immigrant living arrangements in later life. Although it is not possible to directly measure preference with census data, this finding is consistent with previous research (Himes et al. 1996   ; Wilmoth et al. 1997   ), which concludes that indirect measures of cultural preference are important determinants of later life living arrangements, particularly among minority immigrants. Preferences, along with resource, need, and availability factors, set the stage for later life living arrangements among this group.This analysis also indicates that there are different propensities to live in multigenerational households across and within the various groups. Consistent with the findings of Himes and colleagues 1996    regarding minority elders, older Asian and Hispanic immigrants are more likely than non-Hispanic White immigrants to live with family. However, the findings also indicate that there is considerable variation within specific older minority immigrant groups. This suggests that combining respondents from different countries of origin might not be appropriate when studying the living arrangements of immigrants, particularly Hispanic and Asian immigrants.While the risk of living with family was relatively similar among the non-Hispanic White groups, there was considerable variation within the Hispanic and Asian groups. Among the Hispanic groups, those from Cuba had the lowest risk of living with family. While this group exhibits strong kinship bonds, Cuban families in the United States started becoming nuclear more than 30 years ago (Szapoczink and Hernandez 1988   ). Among immigrants from Asia, Japanese immigrants have notably different living arrangements. However, there is evidence that Japan is different from other Asian countries on several accounts due to the relatively high standard of living and modernization. Compared to other Asian countries, multigenerational households are less common, and the percentage of older adults living with children has been declining (Martin 1988   ). Therefore, compared to other Asian immigrants, Japanese immigrants should arrive in the United States with weaker preferences for extended family living arrangements.The PUMS data contain only one limited measure of availability of children. The number of children ever born is asked only of women, and there are no questions concerning the gender composition or proximity of children. This is a potentially important issue for model specification because previous research on the older population in the United States has shown that children decrease the likelihood of autonomous living arrangements in later life (Avery et al. 1989   ; Soldo et al. 1990   ). The models in this analysis indicate that the number of children significantly increases the chance of living with family for women, regardless of headship, but the magnitude of this effect is not great. More important, this variable does not significantly change the other coefficients in the model, including the immigrant variables (with the exception of the coefficients for Japanese women who are unmarried). Therefore, while availability of children is most likely an important predictor of living arrangements among immigrants, it does not appear to explain immigrant group variations. However, further research that is able to measure children's characteristics in more detail is required to confirm these findings.In conclusion, these findings have important implications for the future distribution of living arrangements among the older population. It can not be assumed that the proportion of older adults living alone will continue to increase in the future. Given the documented differences in later life living arrangements among minority and immigrant groups, the distribution of living arrangements among future elderly cohorts could be considerably different from those of current cohorts. The proportion of older adults living in extended family arrangements could increase as minority and immigrant populations grow, particularly if immigrants continue to have limited access to social welfare programs and sponsoring families have to assume additional responsibility. Future research should monitor changes in the distribution of living arrangements among older immigrants and assess the impact these living arrangements have on the well-being of older immigrants and their families.

     Abstract The goals of this study were to develop a valid, reliable measure of lifetime religious and spiritual experience and to assess its value in explaining late-life health. Procedures included semi-structured interviews with Duke Aging Center volunteers (n = 30), followed by structured interviews of a stratified, random sample of subjects (n = 157) from the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly at Duke University. Principal components analysis suggested four factors with favorable psychometrics. Health-impaired subjects reported a history of seeking/receiving divine aid (God Helped). At every level of impairment, Lifetime Religious Social Support and current religious attendance were positively correlated. Regardless of current attendance, subjects who reported higher Lifetime Religious Social Support received more instrumental social support. Healthy behaviors were associated with both God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support. Cost of Religiousness predicted depressive symptoms and impaired social support. Family History of Religiousness was unrelated to late-life health. Evaluation of the Spiritual History Scale in Four Dimensions (SHS-4) across geographical settings, cultural subgroups, age cohorts, and clinical samples is warranted.   Religion ,  Spirituality ,  Life course ,  Health outcomes Vernon L. Greene, PhDThe evidence that religion promotes health or improved coping with health problems in late life continues to grow (Ellison and Levin 1998   ; Koenig, Larson, and McCullough 2000   ). Although these reports are interesting, the religion and spirituality data upon which they have been based generally lack a historical perspective. Little attention has been paid to religious experience over a lifetime when estimating the attendant risk or protective effects. This study was funded by the Fetzer Foundation (Kalamazoo, MI) to examine the dynamic and multidimensional patterns of religious and spiritual practices and beliefs over the life course and to develop quantitative instrumentation for measuring religious/spiritual life histories in clinical and community samples of elders. Measuring the Past When describing the causal web of health outcomes, epidemiologists of religion have focused primarily on estimating effects of current practice and belief (Braam et al. 1998   ; Ellison 1995   ; Gardner, Sangorn, and Slattery 1995   ; Idler and Kasl 1997   ; Koenig et al. 1997   ; Krause 1993   ; Pargament et al. 1992   ; Strawbridge, Shema, Cohen, Roberts, and Kaplan 1998   ; Williams, Larson, Buckler, Heckmann, and Pyle 1991   ) or on changes during late life (Krause 1998   ; Markides, Levin, and Ray 1987   ). This strategy is consonant with common practice among epidemiologists, who often fail to exploit the multiple dimensions of historical risk for the information they might yield. Typical epidemiological studies estimate exposures as present (vs absent) or ever (vs never). Less frequently, they describe duration or accumulation of exposures over time, for instance, pack-years of smoking (Howard et al. 1998   ), lifetime frequency of severe sunburn (Elwood and Jopson 1997   ), and cumulative days of combat conditions (O'Toole et al. 1996   ). Social scientists have developed two related strategies to specify long-term risk in stress–crisis research and studies of life course. In the former, health outcomes are observed to be sequelae of distal negative life events, including childhood loss events (Brown, Harris, and Bifulco 1986   ; Landerman, George, and Blazer 1991   ) and early-life financial decisions (O'Rand and Landerman 1984   ). Life course investigators have grouped events and turning points into life course trajectories. The resulting shapes, representing stability and change over the life span, are organized into typologies of cumulative risk, and the differential impact of each type on health outcomes is estimated (Clipp, Pavalko, and Elder 1992   ; Elder 1997   ). Measuring Past Religiousness Childhood or lifetime religiousness is rarely assessed empirically, and in those studies where it is, its relationship to late-life religiousness, rather than its relationship to late-life health, is the primary focus (Blazer and Palmore 1976   ; Zinnbauer et al. 1997   ). An exception was Hunsberger 1985   , who assessed two religious history domains with single items (i.e., parental emphasis on religion during childhood and the agreement between current beliefs and those taught during childhood). The former, but not the latter, demonstrated a weak positive association with global self-rated health.More usually, one or two items that reference early-life religiousness are combined into a single scale with items referencing more recent religious activities or beliefs, making it difficult to disaggregate early from late effects. For example, two of three items in the Subjective Religiousness Scale of Chatters, Levin, and Taylor 1992    tapped current religious involvement, and the third referred to religious exposure in childhood (i.e., "the importance of religion in your home growing up"). The scale was not used to assess the effects of religion on health. In some studies, aggregated scales include items assessing "any" past history, rather than referencing a particular age or stage, for example, "(Has) organized religion…ever hindered or harmed your spiritual well-being more than it had helped?" from Moberg 1984    Religious Cynicism scale. Neither was the purpose of that study to assess religion's effects on health. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an item with negative valence was noteworthy, because the costly effects of past religious, spiritual, or existential experiences have received less attention in published reports than have neutral or health-promoting effects.When assessing past religious events, epidemiologists have devoted their primary efforts to describing the distribution of religious conversion experiences in various populations; for example, 50% of White Protestants in a national survey (Dixon, Lowery, and Jones 1992   ) and 73% in the North Carolina Piedmont study (Hays et al. 1998   ) reported such experiences. The InSpirit Religious Experiences Scale (Kass, Friedman, Leserman, Zuttermeister, and Benson 1991   ) is a more broadly conceived index of past religious experiences, and scores have been significantly correlated with declines in symptoms of stress. Systematically described religious trajectories are rare. In one exception, Hunsberger 1985    rated the "religiousness" of elders retrospectively by decade across the life span and compared them to trajectories of "happiness," finding little correspondence between the two.The paucity of measures tapping historical exposure to religion and spirituality limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding their overall effect on late-life health. On the one hand, late-life health may be primarily affected by late-life religion and spirituality, including its various dimensions and under specific circumstances. If so, investigators could concentrate on measuring more proximal religious exposures and avoid the problems inherent in attempts to measure long-past behaviors, events, and attitudes. On the other hand, late-life health may be additionally affected by religious and spiritual experiences of childhood and early and middle adulthood. If so, investigators would be empowered by the availability of valid measures to tap multiple dimensions of more distal religiousness, thus allowing enhanced specificity for estimating the effects of previous exposures.We have limited the discussion above to quantitative measures of lifetime exposure to religiousness. Such a discussion omits an important body of nonquantitative work in the tradition of studying religious development. This rich literature is exemplified in Fowler 1981   Stages of Faith, Coles 1991   The Spiritual Life of Children, and Wuthnow 1999   Growing Up Religious. We used these works, with Benson 1996    studies of loss and growth of faith over the life span and Mandelbaum 1973    studies of "turnings," to ensure a comprehensive set of probes in the early construct development phase of the current study (see Methods). In the instrument development phase, however, the authors were guided primarily by the material generated by those probes and were not constrained by categories described in previously published work on religious development.The first aim of this study was to develop and describe a valid and reliable instrument to measure lifetime experience of religion and spirituality for use in samples of elderly people. The second aim was to assess the degree to which the measure added explanatory value to the association between health status and late-life religious practices. Methods Construct Development (Phase 1) Design and Sample The study was designed in two phases, construct development and instrument development. The design of Phase 1 (construct development) was a case series of subjects (n = 30) from the Duke University Aging Center Registry, a listing of more than 1,900 community-dwelling elders in the Durham/Chapel Hill/Raleigh area who had expressed a willingness to participate in Duke Aging Center research. Subjects varied by race (33.3% African American & 66.7% White), gender (60% female), age (65–88 years), and religious tradition (13.3% Jewish, 10% Roman Catholic, 76.7% Protestant). Measures and Analysis Based on an extensive literature review, the authors developed a semistructured interview instrument to assess seven domains: demographic characteristics; religious affiliation across the life span; earliest religious or spiritual memory; characteristics of salient periods of religious or spiritual significance; frequency of 10 religious practices and overall importance of religion or spirituality across the life span; primary positive and negative influences on lifetime religiousness and spirituality; and current beliefs about creation, the human problem and its solution, eschatology, ethics, communality, and the relationship between early spiritual history and late life health. Three of the authors (JH, KM, PB) interviewed subjects face-to-face, generating taped recordings lasting 1.5–3.0 hours. Transcripts were analyzed using constant comparative analysis (Qualitative Solutions and Research 1997   ; Reinharz and Rowles 1988   ) to identify common themes and develop closed-ended items for use in Phase 2 assessments. Instrument Development (Phase 2) Design and Sample The design of Phase 2 was a cross-sectional prevalence study of a subsample from the Duke University Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (Duke/EPESE). The Duke/EPESE is a sample of approximately 2000 African American and White elders originally from Durham County, North Carolina, and four contiguous rural counties for whom 10 years of longitudinal health and social environment data are available. In 1986 and 1996 and twice in the intervening decade, the Duke/EPESE assessed health status, health services use, health behaviors, functional and cognitive status, mood, living arrangements, socioeconomic status, and measures of public and private religiousness and religious conversion experience.The sampling frame for the current study included Duke/EPESE survivors who scored 0–1 (errors) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ; Pfeiffer 1975   ), as measured at their most proximal (1996) interview. These were randomly sampled by religious affiliation, as reported at their baseline (1986) interview. The effective sample (n = 228) included 1:7 fundamentalist and pietistic Protestants, 1:2 mainline Protestants, and all affiliated and unaffiliated others, including Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Unitarian Universalists, Jehovah's Witnesses, agnostics, and atheists. Of those sampled, 15 were deceased and 6 had moved beyond an expanded 11-county tracking area since 1996. Of the remainder, 75.8% (n = 157) consented to face-to-face interviews in their home by a trained interviewer. A subgroup of these (n = 20) consented to a reliability study in which the face-to-face interview was repeated approximately 2 weeks later.We compared subjects and nonrespondents, using Duke/EPESE data. Subjects were not demographically different from nonrespondents by age (median = 80 years), gender (66% female), race (31% African American), marital status (54% married), urban-rural dwelling (61% urban), or income (33% <$10,000, 35% >$20,000), but were slightly more likely to have reported some college education. The two groups did not differ with respect to late-life religious practices reported in 1986 or 1996. Compared to nonrespondents, subjects reported similar self-rated health, impairment of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and one-year history of hospitalization, but slightly fewer physical performance and gross mobility limitations. Measures Assessment included retrospective repeated measures of religious service attendance, religious media use, and devotional activity for each of the first five decades of life, as well as currently (cross-sectional), using religion items from the Duke/EPESE (Hays et al. 1998   ). Repeated measures of "the importance of religion" (not available in the Duke/EPESE) were also assessed for each decade across the life span. Seventy items, many of which were used verbatim from Phase 1 transcripts, measured degree of agreement (or disagreement) with emergent themes. Seven items asked subjects to choose—from a limited selection—the description that best summarized selected domains of their spiritual life history (e.g., continuity of religious affiliation and presence or absence of regrets about their religious or spiritual history). Subjects also reported on 15 parameters of (at most 3) religious or spiritual turning points (e.g., their permanence and scope); four parameters of their earliest religious or spiritual memory (e.g., when and where it occurred); and the most positive and negative personal influences on their spiritual life. In addition to the religion items, selected measures from the Duke/EPESE were administered, including negative life events in the past year and incident chronic illnesses since the last interview (1996). Analysis Strategy Analyses included development of two instruments: (1) a 23-item Spiritual History Scale in four dimensions (SHS-4), based on principal components analysis (PCA) of the agree–disagree items, and (2) typologies of religious/spiritual life trajectories for the four domains of repeated measures. The former is presented here. Following Johnson and Wichern 1992   , we compared factor loadings of the 70 items with respect to quantitative criteria and construct coherence, using PCA and maximum likelihood procedures with varimax rotations. Selected items loaded >0.40 on meaningful factors across both procedures and were not correlated more than 0.70 with any other item. Three, four, and five factors were tested. The final scale ( Appendix ) included four conceptually meaningful factors with eigenvalues >1.0. We present factor loadings and test–retest reliability for the 23 items in the scale, as well as factor distributions and internal consistency in the total sample and in race and gender subgroups.Next, we describe bivariate associations between factor scores and other demographic, health status, and organizational and nonorganizational religious measures from 1986 and 1996 Duke/EPESE and from the current study. Because of the skewed distribution of the four SHS factors, all bivariate tests were nonparametric: Spearman's correlation coefficient for continuous variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum for differences between means.Last, we tested for evidence that SHS-4 factor scores explained significant variance in selected measures of late-life health and well-being, over and above that explained by late-life religiousness. Health and well-being measures from the Duke/EPESE included chronic medical conditions (Hays et al. 1998   ); basic activities of daily living (ADLs; Katz and Akpom 1976   ); physical performance (Nagi 1976   ); gross mobility (Rosow and Breslau 1966   ); instrumental ADLs (Fillenbaum 1985   ); self-rated health (Hays, Schoenfeld, Blazer, and Gold 1996   ); depressive symptoms (Radloff 1977   ); use of alcohol, and smoking. Three measures of social support (instrumental aid received and given, availability of a confidant) were also assessed (Cornoni-Huntley et al. 1990   ).As an operational measure of late-life religiousness, we used frequency of church attendance in 1996 for three reasons. First, church attendance has been the most robust religious or spiritual domain to date to correlate with the greatest variety of health outcomes. Second, the health status variables most recently measured in our sample were from 1996. Third, the 1999 church attendance score from the current study could potentially be contaminated by concurrent measures of history of religion and spirituality, the possibility of which was minimized by using a measure of attendance from three years prior. The correlation between church attendance measures from 1996 and from the current study was high (r = .79, p < .0001). Associations between health and history of religion and spirituality were adjusted for demographic confounders and weighted to account for the 1986–1996 sequential stratified sampling procedures of the Duke/EPESE; analyses were not reweighted for stratified sampling by affiliation, used in the current study. Results Spiritual History Scale Psychometrics  Table 1  presents the factor loadings from the principal components analysis of the 23-item SHS-4 scale. God Helped is an index of past help-seeking (e.g., prayed, trusted, looked for) and instrumental support received (e.g., blessings, guidance, answers, instruction, longevity) from the divine and/or from religious practices. Family History of Religiousness is an index of perceived childhood religious attachments and the religious legacy from the family of origin. Lifetime Religious Social Support is an index of adult religious participation, including indices of religious involvement in midlife and religious hospitality. Cost of Religiousness measures the presence or absence of physical, emotional, and interpersonal losses and difficulties associated with one's past religious life. Test–retest reliability estimates were favorable, with weighted kappas for 20 of the 23 items ≥0.90 (range: 0.74–1.00). Table 2  presents the distribution of the four factors in the total sample and in race and gender subgroups. In this population, all groups scored toward the top of the range on three of the four factors and low on Cost of Religiousness. For example, where the potential range of God Helped was 0–40, the mean score for all groups was ≥34.0, and the interquartile range included the maximum value. The reliability coefficient, Cronbach's alpha, was in most cases ≥0.70, suggesting that a high proportion of the observed variance was due to true differences among individuals in the sample. The two exceptions to this pattern were differences among African American elders on Lifetime Religious Social Support and Cost of Religiousness. Spiritual History, Demographics, and Late Life Religiousness  Table 3  presents differences in demographic and religious subgroup scores on each of the four factors. Racial and socioeconomic differences were pronounced. African American elders scored significantly higher on God Helped, Family History of Religiousness, and Lifetime Religious Social Support than White elders. Elders with no college credit were more likely to score high on God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support than their more educated counterparts, and those with annual incomes ≤$20,000 were more likely to score high on God Helped than more wealthy subjects. Scores on Cost of Religiousness were higher among married than unmarried elders. Age, gender, and urban–rural differences on all factors were trivial.Religious affiliation groups differed significantly in their mean scores on the God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support scales. On the God Helped subscale, fundamentalist/pietistic subjects scored higher than mainline Protestants, and these higher than Roman Catholic and Jewish subjects, and these higher than other subjects. On the Lifetime Religious Social Support subscale, the fundamentalist/pietistic group reported higher mean scores than the other three groups. Mean scores across affiliation groups did not differ on Family History of Religiousness or Cost of Religiousness. Subjects who scored high on religious service attendance or private devotional activity at previous interviews were more likely to score high on God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support, and somewhat more likely to score high on Family History of Religiousness and Cost of Religiousness.The four spiritual history factors were associated with other religion items measured in the current study. When subjects' lifetime religious affiliation had not changed over their lifetime, when they reported that God was involved in their daily lives, and when they engaged regularly in religious practices, subjects tended to report higher scores on God Helped, Family History of Religiousness, and Lifetime Religious Social Support. Cost of Religiousness scores were highest for subjects who reported that someone had influenced their religious life in a negative way and for those reporting at least one religious or spiritual turning point. Spiritual History and Health Status  Table 4  presents relationships between 1996 health status variables and 1996 religious service attendance, first unadjusted and then with the addition of each of the four SHS factors. Health status measures included chronic medical conditions; basic and instrumental ADLs; physical performance; gross mobility; self-rated health; depressive symptoms; use of alcohol and tobacco; instrumental aid received and given; and availability of a confidant. In general, the unadjusted tests were significant and positive for physical health and social support, and significant and negative for health behaviors. In other words, subjects who attended church or synagogue were in better health, were less isolated, and drank and smoked somewhat less than non-attendees. Unadjusted relationships of religious service attendance with self-rated health, depressive symptoms, smoking, and instrumental help received did not reach statistical significance.Net of the often-reported association of service attendance and physical health, God Helped was positively associated with both impaired gross mobility and poor self-rated health. The interpretation of this result is that health deficits are associated with less frequent organizational religion and with a past history of seeking/receiving divine aid. Impaired gross mobility was also positively related with Lifetime Religious Social Support, when controlling for service attendance. In this case, the interaction term between the two variables was significant (p = .0004). At every level of mobility impairment from least (0) to most (3), subjects with the highest Lifetime Religious Social Support scores attended services significantly more often than did subjects with the lowest Lifetime Religious Social Support scores (untabled). The same pattern of interactive effect was evident for impaired instrumental ADLs.The single measure of mental health (depressive symptoms) was negatively but nonsignificantly associated with church attendance. However, Cost of Religiousness explained significant variance in depressive symptoms. Net of church attendance, subjects who endorsed a clinically relevant number of symptoms (Blazer, Burchett, Service, and George 1991   ), as well as those in the subthreshold range, reported significantly higher Cost of Religiousness scores than subjects with few or no depressive symptoms (untabled).Healthy behaviors were associated with both God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support, over and above the protective effects of service attendance. In comparison to subjects with the least lifetime exposure to religious social support, odds of alcohol use were significantly lower for subjects with moderate (odds ratio [OR] = .22, confidence levels [CL] = .10, .47) and high exposure (OR = .05, CL = .22, .01). Odds of smoking were similarly low for these comparison groups, respectively (OR = .13, CL = .04, .38; OR = .02, CL = .04, .01).Subjective social support, measured as the availability of a confidant, was negatively associated with Cost of Religiousness. Regardless of church attendance, subjects with the lowest subjective social support scores had mean Cost of Religiousness scores more than double those of elders with higher subjective social support scores (means: 4.1 vs. 1.6; untabled). Giving instrumental support was strongly associated with late-life service attendance but was unrelated to any dimension of lifetime religious experience. On the other hand, receiving instrumental support was unrelated to late-life service attendance, but was strongly associated with God Helped and History of Religious Social Support. Regardless of current attendance, subjects with more history of religious social support received significantly more instrumental support than did subjects without such history. Spiritual History and Cumulative Lifetime Religiousness As an alternative check on the construct validity and efficiency of Lifetime Religious Social Support and God Helped subscales, we compared them to measures of cumulative lifetime worship-years and devotional-years. These were constructed in a similar manner to pack-years of smoking. Using repeated measures of the frequency of religious service attendance for each decade of the life span, we summed the average attendance for each year and divided the total by 52. For example, an 85-year-old person who attended services twice a week between the ages of 5 and 15 years, never between the ages of 15 and 25 years, and once a week since then, would score 80 worship-years. Devotional-years were based on years of daily devotionals.In this sample, mean worship-years was 67.6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 53–80); mean devotional-years was 37.4 (IQR: 21–51). Lifetime Religious Social Support and worship-years were moderately correlated (Pearson r = .64); God Helped and devotional-years were also moderately correlated (Pearson r = .49). We substituted these two cumulative lifetime measures in the models described above where Lifetime Religious Social Support and God Helped, respectively, were significant predictors of late-life health. In each instance, the cumulative lifetime measure was a less robust predictor than was either Lifetime Religious Social Support or God Helped. Discussion The Spiritual History Scale (SHS-4) is a 23-item, four-dimensional, retrospective summary measure of religious and spiritual practices and attributions over the life course. It was developed in a stratified, random, biracial sample of cognitively intact community-dwelling elders, living in a predominantly Protestant Christian region of the United States. Three subscales (Lifetime Religious Social Support, God Helped, and Cost of Religiousness) added explanatory value to tests of religious attendance effects on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and subjective and instrumental support. Family History of Religiousness, while strongly related to consistency of affiliation over the life course, did not demonstrate significant associations to health status in a population of elders aged 77 years and older. Reliability and Internal Validity Traditional criteria for reliability and internal validity were generally achieved. Evaluations of test–retest reliability of individual items and internal consistency of subscales were favorable. Selection bias was minimized by use of (a) a randomized sample from an established population for epidemiologic research among elders; (b) extensive data on non-respondents; and (c) in-home interviews designed to minimize nonparticipation. Thus, the results are most likely to be valid for older-old African American and White persons who are cognitively intact and living in the urban and rural Piedmont area of North Carolina. Information bias was minimized by use of (a) structured instrumentation, based on systematic grounded theory procedures; (b) trained interviewers; and (c) chronologically separate measures of exposure (religious/spiritual history) and outcome (health status).In spite of efforts to the contrary, misclassification may have occurred. Recall bias could have affected scores on God Helped if chronic illness and functional disability, persisting across the three intervening years, triggered differential recall of divine help-seeking and aid. Similar differential recall might also distort estimates of effect between Lifetime Religious Social Support and availability of a confidant. Such misclassification could have produced an undeterminable exaggeration or underestimation of the effects observed in this study. In general, however, the mixing of exposure and outcome (and the resulting ambiguity in the direction of causal inference between religious/spiritual history and health status) was reduced by using measures of spiritual history exposure from the current study with the prospective measures of health outcomes obtained from a prior interview wave.Construct validity was addressed in several ways. Over the two phases of the current study, constructs relevant to a religious history (e.g., affiliations, practices, and influences) were assessed by means of multiple operations (including a narrative-based, semistructured interview that informed a structured interview) and multiple methods (including repeated measures of frequency, agree–disagree measures, and multiple-choice measures.) We found widespread evidence of convergent validity across measures within the current study. For example, God Helped scores were highest among subjects who reported regular religious practices and the involvement of the divine in their daily lives. God Helped and Lifetime Religious Social Support were moderately correlated with cumulative lifetime years of devotionals and service attendance, respectively. As well, Cost of Religiousness was most prevalent in the presence of a negative religious influence. Analyses of the correspondence between the SHS-4 subscales and lifetime trajectories of religious practice and salience are currently under way.SHS-4 scores were also consonant with, and in some cases extended, the findings from other epidemiologic studies from North Carolina and elsewhere. As would be expected, Lifetime Religious Social Support was strongly correlated with 10-year repeated measures of church attendance, and God Helped was moderately correlated with 10-year repeated measures of private devotional activity from the Duke/EPESE. At the same time, the previous and current measures did not appear to tap equivalent constructs: The correlation coefficients were not so high as to preclude an appropriate divergence between the repeated measures of proximal history and new scales referencing a more comprehensive "lifetime history."Convergence with non-EPESE samples was also evident. First, scores on Family History of Religiousness were dramatically elevated, similar to the frequencies of childhood churchgoing reported in a previous Piedmont North Carolina elderly cohort by Blazer and Palmore 1976   . As in their study, we found early childhood and late-life religious participation remarkably uncorrelated. Second, the observed race differential in religious upbringing, lifetime religious participation, and religious help-seeking/receiving also confirms and extends findings on the religiousness of African American elders, described earlier by Krause 1992    and Chatters and colleagues 1992   . Third, the relationship of Cost of Religiousness to spiritual turning points and negative influences is reminiscent of Zinnbauer and colleagues 1997    work on the antecedents of developing a self-concept as "spiritual but not religious." The availability of this subscale may be particularly useful for testing cohort differences in future studies.Fourth, significant relationships between religious history and health were in a plausible direction. Given recent findings for church attendance and health behaviors (Koenig, George, Meador, Blazer, and Ford 1994   ; Koenig et al. 1997   ; Musick, Blazer, and Hays 2000   ), it was reasonable to expect that cumulative exposure to religious social support would be associated with health behaviors and might be a more significant predictor than late-life organizational religion. Likewise, it was reasonable to expect that lifetime involvement in organizational religion would explain late-life receipt of instrumental support, whereas current church attendance failed to demonstrate such a relationship. Finally, even as late-life church attendance remained inversely related to late-life functional status, as reported by Hays and coworkers 1998   , the accumulated experience—or habit, as it were—of involvement in religious organizations appeared to provide motivation to persist in such activity, even in the face of significant functional impairment. These observations suggest intriguing longitudinal hypotheses about psychosocial mechanisms for future tests using these data (under way) and data from other studies. External Validity The criteria for external validity pose significant challenges to epidemiologists of religion. Measures have different meanings in different subgroups, and this may be especially the case with measures of religious constructs. The SHS-4 was developed among elders who were born in 1922 or earlier and grew up where the majority faith tradition was Christian. Its psychometric properties may vary when used in younger cohorts, where non-Christian faith traditions represent the majority and Christian adherents the minority, or where the distribution of Christian denominations differs. Nevertheless, the sampling strategy deliberately maximized the range of religious affiliation in a sample whose diversity in other regards (e.g., racial and urban–rural) was an asset and whose health status had been extensively and independently characterized. For elders in many regions of the United States and for the foreseeable future, the SHS-4 provides a rigorously developed instrument for measuring lifetime experience of religion and spirituality. Varying the geographical setting, the cultural subgroup, and the age cohort will be critical strategies for evaluating the broader generalizability of the measure. Equally important will be the extension of these findings to clinical groups characterized by greater levels of stress and more extensive requirements for coping. Finally, the SHS-4 could be used to address the long-standing concerns of sociologists and psychologists of religion to describe typical patterns of life-course religious involvement and the nature of spiritual growth and development.

     Abstract Purpose:When compositional differences between age groups are controlled, the bivariate, curvilinear pattern of age differences in voluntary association memberships is replaced by one in which peak membership levels occur in late middle age and remain relatively stable thereafter. We sought to determine if this adjusted pattern persists when widespread memberships in two types of associations are removed: (1) church-related organizations, in which membership increases with age but may be confounded with church membership per se; and (2) labor unions, in which membership is also widespread but may not be "voluntary."Design and Methods:Total memberships in 14 types of associations were examined using aggregated data from 12 national surveys conducted between 1974 and 1994.Results:The familiar curvilinear relationship at the bivariate level appears, but in the multivariate analysis, membership levels rise from ages 18–24 through 55–59 and persist close to that level through ages 85 and older.Implications:The results reaffirm that age differences in voluntary association affiliations are due to age-based compositional differences; they also show, however, that the pattern observed with controls is neither driven by membership in church-related "associations" nor altered when membership in labor unions is excluded.   Formal activities ,  Group memberships ,  Voluntarism Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe frequently asserted belief that older persons do not engage in productive activities is false. In fact, through various forms of voluntary contributions, elders provide a wide range of goods and services to other segments of the population. This research is predicated on a contention that such claims risk mistaking cohort-related characteristics for willingness to contribute and actual contributions. As for older persons themselves, participation in various forms of voluntary association has salutary effects. Activity levels per se and diverse forms of engagement are thought to be supportive of life satisfaction, morale, and even physical functioning. The rewards are seemingly both intrinsic and extrinsic, leading to a preservation of sense of well-being, solidarity, integration, and health (Gecas and Burke 1995   ; Moen 1996   ; Moen, Dempster-McClain, and Williams 1989   , Moen, Dempster-McClain, and Williams 1992   ; Monk 1995   ; Musick, Herzog, and House 1999   ; Pillemer, Moen, Wethington, and Glasgow 2000   ).Because it is widely maintained that both rates and frequency of voluntary association membership build to and then decline after a midlife peak (Fischer and Schaffer 1993   ; Goss 1999   ; Herzog and Morgan 1993   ; Hodgkinson and Weitzman 1996   ; Rotolo 2000   ), our focus is on life-course patterns of voluntary association. Put simply, we assert that no such fall-off occurs and that rates remain relatively stable until age 85 or so. In a recent analysis of a composite National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Surveys (GSS) data set, we mustered evidence to counter the presumed decline in membership among older persons. Our data suggested that the decline is an artifact of compositional differences between cohorts. That is, any late-life declines may be attributable to factors known to differentiate among cohorts in the first place. So, for example, the population of older persons has lower levels of education, poorer health, fewer family ties, and a higher likelihood of being widowed than their younger counterparts. It is exactly these factors that are predictive of lower levels of membership in voluntary associations. The conjunction of cohort factors and rates of voluntary affiliation has led some to assume that older persons are less involved, and perhaps even in the process of disengaging from active life styles. Our findings suggest that when crucial cohort-related compositional factors are taken into account, rates of affiliation increase through the middle years and appear to remain fairly stable into the mid-80s (Cutler and Hendricks 2000   ). Our results are generally consistent with those of the MacArthur Studies on Successful Aging, which suggest there is continuity in later life, with more than 98% of older people who live in private households being engaged in some form of productive activities (Rowe and Kahn 1998   ). It may be that older persons continue their previous patterns of engagement as an adaptive strategy for as long as they are able, certainly into their mid-80s (Atchley 1999   ; Hays et al. 1998   ; Mindel and Vaughan 1978   ). For these and other reasons, groups or organizations charged with delivering services in the face of scarce resources perceive a vast untapped pool of older volunteers (Freedman 1997   ).Those who posit a curvilinear relationship between age and rates of voluntary association with a marked downturn beyond age 65 or so, as well as those who see no such decline, both point out conflating factors not necessarily explained by compositional characteristics. One difficulty is the relative importance of two widespread forms of association: church-related affiliations and union memberships. Putnam 1995    is of the opinion that church-related associations are so pervasive in the United States that those affiliations misrepresent overall voluntary association rates. A similar claim has been made for union memberships; they are important, retained even after retirement, and pervasive enough to distort global patterns (Curtis, Grabb, and Baer 1992   ). Our question is simply: Do these two types of voluntary association exert an influence so ubiquitous that the entire pattern of memberships during the adult years is affected? Importance of Religious and Union Membership as Forms of Voluntary Association Religion-Based Memberships. Rates of religious affiliation are higher in the United States than in most industrialized countries. In their estimate of church memberships in 15 countries, Curtis and associates 1992    ranked the United States first. Overall estimates are that 55% of all Americans are affiliated with church or religious groups, that 50–60% of all voluntary participation occurs within religious organizations, and that among older persons, about 65% identify church or synagogue as a primary focus of volunteer activity (Goss 1999   ; Hodgkinson and Weitzman 1996   ; Independent Sector 1998   ; Van Willigen 2000   ). In fact, "church-affiliated groups may be the backbone of civil society in America, involving almost half of the population" (Galston and Levine 1997   , p. 25; Lipset 1990   ). Greeley 1997    noted that religious-based memberships have an independent effect in explaining overall levels of voluntary association in virtually all 16 countries included in the European Value Studies. Greeley reported that religious affiliation (church attendance and membership in religious groups) accounts for 38% of the variance found across the 16 countries. As he put it, "[t]he American ‘advantage’ in volunteering is patently the result of the higher levels of American religious practice" (Greeley 1997   , p. 72). Whether it is because churches and religion promote a "do-gooder" mindset or a "culture of benevolence" is difficult to say; it may be that one form of participation abets other forms (Goss 1999   ; Musick, Wilson, and Bynum 2000   ; Wilson and Musick 1997   ).In the United States, church affiliations are strong and appear to provide meaningful webs of social relations. In their analysis of the link between church membership and volunteering, Wilson and Janoski 1995    highlighted the complexity of the relationship and discrepancies between denominations. They noted that among Catholics, patterns form early and persist. Among liberal Protestant denominations (those associated with social activism), volunteering does not become part of the pattern or complex of values until midlife. Among conservative Protestants, generalizable patterns are least apparent, and voluntarism is largely limited to church-related activities (Wilson and Janoski 1995   ). Among other subgroups of the population—African American elders, for example—some research suggests that church affiliations are of such salience that they can be used effectively to provide needed services (Hatch 1991   ; Taylor 1986   ). Among older persons, some investigators suggest that religious organizations account for the preponderance of volunteer work and may provide "the most psychologically beneficial type of volunteer work" (Van Willigen 2000   ).Another reason for focusing on church-related groups is that there is conceptual and empirical disagreement about the appropriate boundaries to be employed in delineating membership in this type of voluntary association. On the one hand, Smith 1983    has argued that churches (in the generic sense) are a type of voluntary organization and, therefore, a broad definition encompassing all forms of church membership should be used. On the other hand, most surveys have taken a more limited approach and have asked about membership in church-affiliated or church-related groups. Yet, there is evidence that the ambiguity in the way the question is posed leads to confusion between memberships in church-related groups and church membership per se, with the result that reported membership levels in church-affiliated groups are inflated (Smith 1990   ). It is also not altogether clear what modes of religious activity qualify as church-affiliated groups. Bible study and youth groups would appear to fit the description, but do church choirs or short-term preparatory classes offered prior to a church-sponsored trip to the Holy Land? In short, the need for conceptual clarification provides yet another argument for the exclusion of church-affiliated groups. Union Membership. Union membership has also been a conspicuous form of voluntary association, one that persists into retirement. Curtis and colleagues 1992    found that 13% of respondents in the World Values Survey reported union membership. In the GSS data set used here, 14.7% of respondents who described themselves as "retired" reported belonging to a union as well—the fourth most common form of association membership for all retirees (after church-affiliated, fraternal, and veterans groups) and third highest among male retirees (after church-affiliated and veterans groups). Continuing membership may provide social interaction and recreation, a venue for dealing with pension and benefit issues, and an opportunity to remain involved in programs and activities. According to Galston and Levine 1997   , union members are more likely to participate in other voluntary associations or make charitable contributions than their nonunion counterparts. The hypothesis is that there is a "stepping stone" process—that membership in preexisting voluntary or secondary associations leads to volunteer participation (Lofland 1996   , p. 187; Smith 1994   ; Wilson and Musick 1998   ). Methods Data For this analysis we created a composite data set (N = 18,295) from 12 nationally representative NORC General Social Surveys conducted between 1974 and 1994 (Davis and Smith 1994   ). All surveys in the GSS series (from 1972 to 1998) with the variables to be used in the analysis were selected for inclusion (see  Table 1  for the survey years and initial Ns). Samplings for the 1974 survey and half of the 1975 survey were based on a block quota design; the remaining half of the 1975 survey and all other years used full probability sampling designs. Each sample was representative of the population of English-speaking persons 18 years of age and older living in noninstitutional arrangements in the United States.In addition to the exclusion of respondents with missing data on any of the analysis variables, changes in content coverage over the history of the GSS resulted in a further reduction of the total N for the 12 surveys from 18,295 to 11,789 ( Table 1  ). Several of the variables used in the analysis (age, gender, race, education, employment status, marital status, and presence of children in the household) are part of the series of permanent items asked of all respondents in each survey. Other items have been asked on a rotational basis to allow for an expanded number of topics. Through 1987, rotating items were included in two of three surveys. Beginning with the 1988 survey, the rotational system switched to one in which selected items were asked of two thirds of the respondents within each survey. Information about both voluntary association memberships and self-perceived health was sought from all respondents in the first six surveys listed in  Table 1  . From 1988 through 1994, however, these items were asked only of partially overlapping subsets of two thirds of the samples, with the effect that information on both association memberships and health was obtained from about one third of the respondents in these years.Although the final number of cases was considerably greater than is usually available for analyses of voluntary association membership, we tested for possible biases stemming from the elimination of cases by comparing the race, gender, and education distributions for the full sample and the analysis sample and found negligible differences (see Cutler and Hendricks 2000   ). Bias stemming from loss of cases, then, does not appear to be a significant issue. Variables To assess rates of membership in any of 16 possible types of formal voluntary associations, we relied on the question, "Now we would like to know something about the groups or organizations to which individuals belong. Here is a list of various organizations. Could you tell me whether or not you are a member of each type?" Respondents were then read a list that comprised fraternal groups; service clubs; veterans groups; political clubs; labor unions; sports groups; youth groups; school service groups; hobby or garden clubs; school fraternities or sororities; nationality groups; farm organizations; literary, art, discussion, or study groups; professional or academic societies; church-affiliated groups; and any other groups. Adopting the methodology used by Rotolo 1999    and others, we obtained total counts of memberships (corrected for a coding error for the years 1989–1994 [Helliwell and Putnam 1996   ]), with potential scores ranging from 0 to 16 (with church-affiliated groups and labor unions included) and 0 to 14 (with memberships in these two types of associations excluded). If anything, this approach underestimates total rates of affiliation as it depends on a count of types rather than actual organizational memberships (Baumgartner and Walker 1988   ).We recoded age into 5-year intervals, beginning with 18–24, 25–29, and ranging up to 80–84 and 85+. Previous work (see Cutler and Hendricks 2000   , for a summary) has shown that higher membership rates are found among men and Whites; among those in better health and with higher levels of education; and among persons who are employed, married, or have children residing in the household. Because distributional differences by age in these variables will have the effect of dampening membership rates of the older age groups, we controlled for gender, self-perceived health (excellent, good, fair, poor), education (0–8 years, 9–11 years, high school graduate, some college, college graduate or more), work status (full-time, part-time, unemployed, retired, other), marital status (married, widowed, divorced/separated, never married), presence of children in the household (yes, no), and race (White, non-White). Analysis The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the adjusted pattern of increasing voluntary association membership rates through age 50–54, and high and generally stable rates thereafter, is due to affiliations with church-related groups and labor unions. To address this question, we used Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA; SPSS for Windows, Release 7.5; Andrews, Morgan, and Sonquist 1967   ), a multivariate procedure that enabled us to examine the bivariate effect of age on number of memberships, as well as its impact on our dependent variables after adjusting for the effects of the controls. MCA is particularly well suited to the objectives of this analysis in that no assumption of linearity was required, and we were able to obtain both bivariate (gross) and adjusted (net) mean membership scores for each of the 14 age categories in order to examine age patterns of membership. Eta and beta coefficients can be used to evaluate strength of the relationships at the bivariate and multivariate levels, and F tests are available to determine whether any given predictor (i.e., age) explains a significant proportion of the variance in the dependent variable before and after other predictors are held constant. Results Our discussion of the results of the analysis is divided into four sections. First, we briefly summarize support for using the composite of the 12 surveys. Second, we also briefly note the bivariate and multivariate age differences in association memberships when all 16 types are considered. Third, we consider whether these latter findings are altered when memberships in church-affiliated groups and in labor unions are excluded. Finally, we summarize the effects of the control variables.In an effort to determine if period effects were influencing the composite pattern, our first step was to determine whether it was appropriate to aggregate the 12 surveys over the 20-year period. Based on an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis examining the effects on number of memberships of survey year, age, age2, and an interaction term for age2 and survey year, we found that neither survey year nor the age2/survey year interaction was significant (see Cutler and Hendricks 2000   ). From these results, we concluded that the nature of the relationship between age and number of memberships did not vary during the period in question, thus justifying the aggregation of the 12 surveys in order to have as large a number of cases as possible at the oldest ages.In looking to overall number of associations in which respondents claimed affiliation for the full set of 16 types, we found that memberships did appear to follow a curvilinear pattern by age when viewed in bivariate relationship ( Table 2  ). The gross mean number of memberships was low among the youngest respondents, rose steadily to a peak at ages 40–44, and then declined through ages 85+, where the lowest average number of memberships was found. On the face of it, this might be taken to confirm the belief that there is a decline in affiliations during the retirement years. However, we then controlled for compositional effects and found a somewhat different pattern. Examination of the net mean scores for the full set of 16 types of associations showed that memberships rise from ages 25–29 and peak at ages 55–59, after which there is a long plateau, lasting until ages 85+. Because the number of respondents at even more advanced ages became so small at that point, we were unable to make any comments about what then occurs. For a more complete discussion of the results for all 16 types, see Cutler and Hendricks 2000   .Because our primary interest in this analysis is in the effects of church-based and union memberships, we first excluded one, then the other, and then both. The principal conclusion was the same regardless of whether the analysis was based on 15 types of memberships (with church-affiliated groups or labor unions excluded) or 14 types (with church-affiliated groups and labor unions excluded), so only the latter results are presented here.First, examination of the unadjusted (gross) mean number of memberships in the 14 types of associations showed the now familiar curvilinear pattern of age differences ( Table 2  ). The highest level of affiliation occurred among persons 40–44 years of age. Membership levels trailed off steadily on both sides of this age group, with the lowest average number of memberships found among the 85+ age group.Again, however, it must be recalled that characteristics of older persons are differentially distributed along the control variables. As detailed in Cutler and Hendricks 2000   , older persons were significantly more likely to report their health as poor, have lower levels of education, and be out of the labor force. The older age groups also have higher percentages of women, widows, persons living in households without children, and at ages 85+ non-Whites. These very same characteristics dampen levels of association affiliation. The net means for the 14 types of associations yielded the pattern of age differences after the effects of the varying compositional characteristics were controlled. This pattern proved to be quite similar to what we previously found for the 16 types. Although there was an initial decline between the ages of 18–24 and 25–29, number of affiliations rose thereafter through ages 55–59, dropped slightly at ages 60–64, and then remained relatively stable through ages 85+. Even with the deletion of membership in church-related groups and labor unions, the net mean scores clearly indicate that a major source of the lower levels of association membership observed in the bivariate data among the older age groups stemmed from their compositional characteristics.To provide a rough approximation of the significance of the changes from the unadjusted to the adjusted mean scores for each age group, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for each of the gross mean scores. The 95% CIs were used under the assumption that whether an age group's net mean falls within or outside the interval for its gross mean can be taken as an approximate indication of the significance of the change when compositional differences are controlled. The results (not presented here) provided further support for our conclusions. Specifically, for the analysis of both the 16 types and the 14 types of associations, the adjusted means fell within the 95% CIs for three of the age groups: 18–24, 45–49, and 50–54. In these instances, the adjustment process made little difference. For each of the remaining age groups, their net mean scores lay outside of the gross mean's confidence interval, suggesting that controlling for compositional characteristics appears to have had an appreciable effect.As a way of summing up this part of the findings, the net means reported in  Table 2  for both the 16-type analysis and the 14-type analysis are presented in  Fig. 1 . Apart from average membership levels for the analysis of 14 types of associations being consistently but unsurprisingly lower for each age group than was the case with the analysis based on 16 types, the age-based membership curves are quite alike. Both show a decline in average number of memberships between the ages of 18–24 and 25–29, increasing levels through ages 55–59, a decrease from 55–59 to 60–64, and a relatively constant number of memberships through the 85+ age group. That the curve for the 14 types of associations appears to be flatter is supported by the respective betas (.164 for the 16 types and .106 for the 14 types), but both patterns are statistically significant by the F test for net effects (see  Table 2  ).  Fig. 1  also suggests that the exclusion of membership in church-related groups and in labor unions makes less difference at the younger ages, leads to a widening gap up through ages 55–59, and then to a constant difference thereafter. This impression is supported by the data in the far right column of  Table 2  , which presents the simple differences between the net mean scores for the analysis based on 16 types and that based on 14 types. Generally, the magnitude of the differences increased up through age late 50s and then remained fairly steady, at least through the 80–84 age group. In other words, excluding church-related organizations and labor unions lowered the membership count of all age groups but had the least impact on membership levels of younger persons, a growing impact on overall affiliation rates up to the late middle-age period of the life course, and a uniform impact thereafter.Finally, of the control variables, education exerted the strongest net effect (Beta = .368), that is, the higher the level of educational attainment, the greater the number of memberships. Respondents with children in the household belonged to more associations than those without children (Beta = .060), men had a greater number of memberships than women (Beta = .059), membership levels were higher the better one's self-reported health (Beta = .049), and Whites had a higher number of affiliations than non-Whites (Beta = .043). For work status, the unemployed had the lowest number of memberships, part-time workers the highest, and full-time workers, retirees, and other statuses were intermediate (Beta = .037). Widowed respondents had fewer memberships than persons who were married, divorced/separated, or never married (Beta = .023). All relationships between the control variables and number of association memberships were significant beyond at least the .01 level. Discussion About half of all Americans are currently engaged in some form of volunteer activity, including voluntary associations (Hodgkinson and Weitzman 1996   ; Sundeen 1992   ; Van Willigen 2000   ). Yet, in recent years, some (Putnam 1995   , Putnam 2000   ; Rotolo 1999   ) have asserted that rates are waning overall or for particular forms of participation. As far as older volunteers are concerned, some investigators point to overarching patterns of decline, whereas others report that with increases in life expectancy have come intensified searches for meaningful, perhaps even altruistic endeavors. Paradoxically, at the same time, volunteering is "marketed" as a valuable activity, a way to make a difference in deserving causes. In fact, a monitoring group, Independent Sector 1998   , asserted that in 1995, $77.2 billion worth of voluntary services were contributed by older volunteers. Moreover, the number of nonprofit associations listed in the Encyclopedia of Associations was more than twice as great as it had been less than 30 years previously (Allard and Gruber 1998   –99). As if any further evidence were needed, a spate of new popular books provides ample testimony that volunteering is alive and well. As far as older persons are concerned, rather than withdrawing from active participation, older persons seek and provide "pay back" through voluntary participation of one form or another (Cohen 2000   ; Freedman 2000   ; Roszak 1998   ).Our data lead us to assert that voluntary association membership rises to a peak in ages 55–59 and remains reasonably stable until age 85, religious and/or union affiliations notwithstanding. Although our findings are contrary to what some have maintained (e.g., Fischer, Rapkin, and Rappaport 1991   ; Greeley 1997   ), we did not find that church-affiliated memberships or union memberships accounted for the stable pattern of membership (e.g., Lofland 1996   ; Wilson and Musick 1998   ).To reach that conclusion, we aggregated data on various types of association membership among 16 types of associations over the 20-year period from 1974 to 1994 as collected in 12 national GSS surveys. Had we looked merely at the bivariate relationship between age and number of memberships, there would indeed have appeared to be a marked curvilinear relationship with a long, slow tapering off in the later years. However, from a multivariate perspective, the relationship was positive through ages 55–59 and, after a slight drop, continued pretty much as a plateau until the respondents were in the 85+ category. Further, membership in neither church-related associations nor unions appeared to exert a significant influence on the overall pattern.One of the implications of our findings is that an extensive pool of volunteers is found among older segments of the population, and that they continue to be engaged to the extent that their stamina and vigor permit throughout the life course. In several respects, they are more engaged than many of their younger counterparts. Until their mid-80s, many older persons appear to remain involved. As has frequently been pointed out (Atchley 1999   ; Freedman 1997   ), older adults often search for options that may help them perceive themselves as both engaged in and contributing to some greater good. Our data imply that this is the case, as even when church affiliations and union memberships are controlled, high rates of voluntary association memberships persist well into the later years.These results, of course, are based on an analysis of the number of types of voluntary associations to which people belong. As noted earlier, this approach likely underestimates the actual number of affiliations, given that persons may belong to more than one association within each type (Baumgartner and Walker 1988   ). More definitive estimates would require an enumeration of memberships within each of these general types. Memberships themselves also represent just one form of participation in voluntary associations. Further research on age differences should examine various modes and levels of involvement and activity. Finally, participation in the types of formal, voluntary associations considered in this study does not exhaust the range of ways in which voluntaristic contributions can be made. Only by casting the widest possible net of types of voluntaristic activities will we be able to fully appreciate the scope and magnitude of productive activities in the later years.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: We propose national standards previously recommended for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program by an Institute of Medicine program evaluation committee, and introduce a tool to measure the compliance of local ombudsman programs to those standards: the Huber Badrak Borders Scales. Methods: The best practices for ombudsman programs detailed in the committee's report were adapted to 43 Likert-type scales that were then averaged into 10 infrastructure component scales: (a) program structure, (b) qualifications of local ombudsmen, (c) legal authority, (d) financial resources, (e) management information systems, (f) legal resources, (g) human resources, (h) resident advocacy services, (i) systemic advocacy, and (j) educational services. The scales were pilot-tested in 1996 and 1999 with Kentucky ombudsmen. Results: The means of 9 of these 10 scales were higher in 1999 than in 1996, suggesting that local ombudsman programs were more in compliance with the proposed standards in 1999 than three years earlier. Implications: The development process consisted of 10 adopt-test-revise-retest steps that can be replicated by other types of programs to develop program compliance tools.   Administration ,  Best practice ,  Evaluation ,  Implementation Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDBest-practice standards were recommended by the committee convened by the Institute of Medicine in October 1993 (IoM; Harris-Wehling, Feasley, and Estes 1995   ) to evaluate the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program (LTCOP). The purposes of this article are (a) to describe the process of developing ombudsman program standards based on the IoM Committee's guidelines, and (b) to introduce a tool developed to assess compliance of local programs to these national standards. Background The LTCOP began in 1971. Today, local ombudsmen in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico identify, investigate, and work to resolve complaints initiated by, or on behalf of, residents in nursing homes, board- and care-homes, or similar adult care facilities (Administration on Aging [AoA], 1996). Although the program is federally mandated in the Older Americans Act, it is managed on the state level, resulting in a multitude of program designs (Cherry 1991   ). In 1997, 887 paid staff and 6,795 certified volunteer ombudsmen opened 130,709 cases and closed 113,027 cases that involved 191,005 complaints (AoA, 2000).Researchers have studied the LTCOP since the early 1980s (Cherry 1991   ; Huber, Netting, and Paton 1993   ; Monk, Kaye, and Litwin 1984   ; Nelson 1995   ; Nelson, Huber, and Walter 1995   ). Particular attention has been paid to the reporting system that ombudsmen use to track complaints (Chelimsky, 1991; Huber 1994   ; Netting, Huber, and Kautz 1995   ; Netting, Paton, and Huber 1992   ; Paton, Huber, and Netting 1994   ). Seeking to address concerns raised by ombudsmen and researchers, AoA implemented the National Ombudsman Reporting System (NORS) in 1995. NORS has made it possible to analyze program outputs and outcomes and to even conduct cross-state comparisons (AoA, 2000; Huber, Borders, Netting, and Kautz 2000   ).NORS is a comprehensive program evaluation tool to track complaint patterns and trends in the facilities monitored by ombudsmen, not to answer questions about quality of program implementation. Now that NORS is developed, the next step in a fully developed performance evaluation system is to focus on program quality (Grinnell 1997   ). The Development of National Standards The adoption of national standards from the work of experts is not a new concept (Brennan and Kaplan 1993   ; Flaherty 1999   ; Nash, Markson, Howell, and Hildreth 1993   ). Propst 1992    noted that such standards answer questions about program philosophies and purposes. Beyea and Nicoll 1999    noted that "voluntary standards are those developed by… practitioners and often are the work of a professional organization" (p. 495). Moxley 1993    described five uses for clubhouse standards to address value-based intrinsic qualities of the program, asserting that "the standards are a living document, subject to modification every 2 years…" (p. 178). Clubhouse programs serve mentally ill clients (members).Some disciplines are prolific in the development of guidelines and standards. For example, McKinnon and colleagues 1999    proposed minimum requirements for home care pharmacies, and Walker, Howard, Walker, Lambert, and Suchinsky 1995    described the burgeoning guidelines for addictions programs (Book et al. 1996   ; Kelly and Toepp 1992   ). Other medical specialties have also developed numerous guidelines for physicians (Fiester 1978   ); child and adolescent psychiatry (Bernet 1999   ); surgical nursing (Ide and Fleming 1999   ); school psychology (Batsche, Knoff, and Peterson 1989   ); and social work (Howard and Jenson 1999   ; Wambach, Haynes, and White 1999   ). Lichtenberg and colleagues 1998    proposed psychological standards for practice in long-term care facilities, and Myers 1992    spoke of competencies for gerontological counselors. More recently, Harrington and coworkers 2000    found that experts had recommended minimum nurse staffing standards for U.S. nursing facilities. Developing national standards is not limited to the United States (e.g., Bagshaw 1999   ; Beecham 1999   ; Bell 1996   ; Ogloff and Oley 1998   ; McIvor 1994   ; Mitchell, Harvey, and Rolls 1998   ). Ombudsman Standards The Institute of Medicine (IoM) was commissioned by AoA to study the ombudsman program (Harris-Wehling et al. 1995   ). Chaired by Dr. Carroll Estes, the committee consisted of 16 leading gerontologists: Carroll L. Estes, Chair; Janice M. Caldwell, Donald L. Custis, Worth B. Daniels, Jr., Rebecca D. Elon, Christine Gianopoulos, Elma L. Holder, Rosalie A. Kane, Vivian Omagbemi, Mary D. Poole, Joanne Rader, Charles P. Sabatino, Jeanne V. Sanders, Peter W. Shaughnessy, John H. Skinner, and Hollis G. Turnham. Their valuable work provided the guidelines from which we have worked. One of the IoM committee's recommendations was to "… build upon the committee's proposed set of exemplary, essential, and unacceptable practices to develop and implement an objective method to assess compliance of state long-term care ombudsman programs" (Harris-Wehling et al. 1995   , p. 155). Our goal is to fulfill this recommendation—to further refine these practices into a tool to be used in assessing compliance.In a best-practices format, the committee presented a series of tables to which one could look for quality program characteristics. We propose that these tables be conceptualized as the basis for national standards against which ombudsman programs can be assessed for compliance. The main components are shown in  Fig. 1 . Unacceptable practices are those that do not conform to the objectives of the Older Americans Act. Essential practices refer to the basic minimum requirements for programs, and Exemplary practices are those seen in the most successful ombudsman programs—perhaps a small percentage.We need to be very clear that the development of the assessment tool introduced here was derived from the work of Dr. Estes' committee and the IoM staff (Harris-Wehling et al. 1995   ; see an excerpt of Table 5 in the  Table A1  1). The presence (or not) and strengths of program qualities identified by IoM are reflected in the Huber Badrak Borders Scales, a tool introduced here to assess the extent to which local ombudsman programs comply with national standards. Development of the Huber Badrak Borders Scales It is important to first place this instrument in both political and programmatic contexts. Politically, the results of efforts to assess quality programming can be used for unintended purposes, and they may be ignored if they do not support popular beliefs (Quinn and Magill 1994   ). Similarly, it is difficult to fully develop and use a compliance assessment tool in environments in which the results can be used in ways that can affect ombudsmen's careers and agency reputations. It is critical that data be used within the context of their purposes (Huber et al. 2000   ). On the other hand, it is necessary to place the instrument in the overall context of program implementation and the critical need to evaluate those elements necessary for quality service delivery. Before outputs and outcomes can emerge, programs must have appropriate infrastructures, and infrastructures are likely to change in social programs.Armed with the IoM report, the first and third authors met at a national conference in Fall 1995 and drafted a program assessment tool based on the seminal Table 5 in the IoM report (see excerpt in the  Table A1  1). We worked from only the items in IoM's Table 5 that pertain to local ombudsman programs (similar work is beginning on scales for the practices of the offices of state long-term care ombudsmen). The assumption behind IoM's Table 5 is that quality programs will provide better services to clients than programs whose practice characteristics are either unacceptable or minimal (only the bare essential elements in place). We therefore propose that this best-practice model be adopted as a set of national standards for local and state ombudsman programs.To transform the standards into a quantifiable format, many hours were spent with ombudsmen at all levels of the Kentucky program: local and regional (Western, Central, and Eastern Kentucky) within the state, and the Kentucky State Ombudsman. Ten steps were taken in the development process: (a) the initial work of the first and third authors; (b) revisions by the Kentucky State Ombudsman; (c) review by Kentucky's regional and local ombudsmen; (d) another revision based on their input; (e) pilot implementation in 1996; (f) results of the pilot study presented to and discussed with Kentucky ombudsmen at all levels; (g) second review by Kentucky's regional and local ombudsmen; (h) synthesis of input by researchers in consultation with state and regional ombudsmen; (i) a second implementation in 1999; and (j) presentation of results to all Kentucky ombudsmen.We conceptualized IoM's range of practices on a reverse continuum from that shown in IoM's Table 5. Notice that the excerpt from IoM's Table 5 in the  Table A1  1 shows Exemplary practices on the left of the table, Essential in the middle, and Unacceptable on the right. We kept the basic content (albeit revised many times) but conceptualized it on a 1–10 continuum, where 1 is the lowest rating (on the left) and 10 is the highest (on the right). The 1–10 scales are overlaid with IoM's three levels of practice characteristics: Unacceptable (ratings 1, 2, or 3 on the scales), Essential (4, 5, 6, 7), and Exemplary (8, 9, 10). Similarly, we adapted each of IoM's Table 5 sections, (e.g., 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) into a scale with several 1–10 subscales. For example, IoM's Table 5.2, Structure of the Office of the State LTC Ombudsman and Elements of the Host Agency(s) for the State and Local Entities, became Structure of Local Ombudsman Programs in the Huber Badrak Borders Scales, and contains the following four 1–10 subscales: (a) working relationships; (b) fit of host agency; (c) autonomy; and (d) resources.  Table 1  shows the complete structure of the Huber Badrak Borders Scales. The Instrument. The Huber Badrak Borders Scales have been implemented on two different occasions in Kentucky, 1996 and 1999. Feedback in 1996 revealed problems with both the form and its implementation, which we subsequently corrected. Now the three quality areas are defined more concretely: (a) ratings in the Unacceptable range suggest that the program either does not have the desired characteristic or capability at all, or has it in a minimal and ineffective manner; (b) ratings in the Essential range indicate that the local ombudsman program has the essence of that element, but may lack the freedom or skills to use it to the fullest extent; and (c) ratings in the Exemplary range mean that the program not only enjoys the freedom or resources in the element, but that ombudsmen capitalize on that strength to better serve their clients (Gary Hammonds, personal communication, September 19, 1995). See  Fig. 2 .Revisions focused on consistency across the three program levels to be sure, for example, that the same constructs were being compared across program levels (Unacceptable, Essential, and Exemplary). This required several revisions, as the initial characteristics in IoM's Table 5 did not always meet this criterion. Implementation. Several ombudsmen had difficulty distinguishing between using the instrument to evaluate their local programs versus seeing the instrument as a tool for personal performance evaluation. While this is a natural reaction and understandable, the unit of analysis is the program, not the local ombudsman. Local ombudsmen can affect some of the elements, but others may not fall under their influence. For example, an ombudsman in a program located in a Legal Services for the Elderly organization may have on-call access to an attorney, whereas ombudsmen in Area Agencies on Aging may not have direct access to attorneys.Because of fluctuating personnel in Kentucky, the pilot implementation of the instrument in 1996 was not conducted in a consistent format across the state's 15 local programs. During revision meetings, consistent procedures for implementation were also agreed upon: Both the local ombudsmen and their regional supervisors (for the Western, Central, and Eastern parts of the state) completed the document for individual programs. Then local ombudsmen met with their regional ombudsmen to compare their ratings and arrive at decisions about the rating for each of the 43 1–10 subscales. The range of numbers within each program level (Unacceptable 1-2-3; Essential 4-5-6-7; and Exemplary 8-9-10) accommodates progress, even though local host agency restrictions or limited resources, for example, may prohibit a higher rating. The word "improvement" is not used in the 1–10 scales. Movement on the scales over time demonstrates progress or lack thereof, and the instrument can be implemented on a regular basis, for example, once or twice a year to build a growth history (or absence thereof) for each local program. Discussion  Fig. 3  shows only the means of the 10 major scales for Kentucky's local ombudsman programs from the 1996 and 1999 implementations. In all of these scales except one, the means for 1999 were higher, indicating progress. The one scale where the mean for 1999 was not higher is on the Qualifications of the Ombudsman scale. The explanation given by the ombudsmen was that in 1999 they had a better sense of how to rate themselves on this scale. At first glance, this scale can be interpreted as a rating of their own effectiveness as ombudsmen. Interpreted this way, there could be a temptation for ombudsmen to score themselves higher. However, three of the eight subscales are about the restraints or lack of restraints placed upon ombudsmen in performing their duties: Long-Term Care Ties and Regulatory Ties (both of which suggest conflicts of interest), and Adult Protective Service and Guardianship Issues. Unacceptable scores on these subscales are not a reflection of the ombudsman's work, but could result from bureaucratic restrictions. Low ratings on these scales could give the state ombudsmen information about the program that could then be used to strengthen program support.We repeatedly reinforced the idea with ombudsmen that the tool does not necessarily reflect good or poor work of ombudsmen themselves. An ombudsman might be the most efficient and effective ombudsman in the state and still have low ratings on several scales if they are in restrictive host settings. The largest local program in the state, for instance, is organizationally free-standing and, therefore, has complete freedom to raise additional funds and allocate them at will. Unrestricted by answering to a host agency, this program can recruit and even pay stipends to "volunteers" to monitor care in nursing homes. Other local programs, however, are severely restricted in fundraising, volunteer recruitment, community education, and training activities.For the data to be useful, ombudsmen must strive for absolute honesty in their assessments. Local ombudsmen rating their own programs on the Huber Badrak Borders Scales are faced with some dilemmas. There may be a temptation to rate one's own program rather high on the scales to look good. On the other hand, if the final, collaborative ratings are high, there are two potential problems: (a) it is hard to show progress toward higher ratings over time if the original ratings are inflated, and (b) the ombudsman may lose documentation or evidence for grant writing and advocacy purposes if a positive response bias occurs. For example, one scale pertains to ombudsmen's knowledge of regulatory policies and procedures (i.e., licensing, surveys, Medicaid, and rate setting). If this rating is inflated, the opportunity to secure a grant for training may be lost. Conversely, if this rating is low, the ombudsman has a bit of empirical data on which to base a request for training monies. A grant request could, hypothetically, contain language such as: This ombudsman program has consistently earned the lowest ratings in the state on regulatory and guardianship expertise. Therefore, funds for training are central to the integrity of the program. The IoM committee, however, found that both "state and local ombudsmen were willing to acknowledge openly the weaknesses of their programs" (Harris-Wehling et al. 1995   , p. 88). The same is true of Kentucky ombudsmen, and we believe that their programmatic assessments are quite candid.Another subscale pertains to personal liability, where Unacceptable means that under state law ombudsmen have no protection from the state against liability for the good faith performance of their duties. This is the case in Kentucky; therefore, local ombudsmen in the Commonwealth cannot rate themselves anywhere but in the Unacceptable range on this item. The Kentucky State Ombudsman could take charts to the legislature to show areas of growth and progress within the program, but also the huge deficit in the liability area, advocating for liability coverage for local ombudsmen. If the Huber Badrak Borders Scales are implemented in other states, state ombudsmen could also demonstrate differences in this area between the Kentucky ombudsman program and those in other states. Another major problem identified by IoM's committee pertains to conflicts of interest. Data that show the extent to which this is a problem in local programs could lead to policies and structural changes needed to eliminate this ethical quagmire.The purpose of the Huber Badrak Borders Scales is not to measure outcomes, but to assess a program's compliance with national standards. In fact, it cannot be a consistent outcome measure if it is to be a living, dynamic instrument (Moxley 1993   ; Probst, 1992) that grows as program constituencies shift, or as political climates change. We have resisted the researcher's urge to conduct sophisticated analyses, (e.g., factor analysis that could totally reshape the instrument for use as an outcome instrument). To do so would violate the tool's basic/foundation purpose: to assess the extent to which local programs are in compliance with national standards. While it would be a methodological benefit for the Huber Badrak Borders Scales to be implemented intact in several states for comparisons, it may need to be tailored for each state to be the most useful. Conclusion The Huber Badrak Borders Scales can be seen as meeting IoM's recommendation 5.2 to "… develop and implement an objective method to assess compliance of state long-term care ombudsman programs" (Harris-Wehling et al. 1995   , p. 154). Similar instruments can be developed for any program pertaining to any social service problem or population. Recall that this research team did not develop the basic content of the tool, but rather extracted and restructured the comprehensive work of the IoM committee. A next step is for the instrument to be used in other ombudsman programs across the country. Even if other programs choose not to use the tool, it is hoped that debate and discussion about how to assess program compliance with national standards will continue. Additional implementation will also make possible more extensive analysis of other program differences. For example, compliance with the standards can be analyzed by whether programs are hosted by Area Agencies on Aging, a controversial issue among ombudsmen (Huber, Netting, and Kautz 1996   ).Program evaluation of the ombudsman program can be difficult to conduct because the ombudsman's world is not static. The Huber Badrak Borders Scales demonstrate the adaptation of the recommendations of a national committee into an assessment tool useful at the local level, recognizing that program quality is critically important in a rapidly changing environment. The IoM committee provided the framework for national standards and the Huber Badrak Borders Scales assesses compliance with them. It is now up to state and local programs to determine their usefulness for quality practice.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The increasing demand for geriatric home-based care makes it timely to examine how the existing system can become most effective and efficient in promoting the functional outcomes of older patients. Design and Methods: A multidisciplinary work group identified home care agency policies, misconceptions of older adults and their caregivers, and practice patterns of nurses, therapists, and home health aides that can impede patients' progress toward functional independence. This article describes the process that one home care agency used to remove these obstacles. Results and Implications: The work group developed and implemented a restorative model of care that integrates the medical treatments for acute disease processes and the personal care and rehabilitative interventions directed toward chronic disabilities, to improve the functional outcomes of older adults receiving home care.   Coordinated care ,  Functional outcomes ,  Patient goals Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDHome health is the most rapidly expanding segment of U.S. health care. Its growth has been fueled by (a) increasing longevity, with more frail, older persons living at home (Haupt 1998   ); (b) the introduction of the hospital Prospective Payment System, resulting in more older patients discharged home in an early stage of recovery (Haupt 1998   ); and (c) financial incentives that Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) regulations have created for care providers (Bishop, Kerwin, and Wallack 1999   ; Medicare Home Health Agencies 1998   ). Little attention, however, has focused on the optimal structure, process, and outcomes for home health services (Welch, Wennberg, and Welch 1996   ). Instead, home care has been defined by reimbursement policies that direct the provision of clinical care. Medicare covers services to treat acute conditions, but other funding sources are needed for visits to manage chronic illness (Vladeck and Miller 1994   ).Direct care providers can inadvertently be working at cross purposes in their efforts to simultaneously manage disease, provide personal care, and rehabilitate older adults while trying to comply with regulations regarding which funder pays for which visits. Without careful communication, providers can find themselves giving conflicting advice to older patients. We identified this as a widespread problem while working with patients in 27 home care agencies in a home-based rehabilitation clinical trial designed to help participants gain independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) through behavioral or environmental changes (Tinetti et al. 1999   ). For example, a nurse might assign a home health aide (HHA) to bathe and dress an older woman post stroke at the same time as the rehabilitation therapists are encouraging her to build endurance and regain independence by performing those self-care tasks. Some patients did not want to perform their own ADLs for fear of losing their HHAs; others stated they would start learning self-care only when HHA care was ending (Tinetti et al. 1997   ). These attitudes and behaviors proved counterproductive to effective and efficient rehabilitation.The HCFA recently implemented the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for prospective Medicare reimbursement of home care. This system quantifies the effect of home care by comparing patients' baseline and discharge functional abilities (Shaughnessy et al. 1994   ). Yet, the experiences described above and those of other researchers suggest that home care has not focused on altering functional outcomes (Penrod, Kane, Finch, and Kane 1998   ; Weissert 1988   ). This article describes the development of a restorative model of home care designed to integrate medical treatments for acute conditions with personal care and rehabilitation for chronic disabilities in order to improve older adults' functional outcomes. Methods To develop this model we chose a demonstration site at a geographically distinct branch of a typical nonprofit home care agency (HCA). The agency is the oldest and largest in the state, averaging 800 employees who serve more than 12,000 patients a year, 75% of whom are aged 65 years or older. A multidisciplinary work group, experienced in home care, comprised the principal investigator (PhD, RN), a research physical therapist (PT), and HCA staff (2 RNs and 2 PTs). The group initially scheduled weekly meetings, lasting an average of 1.5 hours, but during the 18-month development and implementation process the meetings tapered to monthly. As needed, the work group expanded to include two HHAs experienced in working with older adults. To include consumer opinion, regular attendees at the area senior center, including the center director, a senior social worker, and seven community-dwelling older persons, four of whom had received home care services, were invited and volunteered to participate in a focus group. All work group participants were asked to share insights on how HCA staff might be more effective and efficient in helping older adults achieve functional goals.To facilitate eventual implementation of our model we periodically met with HCA supervisors and administrators for their suggestions and to keep them updated regarding our plans. To prepare for any reactions from patients or families perceiving a change in practice, we also met with staff who monitor patient satisfaction. They explained that most patient complaints involved scheduling—rarely staff skills or care—but that patients are sensitive to behaviors they interpret as impersonal. We requested that any patient complaints that could possibly be a result of project activities be brought to the attention of work group members.Testing followed the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles suggested by Berwick 1998    wherein small, local, short-cycle changes in clinical practice are observed and adjustments made as data and experience accumulate. We followed four steps to develop and test the restorative care model: (1) operationalize the concept of assessing and maximizing functional independence within episodes of home care; (2) identify structural, process, and attitudinal barriers that impede maximizing functional independence; (3) identify and test solutions to these barriers; and (4) implement and test the model with all staff in a designated branch of the HCA. Results Operationalizing Assessment and Maximization of Function The HCA nurses identified "managing disease" as the traditional goal of nursing services and reported they did not specifically focus their interventions on achieving functional independence. A new paradigm for thinking about home care goals emerged, with disease management viewed as essential, but as an intermediate outcome in a course of care aimed at optimizing functional abilities ( Table 1  ). The work group recognized that we did not have a system for objectively assessing and quantifying the type and amount of assistance required for ADLs. The OASIS tool was not sensitive to tracking the incremental changes in ADL abilities. For example, unless patients bathe in the tub or shower unassisted, OASIS does not classify them as independent in bathing—even if they progress from a bed bath to a pattern of safely and effectively sponge bathing at the sink. Protocols developed for a rehabilitation trial, in which each ADL is divided into specific, observable subtasks (described in Tinetti et al. 1997   ), were adapted by the HCA staff to create the Self-care Progress Report (see  Table A1  1). It includes the items tracked by OASIS and (a) records recent (previous 2–4 weeks) and admission functional abilities; (b) tracks the evolving subtasks of each ADL for which the patient needs assistance; and (c) identifies who will provide each type of assistance, including that of non-HCA caregivers. The Self-care Progress Report is started at the time of admission and left in the home as a means of communicating one consistent plan of care among the patient, home care staff, and any other caregivers. Identifying Barriers to Functional Independence The exploration of traditional home care routines revealed barriers posed by the home care staff and system and by older patients and their caregivers ( Table 2  ). Most episodes of care are susceptible to an imbalance between the amount of care required to stimulate—versus suppress—independent function. Further, home care staff are challenged to manage increasingly sicker and older patients, whereas "paperwork" and communication with payers and other providers take an ever increasing amount of time.Review of difficult cases also revealed that some HCA staff lacked experience with frail older people. In some cases goals were set too low, but in others progress was expected to occur faster than feasible. Patient noncompliance resulted when teaching methods, such as giving complicated verbal instructions without leaving written step-by-step instructions, ignored sensory and cognitive changes common in older adults.Nurses and therapists described the challenge of making clinical decisions with limited referral information combined with constant pressure to keep home visits brief and infrequent. Some patients were too sick to be managed at home with available resources or had been promised care that was inappropriate or not feasible. Referral information that was incomplete or contradictory and prescribed drug regimens that were unclear, unsafe, too complicated, or too expensive were time consuming and created impediments to patient progress. The pressures faced by professional staff created incentives to place HHAs and confusion about the goals for such placements.Nurses and therapists reported that their primary method of ensuring patient stability and averting unplanned trips back to the hospital was to place an HHA. To be reimbursed, HHA placement requires that the patient need help with ADLs. Patients, however, were typically more interested in receiving help with instrumental ADLS such as shopping or cleaning, rather than personal care such as bathing. Sometimes patients were encouraged to let the HHA help with ADLs in exchange for having the HHA also perform the instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which were of more interest to the patient. As the aide's role expanded, there was potential for the patient to become more sedentary and ultimately to lose function.Home health aides can play a key role in fostering independence once they learn that "doing for" a patient, while efficient in the short term, results in lost confidence, physical deconditioning, and increasing dependence. However, HHAs explained that they were neither trained nor authorized to orchestrate the gradual transition of activity that would increase the patient's participation in self-care. The typical HHA care plan lists tasks the aide will perform rather than outlining steps for the HHA and patient to take to gradually assign more responsibility to the patient as physical abilities improve. The nurses and HHAs reported that HHAs did most of the work for patients right up to the day of discharge. Visit frequency decreased, but changing the content of the HHA care plan takes time and is especially complicated if multiple HHAs are involved in a case. Discussions of discharging the HHA were often met with resistance as patients expressed anxiety about being able to care for themselves. HHAs worried they would be reported to their supervisors if they exerted less physical effort than the patient. The HCA policy of placing HHAs for standardized blocks of time, although efficient for scheduling, inadvertently fostered patient dependence and complicated setting limits on HHA activities. HHAs reported performing inappropriate tasks because they and their patients believed they should stay busy. All HHAs with whom we met described how unclear expectations resulted in their assuming inappropriate household chores. For example, a patient's daughter left the HHA written instructions to wash the entire family's dishes left from the previous evening. Male HHAs described pressure to perform such handyman services as moving furniture and seasonal cleaning. When we explored this issue with the older adults in the focus group, they reported the term "home health aide" implied help with housework. They described uncertainty about lines of authority regarding the HHA and feeling obligated to find tasks to "keep her busy."The work group discovered that many caregivers and patients do not realize that remaining sedentary is hazardous, not recuperative. Staff reported meeting resistance when they suggested increasing physical activity or functional independence. It was evident that many gauged how "good" a staff member was by their performance of physical tasks. Staff reported that attempts to teach patients safer methods for ADL performance were met with resistance, effectively saying, "Let the aide do it if I can't do it like I always did." Time constraints tempt staff to comply rather than investing the energy needed to overcome such resistance.In the past, HCAs cleaned and repaired donated durable medical equipment, such as walkers or tub benches, for temporary loan to patients. Because accreditation standards now discourage this practice, delayed acquisition of equipment also slowed progress toward independent function. HHAs described assisting patients for extended periods because caregivers and professionals failed to acquire needed equipment. Identifying and Pilot Testing Solutions The work group agreed that having a specific stated goal of care was essential and that—depending on the type and severity of the event—it was generally realistic to expect patients to regain the functional abilities they had just prior to the event that precipitated home care ( Table 3  ). Chronically "deconditioned" patients might even improve above that baseline. The work group discussed engaging patients in goal setting, realizing that too often goals are set for, rather than with, patients. Review of the literature (Bradley, Bogardus, Tinetti, and Inouye 1999   ; Kiresuk and Sherman 1968   ; Molde and Baker 1985   ; Prochaska 1991   ; Rodin and Langer 1977   ) led to agreement to specifically ask patients what they hoped to achieve during home care and precisely what help was needed to reach that goal. Patient goals were recorded on the Self-care Progress Report, and staff explained their interventions in relation to goal achievement. Discussing goals with patients taught clinicians the importance of assessing recent (2–4 weeks) functional abilities, identifying existing systems for meeting needs, and developing a shared definition of when goals had been met. The work group identified the importance of patients, family, and HCA staff sharing the ultimate goal of achieving functional independence.Clinicians developed caution about changing existing patterns of care that could be difficult to reestablish (for example, disrupting a daughter's weekly visits to help her mother shower by scheduling an HHA, typically for more frequent bathing assistance). Clinicians learned to weigh the urge to devise new systems of care for patients against patterns of care that patients can sustain. For a patient who would always need stand-by assistance to shower safely, but sponge bathes satisfactorily at the sink, there was no long-term benefit to securing a shower chair and placing an HHA for bathing. Staff also became mindful of not inadvertently undermining patient's self-confidence by performing tasks that patients were capable of managing. A common example was not fully bathing patients who were physically able to participate in washing themselves. Patients were given every opportunity to safely practice self-care activities with an HHA to assist only as needed.Having the Self-care Progress Report better prepared the nurses to effectively handle instances where patient expectations exceeded the amount or type of service considered justified. The report provides the nurses with the needed objective data to explain their decisions regarding HHA placement, making negotiations less arbitrary. Some patients, usually those who received significant amounts of care in the past, did not agree with our care plans and asked their physicians to refer them to other agencies, but the volume of such cases was no greater than usual. There were no complaints to staff monitoring patient satisfaction as a result of implementing the Restorative Care model.Use of the Self-care Progress Report was central because it clarified goals, established the baseline, standardized the assessment for HHA placement, clarified care responsibilities across the multiple providers, and tracked patients' incremental progress toward functional independence. It provided the staff with a framework for describing the purpose of home care. After the admitting clinician started the Self-care Progress Report it remained in the home as a guide, updated as the patient progressed. Often the nurse and patient agreed that an HHA was not needed. When assessment indicated the patient did not have or was not expected to regain function for a particular task, the staff immediately pursued non-HCA sources for ongoing assistance. The goal of HHA care was to help the patient safely practice regaining function. Use of the report authorized HHAs to expect patients to become more active in ADLs and IADLs and protected them against unrealistic expectations. The report specified the ADL subtasks the HHA performed initially and clarified that, to foster independence, as the patient could do more the HHA would do less. The HHA hours would gradually decrease to avoid abrupt changes in the pattern of care. It was also found helpful to stop HHA care before stopping professional visits, to reassure patients that help was still available should issues arise during the adjustment time after the HHAs were withdrawn.The nurses learned to explain and reiterate the functional goals of care, especially for patients who previously had "do-for" home care. By objectively assessing and documenting those tasks the patient could perform without help, staff were better able to differentiate between necessary help and care that the patient, family, or physician desired. During pilot testing we identified patients already receiving home care services who, although apparently physically capable of more self-care, resisted attempts to alter their functional status. We used these situations—for which any change would require extraordinary, united, clinical, and administrative efforts—as case studies to learn how HCA staff might avoid creating similar dependency in the future.To hasten patient progress, therapists and nurses were cross-trained in screening assessments of impairments that can impede function: mental status, depression, and gait and balance deficits. After this training, staff reported heightened awareness for early referral to other disciplines to increase patient mobility and participation in self-care. Identifying the need to broaden HHA training, a group of eight HHAs were paid to attend an all-day restorative care conference specifically designed for our project and held at a rehabilitation hospital. Conference faculty were physical and occupational therapists, rehabilitation aides, and a behavioral psychologist. The curriculum, based on a Rehabilitation Hospital Aide Program, addressed basic rehabilitation services including coaching patients on ADL subtasks, mobility activities, and use of assistive devices. HHAs were trained to help patients follow through on prescribed exercises and gait and transfer training. HCA nurses and therapists participated in role playing and discussions with the HHAs. This conference broadened HHA training and highlighted the unique wisdom and ability that experienced HHAs contribute to improving function in older patients. Several HHAs noted they had never before been invited to a multidisciplinary education session, paid to spend a day talking about their work, and treated to lunch.Our philosophy of dissemination was that those who were expected to implement the change needed to have the time to help develop the process. After a year of incrementally testing and refining our methods, work group members and their supervisors were enthusiastic about disseminating the restorative care model to all clinicians (11 nurses, 12 physical therapists, and 1 occupational therapist) in the demonstration branch. Educational sessions, small group discussions, and individual case reviews were used to describe the restorative care model, constantly inviting staff critique and integrating their suggestions. Monthly multidisciplinary staff meetings were instituted for staff to seek assistance with cases deemed to be especially challenging or resource intensive. Because we had trained a small cadre of HHAs, scheduling conflicts commonly prevented assignment of the specifically trained HHAs. To overcome this problem, nurses learned to explain the Self-care Progress Report simultaneously to the HHA, patient, and other caregivers. In addition to being efficient, staff described increased teamwork and camaraderie based on these joint meetings and working toward common goals. Our ideal model would be for all HHAs to have the additional training and then to start each patient placement with a brief joint meeting. When the focus of care became function, nurses reported that they were quicker to involve physical and occupational therapists and to instruct the HHAs to get patients up as soon as possible. HCA supervisors, chart review, and supervisory conversations noted that demonstration branch staff were unique in their emphasis on "getting patients moving." The HHAs' response to the restorative model was particularly positive. They reported feeling more support from professional staff and for recognition of their expertise. Discussion This small-scale, short-cycle project was designed to engage clinicians in changing the culture of clinical home care, moving beyond disease management to focus on functional independence. We learned that many routines common throughout the home care industry create barriers to the functional independence of older patients. We acknowledge that the characteristics of project participants and this one HCA may have influenced our results, potentially limiting generalization to other HCAs. It is hoped, however, that others will benefit from review of our methods of engaging clinicians and consumers in the design and implementation of change in home care. The central premise is that, for effective dissemination of information, those who implement change must have a hand in developing the process. The project successfully assembled clinicians who developed a practical method—the Self-care Progress Report—for setting goals and measuring increments of functional change in busy home care practice. The HCA staff participated in a process to change their practice patterns. Patients and their caregivers participated in developing care plans to reach their personal goals. Agency-wide adoption of the model awaits objective evidence to substantiate the subjective reports of improved patient outcomes, as reported by HCA staff at every level. Analyses of OASIS data to compare outcomes of patients at the experimental branch to those of case-matched patients receiving usual care in the other HCA branches are underway.  None  Table 1.

     With a personal, direct, humorous style, Dr. David Lipschitz has become rather well-known across the United States through his television series, Aging Successfully With Doctor David, which is carried by PBS stations. This first season features 13 half-hour episodes dealing with such issues as exercise, memory loss, death and dying, and the delightful initial episode, "There's Nothing an Older Person Can't Do." With the financial support of the Reynolds Center on Aging, which Dr. Lipschitz directs at the University of Arkansas, this series has been aired in numerous markets including Miami, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas, and Washington, DC, on local PBS affiliates."Doctor David," as he is called on camera, approaches complex issues affecting older persons with a charm and directness that leaves one not only better informed but also with the feeling that growing old can be an adventure in living. His adroit presentations of the findings of medical science in "down-home" language carries the audience along from problem analysis to solutions adapted for individuals at various stages in their aging process. Doctor David weaves in personal stories—his own and those of his patients—to add verisimilitude and good humor. When appropriate to the subject, he invites experts to join in a dialogue with him and the audience that elucidates and personalizes the subjects. His adroit use of a few slides provides specific and timely data; his specific demonstrations make the application of principles and protocols easy for the viewer and his appreciative audiences to understand. Taping his presentations before live audiences adds a dynamic that certainly enlivens the presentations of complicated subjects.For example, in the episode on exercise, Doctor David explains the value of both endurance and resistance training exercise regimes. He highlights the achievements of members of his audience in restoring and maintaining high levels of function. Inviting members of his audience to describe their efforts and successes he provides on-camera evidence of the value of the exercise routines he presents. Doctor David discusses the results of an important investigation into strength building exercises with very frail elders and provides dramatic videos of older people overcoming tremendous odds to rebuild their strength and thus reduce the probability of falling and other problems associated with the atrophying of their muscles. In this segment, Dr. William Evans, a nationally recognized expert on exercise, joins Doctor David in explaining the rationale and techniques for effective exercise.In a program on death and dying, Doctor David approaches the subject by telling a poignant story from his own experience. Then he leads the viewers through the minefields of worry and grief associated with the dying process from the standpoint of both the patient and family members going through the trauma of approaching death. Doctor David interviews a guest from a local hospice program who provides important insights into pain management, special relationships, and realities of dying. This program searches for answers in a manner this reviewer has seldom experienced despite attending numerous sessions on death and dying, caregiving, and grief counseling. Doctor David uses a matter-of-fact approach to the subjects and is particularly helpful in raising issues and suggesting ways in which final months may be made less threatening. As one who has cared for many individuals facing death and living, Doctor David combines his clinical training, his communication skills, and his humanity effectively.The first season opened with "There's Nothing an Older Person Can't Do," a clever discussion by Dr. Lipschitz about the expectations and realities of aging leading nicely to his conclusion that "it's never too early or too late" to have a quality life. He explains that with aging one has reduced reserve capacity requiring one to adapt to one's changing capacities, but he moves quickly to the theme of this episode—there is (almost) nothing an older person can't do. His graphic descriptions of the effects of aging on the body are clear and concise. This episode provides viewers with the facts that demythologize aging and leaves them with positive feelings about their own age. Doctor David has a particular style of discussing complicated issues in simple terms. This series is a valuable resource for individuals, teachers, family members, and, I dare say, a useful and inspiring guide for physicians eager to help their patients understand not only their pathologies but also the possibilities for their successful aging.Videotapes of the episodes are available for purchase via the World Wide Web at  www.aetn.org/drdavid  ($24.95 each). The topics addressed in the first season (in addition to the four mentioned in this review) include stress management, graying of America, nutrition, health screenings, depression, polypharmacy, Alzheimer's, children caring for parents, and alternative medicine. The Arkansas Educational Television Network, PBS, and the Donald W. Reynolds Center on Aging at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences have announced a second season covering topics such as coronary artery disease, hearing and vision loss, cancer, rural health care, malnutrition, nursing home care, osteoporosis, elder abuse, and sexuality and aging. Based on the quality of the programs in the first season, their timeliness and solid scientific and clinical foundation, gerontologists should consider urging their PBS affiliates to air both series to viewers in their areas.Note: The editors of The Gerontologist will welcome suggestions about material available on the web that readers think warrants the attention of a wider audience.

     To the Editor: I share Dr. Palmore's view that "ageism is a major problem in our society" (Palmore 2000   ). However, I disagree with the remedy he proposes: replacing terms that he believes have negative connotations, including "old," with another set that he believes has neutral or positive connotations, including "older person."Replacing "old" with "older person" implies that she or he should be defined in relation to younger individuals in our society, and therefore enhances the marginalization that is part of ageism. In the same way, "female doctor" perpetuates the notion that the unmarked term "doctor" properly applies to males.Similarly, the terms "grandparent" and "retired person," that Dr. Palmore also advocates, implicitly send a message that their identity should be defined in relation to the young; that is, by the work history of their younger years or by their line of succession. Further, these terms reinforce the belief that grandparenthood and retirement are inevitable states. According to a recent survey of baby boomers, 80% reported that they expect to continue working during "retirement," either full- or part-time.Another type of problem arises from giving an unfamiliar meaning to a familiar term, such as the proposed "veteran," which could have an unanticipated consequence. Awkward substitutions may provoke a notion that there is something pejorative about the replaced term, even if it is not the case; or else accentuate the pejorative connotation, if it does exist, by indirectly drawing attention to it.The underlying assumption of the editorial is that it is "language that implicitly perpetuates ageism." Instead, the terms reflect ageism. It seems futile to change the mirror when the image persists. This futility was discovered by those who had been called "Negroes" before the Civil Rights Movement. Amidst chants of "Black is beautiful," they replaced the term with "Blacks." But "Blacks" was eventually replaced with "African Americans" because changing terms had not altered reality: the persistence of prejudice by Whites, and the internalized effects of it on the targets.We need to work towards a time when those who have reached old age, as well as those who have not, share a conviction that gray is beautiful, or at least acceptable. When we achieve this, the connotation of labels will no longer be an issue. Dr. Palmore replies: I appreciate Dr. Levy's concern with ageism in our society and how to reduce it. Our main disagreement appears to be whether negative terms perpetuate ageism or merely "reflect ageism."There is a considerable body of research that shows that the terms and concepts people use both reflect AND affect attitudes (Palmore 1999   ; Blair and Banaji 1996   ; Banaji and Hardin 1996   ). Furthermore, it is common sense that this is so: If we call someone "senile" or "decrepit," this will usually affect the listener's perception and attitude toward the person.As for which terms are more negative, neutral, or positive, there is much controversy in the field. However, it seems clear that when "aging" is used as a euphemism for deterioration, and when "old" is used as a euphemism for senile or decrepit, it tends to perpetuate the stereotype that these are equivalent terms.My plea is simply that we gerontologists become especially sensitive and careful about the connotations and effects of the terms we use for "senior citizens."

     Laurence G. Branch, PhDMaine's state-funded home-based care (HBC) program succeeds in aligning resources with the care needs of consumers. Using trained nurse assessors who develop and authorize service plans, the Maine HBC program targets home care services to those most in need. A recent analysis of the program found that authorized service plan costs increased consistently and in a linear relationship with levels of impairment. From a state policy perspective, this finding provides a basis for developing policies that more equitably distribute limited state-funded home- and community-based resources to those most in need of care. Background In their meta-analysis of 27 home- and community-based care service studies, Weissert, Cready, and Pavelak 1988    concluded that home- and community-based resources are not adequately targeted to those in greatest need. This failure to align resources with need, combined with the growth in home health expenditures, leaves state policy makers struggling with "how to provide needed services on an equitable basis and do so in such a manner that family caregivers do not try to substitute publicly-funded [sic] care for the care they have been long providing" (Hudson 1996   , p. 456). Although case mix classification systems (Fries and Cooney 1985   ) and payment methods have been developed to identify and allocate resources in nursing facilities, methods for aligning home care need with resource requirements remain relatively unknown. Maine's Experience In 1996, Maine instituted a mandatory statewide preadmission screening program using a uniform assessment process for medical eligibility determination (MED). This assessment determines medical eligibility for a range of Medicaid and state-funded services including nursing-facility care, specialized adult family care homes, and Medicaid and state-funded home- and community-care services. A critical component of this process is the development of service plans that provide consumers with estimates of available public support for home care services and estimates of their out-of-pocket costs. For eligible consumers who choose to receive their care at home, this service plan serves as the formal basis (authorization) for payment by Medicaid or the state-funded HBC program. This approach addresses many of the limitations in home care resource allocation that have historically plagued such programs. The use of a standardized assessment instrument with uniform definitions and the use of a single point of entry into Maine's long-term care system provide a comprehensive system for determining service needs and resource requirements.The Maine HBC program is designed to provide subsidized home care services to consumers with long-term care needs whose contribution to the cost of care is based on their income and assets. The program permits authorized service plans for eligible consumers for up to 85% of the cost of nursing-facility care. Although the minimum medical need eligibility criteria for the program are relatively low (see  Appendix , Note 1), approximately 10% of HBC program consumers meet the medical need definition for Medicaid nursing facility certifiability. Thus, the HBC program provides support to a broad array of long-term care consumers and offers an opportunity to consider how well-trained nurse assessors are able to align resources to consumers' needs. Prior to the Fall of 2000, service plan authorization guidelines and spending limits other than the maximum amount did not exist. Analysis As part of recent state policy deliberations, the Maine Department of Human Services asked the Muskie School at the University of Southern Maine to conduct an analysis of its program and examine the question: How well do resource allocations reflect the levels of consumers' needs for services? This question was raised in response to occasional instances of consumers with relatively low levels of need for assistance receiving authorized service plans at or near the program cap (i.e., 85% of nursing home care).The central questions of the analysis were: (a) How should level of need be defined? (b) Who is being served by the HBC program? (c) What is the relationship between service plan costs and level of need? (d) What are the policy implications? Definition of Levels For purposes of this analysis, consumers with authorized HBC service plans were classified into one of four levels of need for assistance. These levels were defined using a combination of Medicaid program and HBC program eligibility criteria to permit examination of the relationship between Medicaid and HBC client need and payment policies.Medical eligibility criteria defining Medicaid nursing facility-level care (see  Appendix , Note 2) were used to define the highest level of need group, Level Four. The next highest level, Level Three, has no parallel in Medicaid or explicit HBC eligibility policy. Level Three classification criteria were: (a) need for physical assistance with two or more of five higher order activities of daily living (ADLs) and (b) assistance with at least three instrumental ADLs (IADLS) (e.g., meal preparation, routine housework, grocery shopping, or laundry). Level Two classification criteria mirror the minimum need eligibility criteria for services under the Medicaid Private Duty Nursing Program (persons with a nursing need once a month and at least limited assistance on two or more of seven ADLs—bathing, dressing, locomotion, bed mobility, transfer, eating, or toilet use). The minimum eligibility criteria for assistance under the HBC Program (see  Appendix , Note 1) were used to define the lowest level of need group, Level One. The Consumers  Table 1  indicates that the distribution among the need level groups was similar in 1999 and 2000 for consumers with authorized HBC service plans. In each year, approximately one half were in the least impaired group, and roughly 10% were in the most impaired group (nursing-facility level).Consumers' characteristics for each level of need can also be described using counts of limitations in ADLs and Cognitive Performance Score (CPS; Morris et al. 1994   ).  Table 2  confirms the relatively linear increase in functional impairment for the four levels of need used in this analysis based on state fiscal year (SFY) 2000 data. Costs  Table 2  also presents the average authorized service plan costs for each of the four levels. These costs include all authorized covered services, and may include homemaker, personal care attendant, certified nursing assistant, home health aide, nursing fees, and monthly emergency response service fees. At the highest level of need, Level Four, the average authorized service plan cost was $1,279. In contrast, consumers with authorized service plans who are at the lowest need level (Level One), had average costs of $500, less than half the average authorized cost for those with nursing facility-level (Level Four) needs. For persons in the Level Two group, where some nursing need is required in addition to ADL and IADL assistance, average service plan costs were $619; this was due, at least in part, to the introduction of monthly nursing visit costs. For consumers in the Level Three group, who have need for assistance with higher order ADLs but not necessarily nursing services, average authorized service plan costs ($830 per month) were higher than for Levels One and Two. The standard deviations for average authorized service plan costs are consistently smaller than the mean or median, although not surprisingly; as the group sizes diminish at levels of greater need, the standard deviations become larger. Fig. 1  shows that the pattern of relative linearity between need and authorized expenditures persists over time. Furthermore, during SFY 2000 HBC consumer's average authorized service plan costs were very similar across the four levels of need when compared with data on average authorized service plan costs in 1999. Policy Implications This analysis has a number of important policy implications. First, the current system for assessing the need for services using trained nurse assessors, a uniform assessment instrument, and authorized service plans has resulted in an alignment of resources with care needs. Second, this analysis suggests that state program data can be used for the analysis of care needs and spending patterns. Third, the data from this analysis can be used for developing payment guidelines and policies that will support the equitable allocation of resources to people with different care needs. Unanswered Questions In light of the challenges faced by state policy makers to meet growing demand for in-home services with limited resources, research is needed to find acceptable and meaningful measures of need for home-care services. Such research must control for the quality of home-care services offered and the adequacy of such services to meet consumers' needs. As the cost and demand for home care continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly critical for policy makers to obtain assistance in finding optimal consumer need classification options and resource allocation metrics. This is complicated by the varying home-care policies and available funding in each state. Further research needs to provide options that can be effectively tailored to the specific policies and systems in each state. Research is also needed to explain the potential pitfalls of various need-based home care resource allocation options. Conclusions As data on long-term care consumers, the services they use, and the costs of such services become increasingly available, analyses to consider the rationality of policies will become increasingly possible. This mini-analysis suggests the need for further collaboration between state long-term care policy makers, policy analysts, and university-based researchers in the alignment of policy questions with available data for addressing long-term care policies. Further, by moving beyond simple descriptive analyses, collaborating states and state–university partnerships can offer new insights through interstate comparative analyses and a broader understanding of the dynamic of long-term care service utilization and potential improvements in the allocation of public resources.NotesHome-based care eligibility: (a) consumer requires cueing support daily for dressing, eating, toilet use or bathing, or (b) consumer requires assistance with one ADL and assistance with two or more IADLs—meal preparation, routine housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or has a combination of nursing need ADL and IADL needs.Nursing facility-level of need in Maine is defined by need for: (a) skilled nursing services 7 days per week; (b) therapies 5 or more days per week; (c) extensive assistance required in three or more higher order ADLs such as locomotion, bed mobility, transfer, eating or toilet use; or (d) a combination of ADL of cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, or skilled service need.The Forum  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Long-term care policies and programs in the United States suffer from a major flaw: They are balanced toward a model of nursing home care that, regardless of its technical quality, tends to be associated with a poor quality of life for consumers. This article proposes quality-of-life domains—namely, security, comfort, meaningful activity, relationships, enjoyment, dignity, autonomy, privacy, individuality, spiritual well-being, and functional competence. It argues that these kinds of quality-of-life outcomes are minimized in current quality assessment and given credence only after health and safety outcomes are considered. Five trends are reviewed that might lead to a more consumer-centered emphasis on quality of life: the disability rights movement, the emphasis on consumer direction, the growth of assisted living, increasing attention to physical environments, and efforts to bring about culture change in nursing homes. Building on these trends, the article concludes with strategies to move beyond current stalemates and polarized arguments toward forms of long-term care that are more compatible with a good quality of life.   Public policy ,  Nursing homes ,  Home care ,  Assisted living Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDLong-term care (LTC) in the United States requires serious and creative attention. It is largely off the political radar screen in any meaningful way, and public rhetoric about it seems off the point. The year 2000 marks a historic opportunity to build on current needs and positive models to build better long-term care. The umbrella questions inspiring this article are not research questions but require reflection on existing research and scholarship. For example, what can and should we expect for a good life for those receiving LTC? Why are discussions about LTC so polarized? Why is forward progress in the direction preferred by consumers of LTC so difficult to achieve? What strategies hold promise to improve long-term care?Plenty of suggestive research is available to aid in examining broader current LTC policy and practice and its effects, but the relevant scholarly work is not neatly collected and arranged to offer policy and practice insights; some assembly is required. The conclusions here partly result from sifting through findings from my own and others' research. Relevant scholarship includes preference studies, health services outcome studies, the results of social experiments in LTC, social science studies that elucidate the nature of well-being, and anthropological, philosophical, and legal studies. Also relevant are the accounts of biographers and novelists, the latter often based on firsthand experience. For example, the "data" of the late Janet Tulloch, for decades a resident of a nursing home in Washington, DC, and a keen observer of life in nursing homes, should not be discounted because she was a consumer and sometimes fictionalized her observations (Tulloch 1975   ). When she notes that a care plan can be an "instrument of terror" for a nursing home resident (Tulloch 1995   ), her comment should be taken as seriously as that of a sociologist who performed more conventional research.Most people who reach middle years also can test their generalizations about LTC against the experiences of family members and friends. Reflecting on personal "data" is a good antidote to the hubris of presuming to discuss, let alone measure, a good quality of life for those faced with the realities of LTC and the conditions and circumstances that generated its need. As of this writing, the most vivid part of my database includes the experiences of my father (age 93 and healthy but with encroaching macular degeneration) and my mother (age 86 and functionally limited because of osteoporosis), who are so far managing at home; my mother-in-law, who is experiencing physical and cognitive post-stroke problems in a New York assisted living setting; my maternal aunt, who had intensive and escalating needs for both formal and family care during the 3 months between diagnosis of liver cancer and her death in her own home close to her 80th birthday; a paternal uncle, whose Parkinson's disease limits his functioning drastically, first at home with his wife and now in an assisted living setting in Ontario; a paternal aunt, whose multiple sclerosis necessitated years of in-home care and about 6 years of nursing home care before her death; and other now mostly deceased uncles and aunts and more distant relatives who collectively illustrate a wide variety of chronic illnesses and social circumstances with an admixture of mental health problems and, for a few, Alzheimer's disease. This collection of family stories immediately reveals that one solution cannot fit all. So, too, do findings from a 5-year longitudinal in-depth study of 300 family caregivers (Kane and Penrod 1995   ; Kane, Reinardy, Penrod, Huck, and Finch 1999   ), which shows that the dominant tendency in family care (i.e., female, average age in the late 50s) masks the incredible variety that occurs in the real world and the imaginative way ordinary people invent solutions to problems that disability creates in their everyday lives.At the risk of being trite, those thinking about LTC for older people must consider the meaning of life for life's last decades. In actuality, LTC discussions often bog down in technicalities, which, though important, fail to strike at the heart of the matter. Technical topics include identifying the best assessment tools for eligibility for publicly funded LTC, developing better ways to key payment for care to the cost of providing it through case-mix adjusted formulas, determining the likely market for LTC insurance, or estimating the cost and benefit of tax credits for family members providing LTC under various circumstances. Perhaps most ubiquitous, contentious, and anxiety-provoking of all technical LTC topics is the woodwork effect: that is, the propensity for people who would shun nursing homes to come out of the woodwork to use more attractive forms of LTC, thus turning a potentially cost-effective alternative service into an expensive add-on (Kane and Kane 1987   ; Kemper, Applebaum, and Harrigan 1987   ; Weissert 1985   ). Indeed, it is high time to retire the woodwork effect as a concern. A confirmed woodwork effect could even be a sign of success if it meant that a state or community had effected wider access to the kind of LTC programs that people want to use. Rather than eliminating the spread of more user-friendly LTC, gerontologists are challenged to alter the essential nature of all LTC into more desirable forms while keeping down the price of services in all sectors (nursing homes, assisted living, and home care). Examples of successful state efforts in that regard are available (Alecxih, Lutzky, and Corea 1996   ; General Accounting Office (GAO) 1994   ; Kane, Kane, Ladd, and Nielsen 1998   ). Eyes tend to glaze over when the technical issues are discussed. Neither the general public nor the press finds LTC particularly fascinating. The older public and their family members tend to face LTC as an issue only when an individual crisis requires action; there is virtually no constituency among the elderly population for fundamental LTC reform. The press concentrates on covering quality problems (Eisler 1996   ; Tofani 2000   ; Goldstein 2001a   , Goldstein 2001b   ; Steinhauer 2001   ). Apart from human interest stories and periodic excitement about potential cures for the conditions necessitating LTC, good news is no news for those who cover the LTC beat in the media.However, LTC is a subject that should be capable of engaging the imagination positively. For many people, LTC decisions dictate the last chapter of their biographies—the chapter that should make sense of the story. LTC shapes where people live, how they live, whom they see, what they do, and the relationships transpiring within families and communities. How we choose to view LTC as a society, therefore, entails considering subjects as profound as the meaning of life. LTC is intimate care, and how it is given, when it is given, and by whom it is given shapes the biography of the LTC consumer and, by extension, the biography of family caregivers and the collective biography of the whole family.By LTC, I refer to any personal care and assistance that an individual might receive on a long-term basis because of a disability or chronic illness that limits his or her ability to function (Kane and Kane 1987   ; Kane, Kane, and Ladd 1998   ). Nursing home care is obviously part of LTC, but so too is care that people receive while living in a wide variety of other settings, including private homes and apartments and a wide array of congregate living settings with services that have sprung up, in part, because of consumer demand for a place more habitable than the typical nursing home (Kane and Wilson 1993   ).The currency of language easily becomes tarnished and soon, perhaps, the term "long-term care" (LTC) will be passé. "Long-term services" is already a preferred term among some people with disabilities (National Institute for Long-Term Services 1996   ). Recently the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has grouped its LTC efforts for people of all ages under the umbrella term "supportive services." But whatever it is called, LTC is the mixture of concrete tasks that enable a person with a disability to flourish as much as possible despite that disability; these tasks are sometimes arduous, sometimes time-consuming, sometimes tedious, and often unpredictable and inimical to scheduling. Gerontologists use the shorthand jargon ADLs (activities of daily living) and IADLs (instrumental activities of daily living) to refer to the areas of functioning for which the LTC consumer requires assistance. These terms, while useful, tend to distance us from the phenomenon of the person whose life is complicated by the need for help, whose life may sometimes be sustained by the care, whose aspirations might be made possible because of care received, and whose life is too often made more than necessarily miserable by the circumstances and conditions of LTC.Bluntly put, LTC policies and practices in the United States are flawed, particularly for those LTC consumers who are old. Moreover, the quality of life for LTC consumers is compromised by a societal reluctance to come to grips with these flaws. Without collective agreement on what is a good or even an acceptable quality of life for someone who needs LTC, the gerontological community cannot even cast relevant research questions or conduct program evaluations in a way that gets to the heart of the matter. And until a realistic view of the goals of LTC and the range of what is possible for an LTC provider to produce is forged, there is danger of unfairly scapegoating LTC providers for their inability to bring about universal happy endings. We are at risk of turning the great bulk of well-intended, hard-working LTC providers into a depressed and beleaguered group who are too fearful of missteps to exercise creativity or even common sense in their daily work.Anyone following the pendulum swings in nursing home regulation since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 knows that the current climate is particularly unforgiving, intolerant of mishaps or bad results (Kapp 1997   ). Regulators and policymakers often expect too much of nursing homes and of other LTC providers. Care managers and health care professionals may also expect too much of themselves if they aspire to eliminate all bad outcomes for clients on their watches. With such grandiose goals, professionals may hasten clients into more protected settings where, of course, the original actors tend to lose track of them and their ultimate outcomes (Kane and Caplan 1993   ). Ironically, excessive expectations for promoting health and safety are often accompanied by low expectations and excessive compromise regarding quality of life. Real change in the way most Americans can expect to receive LTC is strikingly difficult to achieve. Communities will need to rethink LTC drastically if fundamental alterations are to be achieved. Politicians talk about facilitating LTC insurance and providing tax credits for LTC, but glide over the actual details of the service that would be purchased with the insurance or tax credits.The rest of this article is divided into four sections: (1) an opinion about what is wrong with LTC policy and practice; (2) concepts that define a good quality of life in LTC; (3) identification of LTC trends that offer some hope for improvements in quality of life for LTC consumers; and (4) brief suggestions about strategies for bridging the chasm between LTC and what most people would recognize as a good quality of life. Problems With LTC In the United States, the bulk of public dollars go where older people do not want to go: to nursing homes (Kane, Kane, and Ladd 1998   ). Little imagination is needed to recognize why older people prefer to avoid typical nursing homes and why family members experience guilt and anguish when they see no other choice. Few can conceive of living in the constrained circumstances of the nursing home, particularly if a room and bath are shared. Few can picture adapting to rigid routines for daily life. My father, age 93 at this writing, typically has wine with his evening meal and rarely goes to bed before the 11 o'clock news is finished. If he needed nursing home care, he would be expected to adapt to a different life rhythm. Though he is a brilliant competitor in duplicate bridge, he would be expected to make do with bingo and valentines. More than a quarter of a century ago, Elaine Brody likened the one-size-fits-all nursing home to the Procrustean bed of the myth; victims were chopped or stretched to fit the bed (Brody 1973   ). This metaphor is still apt. Research in learned helplessness (Avorn and Langer 1982   ; Langer and Rodin 1976   ) informs us of the destructive effects such regimens have on the human spirit, creating listlessness, depression, and abandonment of efforts to exert control. A well-publicized report from the SUPPORT study indicated that almost 30% of a sample of seriously ill older people would "rather die" than move permanently to a nursing home (Mattimore et al. 1997   ). These reactions predominate across cultural and ethnic groups. A poster displayed at the year 2000 annual meeting of The Gerontological Society of America reported a response of an 86-year-old African American nursing home resident to the standard question: How would you rate your mental health, excellent, good, fair, or poor: "My mental health is starving because I can't go nowhere." Said another respondent of the same age and race: "It's just like not living" (Adamek 2000   ). "Just not living" and "rather be dead" are such dismal outcomes for life in nursing homes that the various quality-of-care indicators should be rendered almost irrelevant against such indictments.The quality of LTC has been a perennial subject since federal and state governments began investing large public sums in financing LTC after 1965. In 1983 the Institute of Medicine took a far-reaching look at quality in one sector—the nursing home. Its 2-year study and 1986 report ushered in the regulatory reforms of 1987 (Institute of Medicine 1986   ). Now more than a decade later, as policy-making bodies examine quality in nursing homes and other forms of LTC, getting agreement on the state of current quality is almost impossible. Some people argue that almost no improvement has been made in the quality of nursing homes since 1987, citing GAO reports (General Accounting Office (GAO) 1998   ; General Accounting Office (GAO) 1999a   ; General Accounting Office (GAO) 1999b   ) and other exposés (Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 1999a   ; Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 1999b   ) that point to serious care violations (e.g., residents who are unfed, unattended in physical pain, suffering infections, malnutrition, neglect, and abuse) and that call for much more stringent enforcement standards. These same advocates tend to argue that persons using in-home services and assisted living in all likelihood suffer from the same quality problems as do nursing home residents, but that data shortfalls prohibit knowing it.Arguably, however, positive strides in quality of care have occurred in nursing homes since the 1987 regulatory reforms. It seems counterproductive and unnecessarily polarizing to deny these strides. Physical restraints are drastically (though not enough) reduced; geriatric medicine has, at least to some degree, made its way to nursing homes (Evans and Strumpf 1989   ; Kane, Williams, Williams, and Kane 1993   ). Nurse practitioners are more evident (Mezey, Lynaugh, and Cartier 1989   ; Mezey and McGivern 1986   ). The Minimum Data Set for nursing homes (Morris et al. 1990   ) has permitted tracking quality indicators and doing something about them. But even if there were no quality-of-care problems in nursing homes, conventional nursing homes arguably fail the quality test because of the severe strictures on life in these settings. Put simply, the total disenfranchisement associated with living in a nursing home is too high a price to pay for even high-quality technical care. True, some nursing homes all over the country are working to transform the experience of living in and working in a nursing home, a movement discussed below (Fagan, Williams, and Burger 1997   ; Lustbader 2001   ). Some commentators find this growing attention to quality of life in nursing homes exciting and encouraging, whereas others think these efforts are almost trivial in relation to what they view as extreme quality-of-care problems in nursing homes.How good are in-home services and personal attendant services, the bedrock of LTC? The data available about the quality of home care (aside from Medicare home health care, which is not an LTC program) differ in nature from data on quality of nursing home care. The kinds of reports that emanate from home care research speak to consumer satisfaction—and generally speaking, consumers tend to be satisfied with home care; the ability to be at home with the help of home care is seen as good in itself. Undoubtedly, home care has been spared the same rigorous and unforgiving standard as nursing home care. One approach to this inconsistency would insist on comparable data so that home care could be held to account. Another approach would consider what is intrinsically good about home care that puts it in a different category of inspection, and determine how those good features could be, at least in part, replicated in congregate living situations now going under names like nursing homes, assisted living, adult family homes, residential care facilities, and the like. Given all the cultural associations with home—autonomy, familiarity, history, relationships, privacy, dignity—it is perhaps understandable that consumers have little desire to subject their home care service to the same criteria used to look at quality of nursing homes. Indeed, the main critique of home care services, including the most flexible form of personal assistant services, sometimes called personal attendant services, is that they are often unavailable through public funding for older people needing LTC. Likewise, in-home care is often too skimpy and wrongly timed and configured. Moreover, those who fail to qualify financially for public programs complain that information about purchasing care is often hard to come by and, once found, the care is too expensive for many middle-class citizens (Morris, Caro, and Hansan 1998   ).And what about new congregate care settings? The last decade has witnessed a revolution in forms of residentially based LTC, with new ways of combining housing and services (Kane and Wilson 1993   ). Again, opinions are sharply polarized about this phenomenon, sometimes called "assisted living." Assisted living, at its best, offers an opportunity for older LTC consumers to combine getting the services they need with continuing their lives in the most natural, normal, and meaningful way possible for them. When it works well, it could bring the qualities of home care prized by consumers, with each LTC consumer having control over the rhythms of his or her own life in a self-contained apartment where he or she (or his or her family or agent) calls the shots. Surely, many consumers are choosing this type of care when they must leave their own homes, and when they have the resources or options to select assisted living. Assisted living is licensed and inspected by states, and no federal standards currently govern it. It is a social model of care that in some states is required to have very little nursing presence. To some commentators, assisted living is equated with fraud, false promises, and potential neglect, whereas for others it is seen as a beacon toward a more habitable form of LTC.In short, wise people armed with identical data are divided on the actual quality of all forms of LTC. This disagreement arguably stems from a failure to confront what we as a society expect of LTC, and what tradeoffs we would make if all good outcomes are impossible. One little-tested assumption is that safety—defined vaguely or not at all—is the be-all and end-all of LTC. Embedded in most of our rules and regulations is the idea that LTC should aspire to the best possible quality of life as is consistent with health and safety. But ordinary people may prefer the best health and safety outcomes possible that are consistent with a meaningful quality of life. Without agreement about what we mean by quality and the yardstick that we use to describe it, including the place of quality of life, strident disagreement will persist on how good or bad LTC quality is.To summarize the problems, LTC fails the quality, access, and cost tests. Quality is a lost cause when the predominant forms of LTC are devalued by the consumer. Access to care at home and in places worthy of the name "home" is hard to come by, even for those who have at least some means to pay (Morris et al. 1998   ). Public and private costs are high and rising. Moreover, costs tend to exclude the high economic costs—let alone the emotional and health toll—of family caregivers (Arno, Levine, and Memmott 1999   ), who are, in the words of the title of a recent book, "always on call" (Levine 2000   ). Beyond that is a current crisis in the LTC labor force—sometimes referred to as the staffing problem. Put simply, the result of full employment is a shortfall of people to work in all LTC sectors. Formulaic solutions to perceived quality problems in nursing homes—for example, higher legislated staff ratios (Harrington et al. 2000   )—seem beside the point as nursing homes and other programs are struggling merely to staff at the levels current law and common sense dictate. A better approach might be to experiment with ways to organize care and services to achieve desired goals, create rewarding jobs, and determine how to best use the leadership skills of licensed nurses rather than legislating mandatory nurse-to-consumer ratios. Quality of Life A good quality of life (QOL) should be elevated to a priority goal for LTC rather than a pious afterthought to quality of care. But QOL cannot be emphasized absent some common understanding of the phrase. In our current work, we distinguished 11 domains of QOL, each of which will be discussed briefly (Kane et al. 2000   ). Each is expressed as an outcome experienced by an individual rather than by the structural features or processes thought to be associated with the outcomes. If outcomes such as these can be successfully measured, then one can plausibly examine how various programs and practices are associated with the outcomes rather than taking for granted current standards for any inputs embodied in conventional wisdom or regulation. Note, also, that each outcome can be measured in its negative and its positive form. Accentuating the positive is worthwhile. It is sadly narrow to define quality as the absence of negative outcomes. Absence of bedsores, absence of depression, absence of malnutrition—these are hardly evidence of a good quality of life or goals to inspire generations of care providers. Sense of Safety, Security, and Order. A good QOL requires a sense of security about oneself in one's world. A person needs to be able to trust that he or she is living in a benign environment where people are well intended, and where the ordinary ground rules of life are understood. The opposite of this security is a world that feels crazy, lawless, unpredictable, or worse, one that seems dangerous. This QOL domain seems basic, perhaps a foundation block in a Maslovian type of QOL hierarchy. Physical Comfort. Also basic is physical comfort. This includes being free from physical pain and discomfort, including shortness of breath, nausea, constipation, joint pain, and so on. It includes being comfortable in terms of temperature and body position. To some older people, it even includes crisp, freshly laundered sheets. It certainly includes having one's pain or discomfort noticed and addressed. Enjoyment. We rarely think of enjoyment as something worthy of measuring and building programs and settings to achieve, but it certainly is one of the attributes that most of us aspire to in our own lives. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to extrapolate its importance to the lives of those receiving LTC. Meaningful Activity. LTC consumers need to perceive that their lives are replete with interesting and meaningful things to do and see. What is meaningful will differ according to the physical status of the individual. Some people can participate actively in a wide range of activities; others by choice or preference are in spectator roles. Still others, as Kivnick 1993    has demonstrated, can make meaningful contributions to their families, the nursing homes, or the community at large despite their physical dependency on care. Relationships. Banal as it sounds, relationships make life worth living, whether they be relationships of love, friendship, or even of enmity and rivalry. Carter Williams writes of a nursing home resident who asked a friend to visit often "so I will know I am alive" (Williams 1999   ). Reciprocal relationships where the LTC consumer is able to give as well as receive support, advice, and confidences are best of all (Lustbader 1991   ). These relationships may be with family and friends, with other residents (in congregate services), and with paid caregivers. Functional Competence. As an outcome, functional competence means that within the limits of the person's physical and cognitive capacities, the LTC consumer is as independent as he or she wants to be. Many conditions are embedded in this definition just as preferences, aspirations, and capabilities differ. This domain of QOL is extremely sensitive to the physical environments in which older people live and receive care as well as the policies adopted by formal caregiving organizations. Dignity. The next four domains of quality of life might be expected to be correlated with each other, and their relevance may depend more than other domains on cognitive functioning sufficient to process them. Dignity, embedded as a requirement in nursing home regulations, refers to the perception that one's dignity is respected rather than the important but different notion that each person is treated with dignity regardless of whether he or she can perceive indignities. This concept may be less pertinent to the more cognitively impaired, since considerable self-awareness is needed to experience a sense of indignity. Anecdotally, however, we found that some residents with substantial dementia resonated to the concept of dignity. One such person, who had answered most questions with what seemed to be uncomprehending acquiescence, answered a general question about her dignity being respected with a prompt negative followed by a comment that revealed adequate understanding: "That's just the problem here, they treat us as though we are children!" Privacy. By privacy, an outcome related conceptually to dignity, we refer not to having a private room and bath, but rather to experiencing a sense of privacy—that is, being able to be alone when one wishes, to be together in private with others when one wishes, and to be in control of information about oneself. In a seminal work, Westin 1967    specifies four aspects of privacy, namely, solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve, and suggests four reasons why these types of privacy are needed: (1) to exercise autonomy and maintain individuality; (2) to achieve emotional release particularly important at times of loss, shock, or sorrow; (3) to conduct self-evaluation, which requires private information processing and reflection; and (4) to achieve limited and protected communication. Pastalan 1970    argues that these privacy purposes are important to older people and that their environments should be designed to realize such privacy, which is obviously more easily achieved in residential settings with private rooms and baths (Kane, Baker, Salmon, and Veazie 1998   ). Some minimum self-awareness and ability to process events cognitively is, of course, a prerequisite for the privacy domain to be relevant. Even if persons with severe cognitive disabilities prove to have better or worse QOL in private rooms, the dynamic may be related to meaningful activity, enjoyment, comfort, or some other domain rather than privacy itself. Individuality. Individuality refers to the consumer's sense of being known as a person and being able to continue to experience and express his or her identity, and to have desired continuity with the past. From a psychological viewpoint, Tobin has written convincingly that the hardest task for many residents is to maintain their own identity against all the forces that erode their sense of self (Tobin 1991   ). Research has shown that LTC providers in all settings pay insufficient attention to learning about the LTC consumer as a person, a prerequisite to helping the person preserve his or her sense of identity (Degenholtz, Kane, and Kivnick 1997   ; Kane and Degenholtz 1997   ; Kane, Penrod, and Kivnick 1994   ). Autonomy/Choice. Autonomy refers to the perception that one is making decisions and choices and directing one's own life. A series of studies sponsored by the Retirement Research Foundation (Hofland 1988   , Hofland 1990   ), as well as earlier, more basic psychological studies on perceived control (Seligman 1976   ), attest to the importance of this property of autonomy to the well-being, mental health, and even physical health of cognitively intact older people. Ample research also attests, in the words of Lidz and colleagues, to the "erosion" of autonomy in LTC (Lidz, Fischer, and Arnold 1992   ; Kane et al. 1997   ). Spiritual Well-Being. Finally, though elusive and related to both psychological and social well-being, spiritual well-being cannot be ignored as a domain of QOL (Olson and Kane 2000   ). Spiritual well-being may incorporate but go beyond and can be independent of religiousness. Moreover, these constructs, however imperfectly measured, have been associated with health outcomes. The National Institute on Aging and the Fetzer Foundation did substantial work in the 1990s to specify constructs and measures in the spiritual arena (Fetzer Institute 1999   ).Collectively, the 11 domains of quality of life discussed above resonate to two separate and complementary types of human needs or impulses, both the stuff of novels as well as psychology and sociology, namely, the individualistic versus the community-centered road to fulfillment. Both are important and, though it is by no means certain that all people weight these 2 general or 11 more particular facets of QOL the same, both are compromised by conventional LTC delivery. However these or other QOL domains are weighted and specified, arguably only the LTC consumers most concerned can report on their subjective experiences on these dimensions. With the ability to measure these constructs with the consumer as the source of data, an ability that can only improve with frequent, serious application, it becomes possible to study the characteristics of care programs, care providers, and care environments that support QOL outcomes and to test a wide variety of hypotheses about their interrelationships.People who need LTC are often compromised in their QOL by the very circumstances and conditions that necessitate the LTC in the first place. Taking another tack, Gubrium 1993    points out that individuals bring their own personality to their LTC experiences so that the identical experience from an objective viewpoint may be viewed positively or negatively by different people. Unfortunately, although considerable consensus has emerged on the major personality traits and how to measure them (Costa and McCrae 1997   ; John and Srivastava 1999   ), no personality measure has been well-tested in a frail, elderly population where self-completion may also not be an option. (This remains an important area of developmental research for gerontologists.) Finally, many researchers suggest that factors extraneous to formal LTC, such as the presence of caring friends and family, will have a strong effect on QOL. These points make skeptics doubt that LTC providers can improve or sustain QOL; however, if the circumstances of LTC can make life worse, surely they can also make life better. Despite the powerful forces of biology, personality, and luck of the social draw, there is ample evidence that the behavior of caregivers and the environments in which care is given can influence QOL for better or worse. LTC cannot promise a good life, but the challenge is to avoid foreclosing imaginative consideration of how a different vision of LTC could lead to a net improvement of QOL after controlling for other determining influences. Trends in LTC Five trends affecting LTC in the last decade form a context against which attention to QOL has a chance of yielding results: Disability Rights. The disability rights movement and the struggle of younger people with disabilities to receive care in the least restrictive environment was a prominent theme of the end of the 20th century, leading to and fueled by the Americans With Disability Act. The 1999 Supreme Court Olmstead decision asserted this right and, in an ambiguous ruling, enjoined states to develop plans for less restrictive care in care settings of the consumer's choice (Velgouse 2000   ). Whether older people will benefit much by this movement is in the hands of policy makers and other professionals, who would first need to conceptualize old people as having basic wishes similar to younger people. In part, it is also in the hands of older people with health needs, who would need to regard themselves as having a disability for which accommodations should be made.On the crest of the Olmstead wave, it may be possible to challenge waiting lists for home- and community-based care, and programs that distinguish the freedoms offered to people with disabilities on the basis of their age. The contrast between LTC for the young and the old is striking. Personal attendant services are designed to permit younger LTC consumers to go about their school, work, and leisure lives broadly in the community, whereas home care for elders requires a homebound status. Many care attendants help their younger clients move freely outside their homes, but the cardinal offense of an older person is to be away when the home care worker comes. This inequity of treatment is becoming clearer as some people have aged with a disability and experienced a sharp reduction in what is made possible by subsidized programs once they turn 65. Consumer-Directed and Consumer-Centered Care. Consumer-centered and consumer-directed care were slogans of the 1990s. This trend is manifested in Medicaid home- and community-based waiver programs that utilize "client-employed" workers; an evaluation of a large statewide consumer-directed home care program in California showed no untoward results because of the increased flexibility in the client-directed program, where about half of the hired caregivers are relatives of the consumers (Benjamin 1998   ). Another manifestation is the large-scale "cash and counseling demonstration" taking place now in three states, where the Medicaid benefit is cashed out for those who opt for a monetary though discounted benefit (Mahoney and Simon-Rusinowitz 1997   ). Many projects developed under the Robert Wood Johnson Initiative, "Independent Choices," including several that examine the applicability of consumer-directed care for elders with dementia via an agent or coach, test the boundaries of the concept; they include demonstration efforts to strengthen the infrastructure to make consumer-centered programs work better (e.g., training consumers to be more savvy employers, and developing emergency community-wide systems to access care when providers fail to show up). Models developed successfully in the developmental disability field, where the consumer is given a budget from which to draw (Nerney and Shumway 1996   ), have finally spread to some older people, despite the fear and trepidation of professionals who are entrusted with their well-being. Researchers who formerly studied case management and the allocation of services are now examining models of quality assurance that are truly consumer-focused, exploring ways to get the voice of the service user into the definition of quality at the front end and the reporting of it at the back end, and trying to determine how to balance prescriptive regulatory approaches with other ways of monitoring and improving quality. The chosen models must also work for people who can and wish to pay for the care themselves. By their licensing and quality assurance activities, state governments have enormous potential to shape LTC even for those who pay privately.A 2001 Institute of Medicine report on LTC quality explicitly recognizes the trend toward and interest in consumer-directed and consumer-centered care (Wunderlich & Kohler, 2001). It acknowledges that a consumer-centered approach would "necessitate a fundamental shift in the approach to determining and evaluating the quality" including "going beyond health and safety outcomes to include outcomes such as quality of life and autonomy" (p. 31). The report enunciates a cautious recommendation "to develop and fund a research agenda to investigate the potential quality impact associated with access to, and limitations of, different models of consumer-centered long-term care services, including consumer-directed services" (p. 18). A separate statement written by 7 of the 17 committee members states that "quality of life, as perceived by the long-term care consumer (or, when appropriate, his or her agent) is an essential part of the quality of long-term care" and recommends that "state governments work with providers and consumers to design and make available in each state an array of community-based long-term care options for individuals of all ages with long-term care needs" and that individual consumers "be afforded the opportunity to specify the degree of control and influence they are able to or wish to assume over the direction of their care" (p 289). Both the majority recommendation and the stronger view of the minority create an opportunity to usher community-centered approaches into the mainstream. That consumer-centered care was considered controversial illustrates the extent to which paternalism governs LTC policies and practices for older people; that it was considered so extensively or even at all in an Institute of Medicine report suggests a shift of attention and offers hope for progress.How quality is defined and quality outcomes are ordered are critically important. For example, consider an LTC consumer who, in the words of her obituary, died "at home with humor and dignity in her eightieth year." A photograph shows her propped up in her bed at home a few days before her death holding a whole lobster (of which she nibbled a few bites) and smiling broadly. She was surrounded by her family when she wanted them, was alone when she wanted to be, and had as much control as she wanted and was able to take. She also had a decubitus ulcer—the cardinal crime against LTC quality. If there were a database to track it, her care would likely have been considered a quality problem, yet according to the outcomes she most desired, the totality of her care had almost the best imaginable quality. A consumer-focused review of the quality of her LTC would give it high marks, whereas a more typical view would severely fault the decubitus ulcer, paying lip service to quality of life, but finding any poor physical outcomes to be intolerable. Assisted Living and the Unbundling of Housing and Services. The movement to new forms of housing with services, already alluded to, is a major phenomenon and a testimony to the choices of those who can vote with their wallets. Trends in housing with services, mapped every 2 years by Robert Mollica of the National Academy of State Health Policy, are unlikely to be turned back; as a conservative estimate from reporting states, in June 2000 almost 300,000 assisted living facilities served almost 800,000 residents, representing substantial growth from 2 years before (Mollica 2000   ). Moreover, 38 states covered such services under their Medicaid programs for people who qualified financially. A matter of compelling interest is whether it is possible for Medicaid to cover assisted living while maintaining the autonomy-enhancing and dignity-enhancing features that appeal to the private market; these may be dismissed as amenities that should not be offered to the poor. The idea that Medicaid programs should be undesirable to create disincentives for use dies hard. Yet, citizens using Medicaid for LTC are typically middle-class nursing home residents whose private resources have become exhausted by extreme old age and previous health and LTC expenditures. Like it or not, Medicaid is the mainstream funder on "public–private LTC partnerships."Assisted living offers a chance to positively alter the LTC landscape if it can combine three ingredients: a homelike residential environment, a true service capacity, and a philosophy of consumer choice, dignity, and normal lifestyle—all wrapped up in a package that middle-class and low-income people can afford, and public entities can afford to subsidize. In actuality, entities licensed as assisted living or other nonnursing home categories of residential care vary widely within and across states. Furthermore, as a review of literature, including goals expressed in trade literature and advertisements showed, some assisted living programs definitely aim for a light-care segment of the market (Manard, Cameron, and Kaplan 1996   ). Some advocates for elderly people and state regulators are grappling with how to channel this market phenomenon, ensuring its safety and quality while preserving the attributes that make it desirable. Once again, the lack of societal consensus on LTC plays out in disagreements about what governments should do about assisted living. Research is beginning to show that some people with conditions that could well be served in nursing homes are now in other kinds of residential settings, and some research findings suggest their outcomes are comparable or better than those of nursing home residents (Frytak, Kane, Finch, Kane, and Maude-Griffin 2001   ). The presence of so many people with substantial levels of disability in assisted living settings creates "facts on the ground." Either residents must be asked to move out when their disabilities reach a certain point, or assisted living providers must be able to provide reasonable levels of care within the context of what one hopes will be improved living circumstances. Once the principle of separating housing and board conceptually from care and services is established, the details can be worked out about how the services might be constructed and the kinds of outcomes for which assisted living providers are responsible. Culture Change in Nursing Homes. As suggested earlier, some nursing homes are committed to changing in ways that enhance quality of life. Many of these efforts center around the Pioneer Network in Long-Term Care, formerly the Nursing Home Pioneers, a loosely organized grouping of providers and others who are dedicated to exemplifying in practice the following values: responding to the spirit as well as the mind and body needs; putting persons before tasks; seeking to enjoy residents and staff as unique individuals; acting on the belief that as staff are treated so will residents be treated; beginning decision making with the resident; and accepting risk taking as a normal part of adult life (Fagan et al. 1997   ). The Pioneers embrace a wide variety of activities that accord with these general principles. Among them are practitioners of the Eden Alternative for combating boredom, loneliness, and lack of meaning in nursing homes, which itself is a social movement (Thomas 1994   , Thomas 1999   ). Also included are a variety of more localized efforts in individual nursing homes and even whole corporations to break down the rigidities of routines, to foster more normal and natural relationships between residents and staff, to include residents in decision making (even to the point of, in one example, including residents on personnel committees), to permit spontaneity, to foster neighborhood grouping of residents; to include individualized end-of-life care and rituals to mark death, and to empower both residents and certified nursing assistants. The efforts also include approaches to transform daily experiences of bathing and meals into enjoyable rituals rather than, as often perceived now, torture (Rader 1995   ). The Pioneers are struggling with the joint challenges of creating genuine community when feasible and permitting room for individual lives as well. Like any social movement, progress is expected to be painstakingly slow and difficult, and the quest for a quick fix needs to be resisted (Dannefer 2000   ).The ideas of the Pioneer Network are hardly novel, just hard to implement. Nursing home administrator Herbert Shore, whose life was remembered at a memorial service at the 2000 meeting of The Gerontological Society of America, characterized the needs and desires of the older consumer in a 1970 report to his board (Shore 1970   ):Older people need security—economically (in terms of shelter, housing, and spending money), physically (in terms of medical care and adequate diet), and socially (in terms of status, friendship and belonging). Older people want recognition—for what they can do mentally and manually, for their capacity to make a contribution to their community, country and world, for social and political consciousness, and their ability to plan for themselves. Older people want response: to be liked for what they are, to hold friends and make new acquaintances; and older people want new experiences and adventures: to continue to learn and grow and develop, to enjoy the new and different, to extend interests, expand horizons, satisfy curiosity, to create for expression in artistic and aesthetic areas. They need to relax. They need freedom, dignity and respect. They can fall in love, be deeply hurt, and can be extremely happy. Like every other human being, they need social contact. (From a compilation of writing of Herbert Shore prepared in his memory by Elma Holder, National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, Washington, DC.)In that 30-year-old report, Shore also suggested that if staff are to give, "they need to be secure in self, gain satisfaction in giving, and must receive recognition, love, and compensation." He deplored "cultural hangups on who does what"—a precursor of the universal worker ideas of today. In a column notable for quoting both Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Thomas Aquinas on the same page, his denouement stated: "… the major challenge is to provide for a continuity of life experience (no showcase for public relations, not tokenism but meaningful life—with freedom of choice, when and if to participate, a program of social health, personal identity, independence, privacy, stability self-direction, re-engagement, discovery and re-institution of normal elements of daily social living." These principles are almost identical to those of the Pioneer Network in the year 2000. The key in both instances is refusing to let LTC take over life itself or to place LTC consumers outside the full range of human needs and interests. Attention to Physical Environments. Long ago Lawton pointed out the importance of physical environments in shaping competence—and the need for environments that minimize stress but create press—or stimulation and interest (Lawton and Nahemow 1973   ). Rudolph Moos has mapped out strategies to assess environments in exquisite detail, but until recently little has been done to "normalize" physical environments as well as to adapt them to enhance functional opportunities (Moos and Lemke 1996   ). We are still, tragically, building brand new nursing homes in this country with double-loaded corridors and shared rooms and baths, and many experts fail to take seriously the importance of mandating a threshold of private rooms and baths even in assisted living. But on the positive side, currently there is unprecedented interest in physical design of living quarters for care, as well as specialized furnishings, fixtures, and equipment to enhance functioning. Long overdue attention is being paid to chairs, switches, knobs, fabrics, colors, and materials. One well-publicized large facility has been completely rebuilt to move "from hallways to households" of 8 to 10 residents who enjoy a residential-style large kitchen, a dining area, their own washers and dryers, and living space (Dannefer 2000   ).In our own work, we have begun and hope to be able to do more to empirically link the details of physical design with quality-of-life outcomes. Minute aspects of the physical environment can, we believe, be associated with better or worse outcomes on the full range of quality-of-life domains that we have discussed. For example, in facilities without bathrooms accessible to residents at their front door, near their dining and activity rooms and in other strategic places, residents are likely to cleave to their rooms. In facilities without mirrors at wheelchair height, residents cannot groom themselves. In fact, assisted living facilities have managed to enhance the functional abilities of their residents through environmental supports such as roll-in showers and well designed kitchenettes. Strategies for Change Develop Infrastructure With Attention to Unit Prices. Subversive ideas, also known as fresh thinking, must be encouraged, including changing professional roles, breaking down boundaries of organizations, and considering delegation of nursing roles. Similar creativity is needed in considering how states can best exercise their two roles: paying for care for people with low incomes, and defining the nature of care through licensing rules. If nursing homes are changed from inside, and assisted living and home care combinations are developed as well, we may reach a point when all the conventional categories are questioned. Certainly it would be helpful to stop confounding the place of care with the intensity or level of care. Professionals should desist from making hierarchical decisions about "appropriate levels." Ideals of continuum should give way to ideals of a repertoire of choices with recognition that choices are plausible based on consumer's values and circumstances. Advocates for older people should seize on the Olmstead decision and embrace the Americans With Disability Act as a vehicle for making affordable solutions possible in real communities. Develop Sources of Information for Consumers. Even as we break down boundaries across service sectors, consumers need some dictionary or index to understand the new forms of LTC. Federal regulation of assisted living is premature and may never be indicated, but surely nomenclature needs to be clear enough that consumers can shop and researchers can study outcomes with some certainty that they are comparing apples and apples. Develop Feedback Mechanisms for Providers. Quality improvement calls for information about quality—including the quality that consumers care about most, that is, the elements that enhance or detract from quality of life. Information is needed at the macro level to characterize the work of provider organizations and the microlevel of an individual consumer of LTC. Providers also need to learn how to discuss quality-of-life issues with consumers and use that information to improve services.A corollary of improving information for providers and policy makers is to work toward comparable information across settings. This is a difficult methodological problem with political overtones. Decisions need to be made, for example, about how to treat functional abilities. Should researchers exclude information about consumers' IADL functioning, self-medication, and bathing independence to create a level playing field given that nursing home residents are often prohibited from independence on these spheres? Conversely, should researchers include such information on the basis that superior consumer functioning may result from the policies and physical environments of the less regulated settings? Also, how should baseline performance be regarded when settings are compared? Assisted living residents function better at baseline, not because they are in better health, but because the environment permits them to function better. We may understate the accomplishments of assisted living and home care by using ADL and IADL abilities at baseline to case-mix-adjust samples, making it appear that alternate settings select less frail people. Finally, as both a methodological and political matter, the quality-of-life outcomes that have been stressed here largely must be measured by report of the LTC consumers concerned; yet, a huge investment has already been made in a nationwide assessment tool for nursing home residents, the Minimum Data System, which largely excludes these outcomes and that gathers data by ratings by care providers' ratings. There is a great incentive to move this tool to home care and assisted living so that LTC consumers can be compared across settings, yet doing so may leave the field with an inadequate yardstick to examine relative progress in quality of life either within nursing homes or across settings. Create Supportive Environments. It is axiomatic that shared rooms and baths should be decommissioned and old facility stock no longer be replaced with more of the same; whether to do this should no longer be a research question. Research and demonstration of other ways that environmental features can enhance functioning is sorely needed, however. Also needed is better access to specialized equipment (from phones and computers to prosthetic aides to furnishings). Supportive environments also include transportation for those who cannot drive or readily use public transportation, including those who have relocated into new congregate living settings.A caveat is also in order. There is certainly a danger of romanticizing the fact of being at home, and ignoring the isolation that older people, especially those living alone, can experience in the community. There is also a danger in assuming that everyone values private space equally; though the empirical evidence for this preference crosses age, ethnicity, and social class boundaries, individual differences can also be found within samples of older people on their relative preferences for privacy, and for autonomy versus protection. Moreover, loneliness and isolation are experienced in back bedrooms where seniors receive home care and also in shared rooms in nursing homes. The challenge is to try to maximize the sense of privacy that many people see as part and parcel of a good quality of life as well as other domains such as meaningful activity, enjoyment, and relationships. Accept Risk. Nothing is perfect, and accidents happen. In the words of the Pioneer Network, risk is a normal part of adult life. This stance requires consideration in advance about how to balance outcomes. The concept of managed risk contracting (sometimes called negotiated risk contracting), whereby informed consumers or their agents can accept risks, is worthy of study and true implementation. At this point some nursing home leaders, many assisted living leaders, and some home care case managers and state officials are discussing managed risk. In some states, it is embodied in assisted living or broader LTC regulations. To implement such a strategy, providers need clear messages that they will not be punished for untoward events; also, we need to build in mechanisms to prevent abuse of caregiving responsibilities in the name of freedom for consumers. Take Back the System. LTC for older people needs to be discussed in new ways with attention to the hopes and fears of all parties, including providers, advocates, well older people, and older people getting care and their families. Discussion is needed about the circumstances under which older people could better tolerate their more physically and even cognitively impaired age-cohort peers in their midst, and whether such acceptance would be a reasonable tradeoff for confidence that nobody would be relegated to substandard quality of life as their care needs increased. All parties to such discussions should freely consider their own personal and family experiences and preferences along with relevant research to help focus the inquiry on important human and social values.We also need to consider deeply what constitutes a reasonable quality of life for people with dementia. One is likely to be considered naive or quixotic to recommend a more normal system of life and care for people who have lost cognitive capability and whose function is anything but normal. The urge is to protect, to regiment, and to sequester such individuals. But LTC is ordinary life, and people with dementia live among us as part of family units and communities. A few years ago, at a 60th wedding anniversary party, I noted with satisfaction that several members of the original wedding party with visible Alzheimer's disease were guests at the event and involved to the best of their abilities.LTC discussions should begin by considering how citizens believe people with physical and cognitive disability should and want to live in their old age. Mechanisms are needed for encouraging problem solving. Perhaps neutral parties, such as universities, could convene all interested stakeholders to discuss how to avert the tragedies of the next double-roomed nursing home, the next program that narrowly limits services to people under 65, or the next rule that is designed to help with quality but actually drives up costs beyond most people's ability to pay. A gerontological research agenda should be developed to explore how well various new models of LTC work, to take the preference pulse of consumers, and to explore the fears that are held about the mishaps that might occur on the road to a better form of LTC. Sheer advocacy may be needed, but needed also are the powerful research questions that move us ahead. The litmus test must continue to be normal, ordinary life coexisting with LTC. In all reform, including financing, we must keep our eye on the quality-of-life ball, or the game is lost.An earlier version of this article was delivered as the Donald P. Kent Memorial Lecture at the Annual Scientific Meeting of The Gerontological Society of America in Washington, DC, on November 20, 2000. Much of the conceptual work for the article was performed under a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Investigator Award for Health Policy Research. The discussion of quality-of-life domains is based on work performed under a contract with the Health Care Financing Administration. I acknowledge the particular contributions to the thinking in this article that were offered by colleagues, especially M. Powell Lawton, Richard C. Ladd, Robert L. Kane, and Keren Brown Wilson.

     To establish a context, long-term care (LTC) can be provided either through institutions or in the community; can include both formal (i.e., generally paid and often specialized) and informal (i.e., generally unpaid and often unspecialized) care; and that formal care can have either public or private funding. Within this context, a fundamental conceptual structure for addressing the topic of what works and what does not in formal community long-term care (CLTC) might be reduced to four components:Who gets something?What do they get?Who pays?What impact does it have?Concerning who receives formal CLTC, we often have two subgroups. The first subgroup of formal CLTC users comprises those who are certified by their state officials as functionally eligible for institutional LTC. These users are often assumed to represent a type of substitution of home- and community-based services for traditional nursing home care. This assumption of substitution persists, although for at least 25 years it has been documented that there are two or three older people with the same configuration of needs and disablements living in the community for every one person residing in a nursing home (Branch 1976   , Branch 1977   , Branch 1980   ), and gerontological researchers have yet to understand clearly why the one person enters the nursing home and the other two or three do not. Those CLTC users who meet nursing home admission requirements may not represent substitution at all.The second subgroup of CLTC users comprises those whose frailty is substantial but not severe enough to qualify for state-funded nursing home care. The second subgroup is actually expanding the continuum of LTC clients.The clients of CLTC have not always behaved predictably, however. There have been more than a few examples where the potential clients of an innovative CLTC demonstration simply declined to enroll. In some of these instances, the potential CLTC client had been approved by the intake worker as appropriate for the innovative program based on their frailty, there was no out-of-pocket payment required of the client, and yet the client declined to enroll. Why? Why are clients declining to participate in some of our alternative CLTC programs? Solving this riddle should help gerontological researchers to understand better who the clients of CLTC are and whom they should be.Concerning the second issue, what do CLTC clients receive as services, the short answer is that across all the communities they receive a full continuum of care, but within specific communities there are often gaps in the continuum of care. A continuum of care generally includes acute medical services (e.g., inpatient care, outpatient care, emergency care, primary care, specialty care, rehabilitative care, and skilled therapies at home), long-term care services (e.g., institutional nursing home care, community adult day treatment centers, respite care, community nutrition sites, community recreational and educational senior centers, home-delivered meals, home health aides, homemaker care, personal care attendants for assistance with activities of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs], and generic home care), social services (assistance with Medicare and Medicaid forms, assistance with tax forms, and various opportunities for socialization), housing services (assisted living options, board-and-care options, senior independent living options, and subsidized housing). Evashwick 2000    has written an excellent and expanded perspective on the continuum of care.An issue related to understanding these components in the continuum of CLTC is understanding who provides such care—formal sources or informal sources. In general, about three out of four frail community-dwelling elders rely solely on informal sources (e.g., family and friends) for support, while most of the others rely on a combination of family care and paid assistance (Liu, Manton, and Liu 1985   ). In trying to meet unmet needs for CLTC, most would agree that the policy goal should be to encourage formal sources to complement informal sources, not substitute for them. Agreement on the implementation of this policy goal has been elusive, however.What are the weak links in the continuum of care? A lack of structure to facilitate a seamless continuum of care, a lack of information readily available to potential users of CLTC and their informal support network to construct their own continuum, and a lack of professional support to construct and/or manage a continuum of services as appropriate. If a person is frail enough to need a variety of these CLTC services, then he or she is probably too frail to overcome a structure that is not user friendly, too frail to find difficult-to-obtain information, and too frail to manage and coordinate the components of their care effectively.Concerning the third issue, who pays for CLTC services, the old stalwarts of Medicare and Medicaid are the primary sources of public moneys for CLTC. A recent summary of expenditures for formal LTC during 2000 indicated that Medicaid paid about 40% of all bills, Medicare about 20% (with half going to nursing homes and half going to home care), and out-of-pocket payments accounting for most of the remaining 40%, with some augmentation by state general funds in some cases (e.g., Maine, Massachusetts, and New York). The problem, of course, is that Medicare was established to pay for hospital and hospital-related care for its beneficiaries, and while over time there have been some inclusions of institutional and community LTC as covered services, it only pays for about 20% of such services. Medicaid, on the other hand, was established with the broader mandate to pay for all health care of its beneficiaries, but its beneficiaries are limited to those in poverty as defined by their state of residence. Certainly many older people are also poor by the Medicaid criteria of their state, but the tragedy is that they often had to spend down their income and assets by paying out of pocket for health care in order to become eligible for Medicaid. The implication of both the limited Medicare coverage and the requirement for impoverishment to receive Medicaid services is that much of the CLTC is paid out of pocket by the user and/or provided by the informal (and generally unpaid) support system.Concerning the fourth issue, what impact does it have, it is worth remembering that the desired outcomes of CLTC vary widely. In the more traditional fields of clinical epidemiology, health services outcomes research, and cost-effectiveness research, the traditional outcomes of mortality, morbidity, and costs predominate. For CLTC, I suggest that there are at least eight appropriate outcomes to monitor and use as the basis for quality assurance. Borrowing on previous work by Lohr 1988   , these are:Death—First make sure that no unnecessary serious harm is occurring.Disease—Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of diseases is essential; secondary prevention would include optimal control of chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.Dollars—Everything else equal, the treatment or services should not cost more than traditional alternatives (but I would contend that an alternative of not providing any services or treatment is not acceptable).Disability—The physical function of the CLTC client is extremely important; sometimes just slowing an expected downward trajectory is a favorable outcome.Depression—The emotional function of the CLTC client is also extremely important, and emotional dysfunction may have atypical presentation in older CLTC clients.Disorientation—The client's cognitive function can be the primary concern of some CLTC programs, and its importance should be recognized.Discomfort—The pain that a CLTC client endures can be both an important outcome and an indicator of quality care.Dissatisfaction—The client is the ultimate consumer, and consumer satisfaction is a legitimate outcome in CLTC (albeit extremely difficult to measure reliably and validly); a surrogate indicator of dissatisfaction may be disenrollment, which represents an extreme expression of dissatisfaction; the satisfaction of the CLTC client's family can also be as important as the satisfaction of the client.Each of these domains represents an important outcome in CLTC, and therefore can serve as the basis for monitoring the quality of CLTC services. But who should do the monitoring – the person paying the bills for the services or the person receiving the service? In the simpler model of most consumer transactions in a market economy, the payer and the receiver of services are the same person, and that person monitors quality with backup assistance from consumer protection agencies on rare occasions. In the CLTC model (and with most of health care in general), the payer and the receiver of services are two different entities, and so the question of who should do the monitoring is not always obvious. For outcomes like satisfaction and pain, it is obvious that the recipient of services has to be involved in if not in charge of these components of quality assurance. Other outcomes may not be as clear, but ignoring quality assurance is not an appropriate option.In summary, knowing what works and what does not in community long-term care can be facilitated by having a structure to guide the innovations and the evaluations.

     Laurence G. Branch, PhDDiscovering what works in home care begins with asking the right questions. Two principles from the evaluation research field are useful in understanding what results should be expected of home care: First, examination of program activities may be the key to discovering program objectives (Deutscher 1977   ); second, evidence of immediate effects of programs is much more likely to be found than evidence of less proximate effects (Rossi, Freeman, and Lipsey 1999   ). Therefore, to understand what home care is likely to accomplish, we should start by examining the specific tasks involved in home care and focus on immediately achievable program objectives.The core set of home care activities consists of personal assistance services intended to compensate for self-care limitations largely as reflected in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) measures. Home care does for those with self-care limitations what they cannot do for themselves. More specifically, home care provides assistance with bathing, dressing, meal preparation, shopping, and so on for those who cannot perform these tasks independently. The immediate aim of personal assistance, therefore, is to assure that recipients have adequate solutions to challenges of daily living (Caro 1981   ). I have come to use the term "quality of circumstances" to describe largely objective measures of the adequacy of solutions to problems of daily living. (I avoid the term "quality of life" because it is typically conceived of as an entirely subjective construct.) Some examples of quality-of-circumstance content may be helpful. In the quality-of-circumstance framework, a highly favorable outcome for assistance with mobility is evidence that the recipient moves around in the living environment at will day and night with full access to all rooms in the residence and does so without experiencing injury. For those whose home care addresses inability to prepare meals, the quality-of-circumstance framework documents eating experiences from both a nutritional and enjoyment perspective. The nutritional aspect includes weight gain or loss, dietary balance, quantity of food available, and frequency of eating opportunities. Enjoyment of the eating experience includes the social context, satisfaction with the types and variety of food available, and satisfaction with the eating environment. For those who are unable to shop, the adequacy of assistance with shopping is measured by how fully the household is supplied with regularly needed items and how rapidly missing items are obtained. The quality-of-circumstance framework has content that corresponds to each ADL and IADL item. In addition, it includes other dimensions such as shelter adequacy, privacy, autonomy, and activity (Caro, Gottlieb, and Safran-Norton 2000   ).Formal home care often has a second dimension in that it supplements the efforts of informal caregivers. A second aim of home care, then, should be to provide relief to informal caregivers (Caro 1981   ).The approach proposed here deliberately side-steps the conventional argument that the aim of publicly funded home care is to prevent nursing home placement. Prevention of nursing home placement is usually a desirable outcome for home care, but it is a risky basis for judging the efficacy of home care because of the lack of close proximity between the provision of formal home care services and nursing home placement. Because many forces influence nursing home placements, the effects of formal home care in preventing or delaying nursing home placement can be swamped by the effects of other, more powerful forces. Further, formal home care is appropriate for many who are not immediate candidates for nursing home placement. For these reasons, evidence of nursing home avoidance should be considered a bonus for home care rather than the fundamental basis upon which the contributions of services are judged.Does a framework that focuses on solutions to problems of daily living let home care off the accountability hook too easily? By no means! The key to accountability for home care is the adequacy of the solutions to daily living needs that it provides. The evaluation issue for home care, then, is largely one of quality: Is the quality of the solutions to problems of daily living achieved through home care sufficient to meet a standard of adequacy? We then need to ask how quality is defined and how a standard of adequacy is established. Consumers, informal caregivers, providers, and those who provide the financing may have different ideas about both quality and standards of adequacy. When we know the extent to which home care improves the quality of daily living experiences, we can introduce efficiency considerations. We can also ask whether some strategies are more efficient than others in achieving comparable gains in the quality of solutions to problems of daily living.Quality of circumstances is not the only immediate objective that has been proposed for home care. "Reducing unmet needs" is an important example of an immediate outcome measure that has been used successfully in home care research. In the Channeling demonstrations, for example, formal home care services led to reductions in unmet needs (Kemper 1988   ). Like quality of circumstances, the unmet needs framework focuses on ADL and IADL domains. In some applications, evaluators simply calculate the proportion of identified needs that receive attention. Other studies distinguish between needs that are "partially met" and those that are "fully met."The major advantage of the quality-of-circumstance approach over the "meeting needs" formulation is political. Quality of circumstances offers a positive language for presenting favorable outcomes of home care services, that is, quality of circumstances is formulated to offer evidence of the extent to which home care improves the lives of recipients. The home care field may be more successful in capturing public imagination and public resources when it presents evidence of "improving lives" than when it demonstrates that it "reduces unmet needs."Quality of circumstances also tackles issues that are frequently ambiguous in formulations that focus on "meeting needs." Most important, quality of circumstances operationalizes what it means to "meet needs." Moreover, to the extent feasible, it does so objectively. Quality of circumstances also specifies explicit gradations in how well daily living challenges are addressed. Further, quality of circumstances invites attention to the basis upon which quality standards are based, including both community standards and preferences of home care recipients. For gerontologists who prefer to work with the language of "meeting needs," these refinements are also feasible and desirable. Gradations in the degree to which needs are met can be measured. Distinctions can be made between need as seen by home care recipients and need as reflected by community norms. Standards can also be established that specify how fully public programs should be expected to meet needs.Questions about the effects of formal home care services upon caregiver burden deserve similar consideration. The introduction of formal home care services does not assure a reduction in informal caregiver effort, because caregivers may simply shift their efforts to other tasks, including the supervision of formal services. In the case of publicly funded programs, the questions about impact on caregivers invite attention to standards. Should public programs be expected simply to provide a level of relief that caregivers find satisfactory? Alternately, should there be a standard of the effort expected of informal caregivers? If so, formal home care services could be evaluated on the extent to which they reduce or eliminate "greater-than-expected" caregiving effort (Caro 1981   ).Is the quality-of-circumstance approach too difficult for home care to absorb? Two challenges are involved; both can be overcome. The first is a matter of conceptualization and language. With concerted effort, the field can shift its statement of mission to one that focuses on improvement in the life experiences of people with disabilities. The second issue is technical. I believe that case managers are able to move beyond identifying and addressing the "unmet needs" approach to service planning to one in which they also focus on strategies necessary to enable clients to achieve explicit improvements in their life circumstances. Further, researchers are capable of employing largely objective measures of how well daily living needs are met (Caro and Blank 1988   ). In addition, we have both technical and political methods for establishing standards for the quality of daily living experiences that we should expect of formal home care services.

     Laurence G. Branch, PhDFor five years, we have been the national program office for the Home Care Research Initiative, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded program that supports research and analysis intended to improve the knowledge base underlying policies affecting home- and community-based services (HCBS). The initiative has aimed at developing knowledge about more effective strategies for allocating dollars, targeting services, and promoting delivery system efficiency in order to expand access to high-quality HCBS. In our efforts to make the findings of our commissioned work readily accessible to the policy-making community, we have experimented with a number of dissemination strategies and have come to appreciate the complexity of tailoring information for use by different policy audiences.Thus, we decided to explore the issue of dissemination more systematically, by talking with state long-term care (LTC) policy makers about their research information needs and looking at the activities of groups that actively communicate LTC information (see  Appendix , Note 1). We supplemented this "environmental scan" by convening a group of LTC researchers and policy makers to discuss our findings. This forum article reports on the lessons and recommendations that emerged from this process and makes the case—based on the interviews and discussions reported herein—for support of information "brokers" to synthesize, translate, and disseminate important policy-relevant findings for LTC.The difficulty of communicating complex evidence-based information to policy makers has generated a substantial literature, too voluminous to review in this short discussion piece. One of the classics in the field (Weiss 1977   ), written nearly 25 years ago, remains applicable today. Even before the current "information revolution," government staff reported that they were "awash in information, particularly when … undertaking a new initiative." Thus, their job is "to cut through the mass of information and make sense of it" (Weiss 1989   , p. 429). Effective techniques for communicating research findings to decision makers also are described in the literature. These include presenting readily understandable, timely data in visually compelling formats, using illustrative anecdotes where appropriate, sending clear key messages about the meaning of data, suggesting ways to use research findings for answering important policy questions, and establishing relationships of trust and credibility with policy makers and media experts (Coburn 1998   ; Lomas 2000   ; Roos and Shapiro 1999   ; Tufte 1983   ).Yet, our environmental scan provides evidence that in LTC—as in other applied research fields—the lessons taught by this literature have not been well absorbed. Undoubtedly, the problems of research dissemination in LTC are exacerbated by the fragmented state of the research community and the limited resources available for both research and dissemination activities—problems that affect all aspects of the field, not just dissemination activities. Despite this lack of resources, this article aims to encourage those in the field of LTC to take the task of information dissemination seriously, both to communicate more effectively within the resource constraints that currently exist and to encourage increased investment in research brokering activities for the future. Methods Environmental Scan The focus of the scan was on the accessibility of research-based information for state LTC policy making. Its purpose was to identify critical gaps in knowledge from the perspective of state policy makers and researchers and to assess the role of information brokers in translating and disseminating research findings for use in policy making. The scan was guided by four primary research questions:What types of research can/do state policy makers draw on for strategic policy development?What are the critical gaps in knowledge from the perspective of LTC researchers and policy makers?Who is doing the information brokering? What makes for an effective information broker?What actions could be taken to better address the research production and research translation/dissemination needs of state LTC policy makers?The principal data sources for the scan consisted of (1) a set of semi-structured individual and group interviews, supplemented by limited follow-up interviews to clarify particular points; and (2) a literature review and web search to identify relevant articles and LTC policy information products. The purpose of the interviews was to capture the perceptions of information users, information producers, and information brokers—organizations or individuals devoted principally to translating and disseminating information. The purpose of the literature review and web search was to compare the products created by brokers with policy maker's perceptions of available research and to better understand the missions and activities of the broad range of organizations translating and disseminating research findings.From September through November 2000, we conducted 34 individual interviews with a convenience sample consisting of: (1) senior state LTC policy makers (e.g., from Medicaid and Aging agencies); (2) individuals from constituent organizations representing policy makers (e.g., the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of State Units on Aging); (3) LTC researchers from both universities and nonuniversity-based organizations that conduct policy analyses and serve as information resources for policy makers; and (4) representatives of organizations or programs whose primary mission is the dissemination of evidence-based policy-relevant information to the policy-making community (e.g., the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's User Liaison Program, the Academy for Health Services Research and Health Policy). We also conducted a group discussion with six researchers in LTC and a number of supplementary interviews to clarify particular points. The interviews lasted, on average, between 45 and 60 minutes. (A full list of individuals participating in the survey can be obtained from the first author.) Conference In December 2000, we shared a draft paper summarizing the results of the environmental scan with a group of 34 LTC researchers and policy makers who attended the annual meeting of the Home Care Research Initiative. In three plenary sessions and a set of smaller breakout groups, the conference participants reviewed, questioned, and amplified the findings of the scan. They also outlined a variety of practical strategies for addressing problems or issues identified, discussed barriers to achieving those strategies, and proposed ways to overcome them. This article incorporates the input of the conference members. Issues Acquiring and Conveying LTC Information Our interviews and discussions uncovered some important lessons on how state policy makers acquire information and on how information brokers might more effectively convey the findings of LTC research ( Table 1  ). These lessons reinforce the insights gained from other explorations of the use of research and analysis by decision makers in different fields (Albaek 1995   ; Greenberg, Mandell, and Onstott 1995   ; Lomas 2000   ; Roos and Shapiro 1999   ; Shulock 1999   ; Weiss 1977   , Weiss 1989   ; see  Appendix , Note 2). First, policy makers seek and prefer to use information obtained directly from trusted sources, preferably from sources with immediate knowledge of their state's circumstances, priorities, and needs. The substance of such information is generally perceived as more convincing and more readily applicable to current or anticipated policy problems than "undigested" information obtained from the academic literature. Second, effective dissemination is not simply about format and packaging; translation of research findings is also key. This means that findings must be presented in clear language that is free of research "jargon." Furthermore, effective translation requires that researchers think through and articulate unambiguously the policy implications of their work. Researchers who would influence policy makers must recognize that preliminary but timely results are more likely to have an impact than more definitive findings published long after a policy must be formulated or a program implemented. Finally, effective communication recognizes the glut of information facing policy makers and the lack of time they have to digest it.Of course, policy makers differ, both in their personal preferences regarding the types of information they find useful and in the level of resources they can apply to collecting and interpreting information. They differ, too, in their sense of what types of information work best within their individual states and for specific policy purposes. These differences certainly matter. Nonetheless, some strong themes emerged from our interviews. "Local" sources are most trusted by state policy makers, in part because their information is more readily applicable. Over half of the policy makers interviewed responded to our question about information sources by referring first to information generated from within their state. One policy maker did not cite a single source of information that was not local, except for policy makers from other states. Another said, "often the research we do, and use, is our own. Nothing works better with legislators and others than local, current information." Two other respondents commented on the general distrust of data evinced by politicians in their respective states. One said, "our state is leadership-driven, not empirically driven," whereas another said, "we're not very data-driven"—yet both explicitly excepted their respective state's internal information and data sources from the general level of political skepticism. Others cited consumer input, provider groups, and planning committees as sources of information that were important to them. The fact that this information is local is what makes it so convincingly relevant; this type of information has little or no need to be translated to reflect the state's circumstances. Furthermore, because the source is well known by both policy makers and those they need to persuade, the accuracy of such information is more likely to be trusted. Peers and experts are also preferred information sources. When asked where they went for information on LTC, many state policy makers said they rely on informal contacts with peers—that is, policy makers in similar positions in other states—or a handful of nationally renowned experts in the field. This propensity to rely on informal information sources is a result of a combination of needs: the need to trust the source; the need to cut through the information glut; and the need to obtain information that is tailored to respondents' circumstances. For example, the peers considered most useful were those who struggle with problems similar to those faced by the respondent, rather than those from "model" states; similarity of circumstance ensures that the information provided is relevant. Peers also provide information shortcuts—why research a topic when a peer might have the information at hand? This need to use shortcuts also explains the reliance on selected leaders in the field who are researchers with national reputations or individuals who can readily link up respondents with other reliable information sources, as researchers from the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) often do. In particular, policy makers appreciate the expertise of researchers who speak plainly and make themselves available to work directly with policy makers to meet the needs of their particular state. Poorly translated information is not often used. Researchers and policy makers do not generally speak the same professional language. As one of our conference participants observed, "researchers are from Mars; policy makers are from Venus." In both their written and verbal communications, LTC researchers are apt to speak the language of "independent" and "dependent variables," "error," "variance," "interaction terms," "endogeneity," "selection bias," "quality-adjusted life years," and the like. On the other hand, LTC policy makers in the executive branch of government are preoccupied with Medicaid waiver slots, "administrative match," "state only" programs, Olmstead provisions, and the like. Elected politicians, in turn, tend to focus on "doing what voters want," which, according to one respondent, consists principally of avoiding institutionalization—the "ultimate bad LTC outcome." Legislators' sensitivity to multidimensional LTC outcomes is minimal and their interest is even less. No wonder, then, that policy makers thinking about changes to their state's LTC system do not rely heavily on research reports produced by academic researchers or published in academic journals. Undigested LTC research is reportedly used most often if a state has dedicated staff who can devote time to culling the research literature and applying it to their own policy analyses.Policy makers report frustration with researchers' unwillingness to articulate clearly the policy implications of their research—to "go out on a limb" and make policy recommendations based on their findings. These criticisms were not limited to publications in academic journals, but included many of the products generated by think tanks, government organizations, and policy centers (notable exceptions were the products of the General Accounting Office and AARP, which were universally praised). Policy makers do acknowledge the importance of well conducted research and even understand researchers' need to produce the "best" research possible. However, they also emphasize their need for timely information (one said, "we know we will always be acting on imperfect information") and encourage researchers to be more forthcoming with preliminary results. Policy makers strongly prefer information that is concise, current, hits the main points, discusses the implications of research findings, and contains information that enables them to follow up if interested. Research that meets academic standards was criticized on the grounds that it is not timely, its format is inappropriate, and its relevance to policy makers' needs is not clear. It was complained that information in most research publications tends to be dense, with the findings hidden in the text. Policy makers' views on printed information sources are very consistent. Format and timeliness are essential. "Optics are paramount," noted one policy maker. If the format is a research brief, it should be short and contain simple, clear graphics that can be used without alteration. Products that meet these requirements were highly rated and, according to our respondents, actually used. On the other hand, respondents reported that they rarely use the web because finding information is too time-consuming, and the information found is rarely exactly what is wanted. Web searches are delegated, if possible. Conferences are a pr eferred means of obtaining information. This finding is not surprising, given policy makers' preference for information from trusted, informal sources and their need to use shortcuts to navigate through information overload. The conferences that were praised, however, were the smaller, more focused conferences. In particular, respondents noted the importance of restricting attendance to "good people." They also liked conferences that helped them look ahead to anticipate upcoming problems and alert them to possible policy responses. Many of the larger, more well-known conferences were avoided because they focus too much on programmatic or operational issues, rather than on strategic planning or conceptual issues. Policy Makers' Substantive Research Needs When we asked policy makers about the areas where they felt research was lacking in LTC, they most frequently expressed the desire for data on "what other states are doing." Policy makers want to be able to compare their state with others; to do so, they need both data that allow comparisons to be made and a framework for making comparisons. They also value evaluations that show "what works and what doesn't work." Reliable and timely quantitative data that will allow valid and ongoing cross-state comparisons of LTC service use and expenditures are generally perceived as necessary but lacking. Policy makers also want to be updated on other kinds of comparative information, such as systems changes that are being implemented or are under discussion in other states, information that is not typically the result of academic research. Such information falls into several categories: descriptive program information, technical information, referrals to other information sources, and news about state practices, legislative changes, and other events that might affect the demand for or supply of LTC services.Many of these policy makers' information needs reflect the importance they place on anticipating the future. For example, many policy makers listed workforce issues among the important areas where research needs to be done, along with needs for information about other demographic parameters likely to affect the supply and demand for LTC, such as the future availability of informal support. Other key issues were the development of housing opportunities for people needing HCBS, with particular interest in a host of issues related to promoting, regulating, and measuring quality of life and quality of care in assisted living facilities and related settings. Several policy makers said they needed research on how to respond lawfully to the Olmstead decision.Other information needs are persistent and apparently enduring. For example, policy makers said they need research that addresses the cost-effectiveness of HCBS. They also want help in developing, structuring, and managing HCBS and often requested research on the efficacy of particular tools to help them do this—such as assessment tools and quality indicators. In particular, they expressed interest in research on different ways of integrating care, whether this be through capitation or other managed care mechanisms. Research on effective methods to keep people out of nursing homes was another favorite topic, as was the question of how to increase consumer choice in HCBS. Few policy makers expressed interest in research on LTC insurance, reflecting, perhaps, the failure of Congress to extend to states not participating in the original "Partnership for Long-Term Care" permission to relax Medicaid spend-down requirements for purchasers of private LTC insurance (see  Appendix , Note 3). The Brokering Environment in LTC Strictly speaking, brokers are "middlemen"—mediators between the providers and end users of a product. Thus, if seeking information on applied policy research, we would expect an information broker to be an independent bridging organization that links the two distinct worlds of research production and policy making (Feldman, Gold, and Chu 1994   , Feldman, Gold, and Chu 1997   ). Such bridging organizations do exist in the LTC field. However, a more striking observation that emerged from our environmental scan is the fact that a host of other organizations have developed or attempted to develop their own information brokering capacity. A number of membership organizations that represent state policy makers include brokering activities among their services to constituents, focusing on topics important to their membership. Furthermore, many individual researchers and research organizations both produce research and engage in a variety of dissemination activities, although generally limited to the information produced by in-house researchers. Finally, some foundations, advocacy organizations, and government agencies sponsor research from both in-house and outside researchers and disseminate the results of those studies. This diverse range of LTC brokering organizations reflects the fragmented state of LTC research. Table 2  shows examples of the many groups that to some extent act as LTC information brokers. To a greater or lesser extent each has attempted to develop some capacity to bridge the communications gap between the individuals who produce analytic data and the politicians and policy makers who are potential end users of such data. (See  Appendix , Note 4.)  Table 3  shows some of the parameters along which broker groups vary.Some groups, such as foundations and some government agencies, focus primarily on funding high-quality applied research. Through their funding requirements they also may influence the level of effort that grantees or contractors put into research dissemination, and they may provide resources earmarked for information brokering. Furthermore, in recent years, some of these organizations have developed their own relatively sophisticated information-brokering capacity. However, LTC is generally one among many subject areas within their purview.University-based and free-standing research centers focus primarily on conducting research (often in certain specialized areas). They also may work to translate and disseminate their research findings, but they typically devote proportionately few resources to these activities."Bridging organizations" truly act as middlemen. They tend to do little in the way of original research but focus primarily on identifying important policy issues and conveying policy-relevant information—some, but not all, research-based—to policy makers and politicians. Bridging organizations often work through standing or ad hoc committees of policy makers to identify key issues and needs. Some have their own in-house analytic or research staff to synthesize and translate existing research or conduct policy analyses, whereas others contract with outside researchers to do so. Some provide a good deal of news and technical assistance, and others focus on disseminating more formal analytic work. Although most have a health policy specialty, relatively few specialize in LTC issues per se."Constituent" or membership organizations, such as the National Governors Association or the National Conference of State Legislatures, tend to differ from bridging organizations in their closer proximity to and dependence on the states for organizational and financial support. Similar to bridging organizations, they work to identify important policy issues, provide useful information to their members, and they may employ their own analytic staff. However, constituent organizations usually must spread staff and resources across a host of issues and activities, both health and nonhealth related. For both types of groups, the function of research translation tends to wax and wane depending on the time constraints and skills of available staff, as well as on the success of efforts to secure outside funding for this purpose.Academic researchers and research institutions warrant further discussion, because so many features of the academic environment make it likely that the information produced by academic researchers—both in and outside of academia—is unsuitable for or less easily available to policy makers. First, researchers' intended audience is usually other researchers; their preferred medium is peer-reviewed journals or presentations at academic conferences. There are strong career incentives to preserve this status quo and very few incentives, beyond the intrinsic rewards of influencing a particular program or policy, for researchers to translate their findings into policy-relevant terms or disseminate their findings more widely; also, few resources are available to help them do this. One of the researchers who participated in our conference commented: "Why would we think researchers are the people to influence policy? Applied researcher is an oxymoron."The preceding quote notwithstanding, some individual researchers do reach out successfully to policy makers. Many more, however, lack the skills and tools needed to do this and would need significant support to make their work more readily accessible. However, there are few resources that would help them. For example, university communications departments are more likely to be geared to potential donors than to policy makers in a particular substantive policy area. Nonacademic research institutions tend to do a better job, especially to the extent that policy makers are seen as potential or ongoing customers or purchasers of applied research services. Even these institutions, however, often present their work in formats that conform to academic norms of focus and presentation. Systems Issues in Brokering As described above, the brokering environment in LTC is dense and diverse. These characteristics make generalization difficult: For each assertion, a valid qualification can be made. Nevertheless, several themes emerged from our interviews ( Table 4  ). The brokering environment in LTC is highly fragmented. Many groups that are recognized as reliable brokers of research information in health policy do not focus on LTC in any consistent or comprehensive way. This inconsistency means that policy makers need help in navigating the fragmented information sources that exist in LTC. It is difficult for them to identify a comprehensive source of research-based information on a given LTC policy topic or to gain a sense of the range of research conducted in a given area—or, indeed, of any research consensus that might have emerged. Given this fragmentation in the supply of LTC information, it is no surprise that policy makers with the greatest access to reliable, useful information are those who have had the opportunity to meet or hear about prominent experts in the field or who have enough slack resources to deploy junior staff to the time-consuming task of finding and sifting through undigested information from multiple sources. State policy makers in LTC are often not a key target for brokers. Because LTC is located in different agencies in different states and because brokers tend to cover a range of topics, state policy makers in LTC may not be seen as key members of a broker's target audience. However, there is some evidence that LTC is becoming a higher priority outside its "natural" constituency (i.e., the agencies responsible for administering LTC services)—specifically, among legislators' and executives' offices. Several respondents reported that more and more of these policy makers are asking for information on LTC, and some constituent organizations are responding. Both the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures, for example, have recruited staff with LTC experience and have developed some capacity to address aging- or disability-specific issues along with the other issues they routinely address. Other groups that specifically target LTC policy makers on an ongoing basis, such as the NASHP and the National Association of State Units on Aging, also must spread scarce resources across a range of activities of which research translation is not necessarily the highest priority. Mechanisms for dissemination often miss the mark. Common mechanisms for communication are often seen by policy makers to be missing the mark—a situation that should not be surprising, given that few of the brokers interviewed reported systematic evaluation of their brokering efforts. As noted previously, reports and other information produced by foundations, research institutions, and some government agencies were criticized for being too academic in nature. Information in general is often too dense and copious—policy makers find it difficult to pick out relevant and useful information. Websites were seen as difficult to locate and navigate, as well as often out of date. Finally, many conferences were criticized as being too focused on operational, rather than strategic issues. Why, then, do brokers persist in using these mechanisms? Brokers reported that they were often chosen on the basis of ease, cost, or at the behest of funders. Brokering activities devoted to LTC are often sporadic and funding is erratic. Groups that are able to devote resources to research translation and dissemination tend to be groups that cover a range of topics in health policy. Although some of these do attend to LTC issues consistently, more often attention is paid to LTC when, for some reason, the issue becomes "hot." Thus, attention to LTC issues depends not only on the range of non-LTC issues that must be covered or the interests and expertise of a broker's available staff but also on what the national media are covering at any given time. Moreover, few broker groups that specifically focus on LTC have resources that match those of larger groups, with the notable exception of AARP's Public Policy Institute. Furthermore, the predictability and availability of funding for LTC information makes dissemination problematic, because many brokers in LTC rely on soft money. Conclusions Our analysis has revealed a mismatch between the activities researchers and brokers engage in and the perceived needs of policy makers. Weiss 1977   , Weiss 1989    and others (Albaek 1995   ; Greenberg et al. 1995   ; Shulock 1999   ) have argued that such mismatches are attributable in large part to the tendency of social scientists to assume that policy makers follow a linear, "rational choice" decision-making process, whereby information is first collected and synthesized and decisions then made "on the merits." These scholars have observed, instead, that formal analysis feeds into a much larger, nonlinear political process of decision making, where the influence of evidence-based information is heavily dependent on its perceived relevance to political debate and public discourse. It follows that researchers and others who hope to maximize the use of research information must adapt themselves to this reality.The policy makers interviewed for this research would concur. As one conference participant noted, "research projects end, but politics endures." Policy makers made it clear that their use of research-based information is for the most part contingent on its translation into simple, understandable terms that make it germane to the problems they face and that enable them to persuade legislators and gubernatorial staff of its relevance to their political agendas.Two related needs expressed by policy makers were to navigate the information environment and to anticipate issues that are likely to arise in the future. These needs point to the importance of synthesis and translation—that is, activities and products that pull together evidence-based information (thus helping policy makers to navigate the information glut) and interpret its meaning for policy formulation and planning for the future. Synthesis and translation, however, are but two—albeit key—components of any strategy intended to improve the overall information-brokering environment in LTC. Complementary efforts to bridge the terminological, cultural, and professional divide between researchers and policy makers should also be an important component of any strategy designed to improve the use of evidence-based information for LTC. These and other strategic objectives are outlined in  Table 5  . Increasing and Sustaining Support for Key Research Synthesis, Translation, and Dissemination Activities One of the clearest lessons learned from this research is the importance of support for making research accessible to policy makers. The production of research that is ignored by policy makers is the cumulative result of researchers' and brokers' limited knowledge of good dissemination practice; a lack of motivation to translate research findings into policy-relevant terms and disseminate it (due to the incentives experienced by researchers, especially those in university settings); and a lack of resources to support these efforts. Conversely, organizations cited as being effective information brokers are those that see good dissemination as the product of sound data, sophisticated packaging, and knowledgeable marketing, and that are able to earmark money, dedicate staff time, and, frequently, commission outside experts for the related purposes of information synthesis, translation, and dissemination.Funders could address each of these factors. They could be more explicit about their expectations regarding translation and dissemination and be willing to provide the funding and/or technical assistance to facilitate it. Through consistent funding over time they could facilitate expertise-building by selected brokering entities; they could also facilitate "branding," a characteristic of successful brokering organizations that is discussed below. Dedicated, predictable support for synthesis, translation, and sophisticated dissemination of LTC research information would make it possible to improve vehicles for communication and help policy makers manage the information glut. Improving Vehicles for Communication Much more attention could be paid to mechanisms for communication when making LTC research findings available to policy makers. Good communicators recognize that writing for policy makers is a specialized skill that requires dedicated resources. A major contributor to AARP's success as a broker is the time and attention it expends in making its reports easy to read. The products from the National Academy on an Aging Society also reflect in-house expertise in report production. The General Accounting Office requires its staff to undergo writing courses to help ensure the production of clearly written products and employs editorial staff to help this process. Although in some instances it may make sense to teach researchers to do the synthesis, translation, and dissemination of research, in others it may be more expeditious and cost-effective to employ others to perform or provide support for these functions.Meetings and conferences are another mechanism cited as being important to policy makers. However, few of the policy makers interviewed were able to identify meetings that were consistently useful, indicating that more work needs to be done to make meetings suitable for them. They recommended that conferences be small, focused, and attended by carefully selected individuals. As one said, in good meetings, "I stretch my mind and grow" and "learn more in two days than I would on the web" through the "back and forth dialogue" with others. To be successful, such events must be carefully designed and implemented to address topics of mutual interest, to rely on written materials that reflect the principles of good research translation, and to incorporate techniques for surmounting barriers resulting from the different "languages" that researchers and policy makers use to describe their work.Another mechanism that could be strengthened is the relationship between local research centers and policy makers (Coburn 1998   ). Local research centers that have ongoing relationships with state agencies can work proactively to provide policy makers with advice that is informed by research findings and is sensitive to the culture, history, and ways of doing business particular to an individual state. Helping Policy Makers Manage the Information Glut Activities and products that synthesize and summarize a range of research findings are a helpful means of managing information overload, one of the most important realities for policy makers. Such activities and products should aim to survey the range of research findings on important questions, identify areas of convergence and disagreement, and spell out their policy implications. Policy makers can then act on the best evidence available, avoiding the need to assess individually research that is often conflicting, technical, and dense. Well-translated synthesis activities help policy makers see clear links between research findings and policy-making solutions. Syntheses also help researchers identify those areas and questions calling out for additional research."Branding" by information brokers is another practice that helps policy makers manage information overload. Organizations such as the AARP Public Policy Institute, that establish a clear identity, or "brand," by demonstrating a commitment to effective brokering over the long haul, help policy makers navigate the information glut because they are a recognizable and reliable source of information for certain identifiable subject areas. Given limited time and scarce staff resources, policy makers often turn first to a familiar source in the hope that their immediate question can be answered. It follows that successful branding is a virtue, if not a necessity, for brokers seeking to reach a large policy audience.Recognizing the value of clearly identified information brands, some policy makers (and brokers in some bridging organizations) wistfully long for a one-stop shop or clearinghouse to help them manage information overload. Although it seems unrealistic that any one group could become a source of information on all LTC research—let alone other types of LTC information—a group could realistically provide a current awareness service focusing on recent research findings and, perhaps, ongoing projects of interest as well as referrals to a network of policy researchers. Such an enterprise would likely require substantial resources and would need to navigate carefully among existing brokers' established activities and areas of expertise. Moreover, it would only be seen as useful if the information were carefully edited to meet policy makers' needs and produced quickly by a source that had credibility in the policy-making community (and presumably the research community, as well). Bridging the Gaps Between Researchers and Policy Makers A major theme that emerged from both our interviews and our conference was the detrimental effect of the linguistic, cultural, and professional divide between researchers and policy makers. While they acknowledge these barriers, members of both groups see great potential for improved communication leading to greater use of research-based information. Bringing researchers and policy makers together helps make researchers' work more policy-relevant (Coburn 1998   ). "Such meetings make it possible to see what assumptions are operating regarding certain issues, to identify which options need to be explored, and determine what kinds of data are seen as most meaningful" (Roos and Shapiro 1999   , p. JS300). Furthermore, involvement of policy makers early on maximizes the likelihood that they will use the research in their work—"bringing decision makers who can use the results of a particular piece of research into its formulation and conduct is the best predictor for seeing the findings applied" (Lomas 2000   , p. 237; see also Schalm and Semradek 1994   ; Weiss 1977   ). An additional benefit of involving policy makers in the research process is that policy makers and researchers may thus develop relationships that extend far beyond any one research project.One valuable bridging activity can be the involvement of outside researchers in developing and strengthening existing state infrastructure to turn already available data into useful information for policy. For example, in Michigan researchers were brought in to help design a new LTC targeting system (Fries, B., personal communication, University of Michigan, 1996); in Rhode Island a research group has been working to help the state develop an internal program monitoring and evaluation system (Allen, S., personal communication, Brown University, 2000). Such arrangements have the benefit of building state capacity while at the same time exposing LTC researchers to the real world problems to which their research skills and insights are applicable.Because policy makers in LTC rely heavily on interpersonal contacts for information, those who build formal or informal relationships with both local and national researchers have easier access to information than those who do not. Where such relationships exist, finding information may be as simple as placing a call to a friend or colleague, or it may involve a more formal process of commissioning a study to be conducted through a competitive process. Linkages formed around particular state-specific research projects that are, in effect, commissioned by policy makers are generally perceived as the most policy-relevant; however, such research can be costly to fund, and not all states have budgeted funds for such activities.As discussed earlier, conferences, workshops, and other meetings that are carefully tailored to facilitate communication across the professional divide can be an effective and relatively efficient way to build researcher–policy maker linkages. In addition, interview respondents and conference participants suggested several other mechanisms designed to build trust and facilitate collaborative agenda development. One conference recommendation was to develop targeted researcher–policy maker training programs to develop "common pathways" for skills and language. Another was to fund research–policy fellowships that would allow two-way movement, that is, for researchers to spend time in government and policy makers to spend time in an applied research setting. Distance education and "virtual" fellowships were two additional suggestions. Improving the Production of LTC Policy-Relevant Research Many important policy questions remain unanswered in LTC. The most common frustration expressed by the policy makers we interviewed was the lack of routinely collected, uniform, and robust state-level data to allow systematic, valid comparisons of how well the LTC system is working in states with different LTC policies. Researchers, in turn, observed the lack of ample, predictable LTC research funding—from government or foundations—for comparative or other policy-related purposes. Both groups agreed that in order to stimulate such funding it would be important to make a compelling case for the importance of LTC research findings both past and future. A number of examples of path-breaking, influential research were cited, including development of the ADL/IADL measurement system (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffe 1961   ), the development of the nursing home Minimum Data Set (Morris, Hawes, Fries, Phillips, and Mor 1990   ), and the home health Outcomes Assessment and Information Set (OASIS) (Shaughnessy, Crisler, Schlenker, Arnold, and Kramer 1994   ). This research may consist of developing new techniques and tools, evaluating pioneering programs, and/or developing frameworks and identifying policy patterns and developments over time. Some of these efforts could be facilitated by helping states to improve their own ability to conduct research. Virtually all such efforts have the beneficial side-effect of forming useful researcher–policy maker contacts—as do overtures made by individual researchers who seek state data or other state-specific information for national research studies. Strengthening System Capacity to Anticipate and Identify Emerging Policy Problems and Issues In the end, policy makers seek to reduce uncertainty. They want to understand the many factors—some under their control and others not—that affect their ability to shape and deliver LTC services. These include demographic changes, legislation, regulation, and court decisions. They also include evidence of the efficacy of service delivery systems, models and targeted interventions, as well as methods and tools to manage services. To the extent that researchers wish to influence policy and facilitate good outcomes, they need to be aware of these factors in order to respond to policy makers' needs. A variety of mechanisms can be and, at any given time, are being marshaled to identify likely or emerging problems and issues. They range from the use of quantitative models and national surveys to the use of key informant interviews, site visits, and other qualitative methods to the use of expert panels, "summit" meetings, visioning, and other group techniques. To be truly useful, we believe, the findings of these various information-producing activities should be synthesized and translated for policy makers' use. In addition, they should be used to guide, at least partially, the development of future policy–research agendas and scanning efforts.Our research findings deliver a useful reminder to those who think that producing good research is sufficient to improve the shape of LTC. The policy makers who contributed to our environmental scan told us, loud and clear, that academic-quality research is not reaching them. Therefore, more effort must be devoted to the task of synthesizing, translating, and disseminating research information to policy makers. Funders can contribute to this effort by considering ways to alter systematically the incentives and support provided to researchers and by committing dollars and/or technical assistance explicitly to brokering organizations and activities. Brokers can try to listen to policy makers' needs more carefully and focus on more effective mechanisms for communicating with them. And lastly, researchers can make efforts to include policy makers more directly in the process of formulating research questions and objectives, so that their research agendas more closely track the policy concerns of those who are responsible for the future of LTC. Notes We use the term "policy maker" here to include both elected officials (e.g., governors and legislators, who are responsible for proposing and enacting budgets and legislation) and appointed executives who are responsible for policy implemen-tation. Although legislatures technically "make" policy through the authorization and appropriations processes, appointed executives and civil servants often bear significant policy-making responsibility through the design of legislative proposals, the interpretation of statutes, and the promulgation of guidelines and regulations.The sources cited here, as well as others, note the importance of virtually all of the issues discussed in the Issues section. Rather than cite them repeatedly throughout the text, we have cited them once at the outset of this section."Partnership for Long-Term Care" was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded demonstration program that permitted a select group of states to count private LTC insurance benefits toward Medicaid spend-down requirements for nursing home care.Feldman, Gold, and Chu 1994   , Feldman, Gold, and Chu 1997    discussed the importance of developing such bridging functions within state government to promote the use of internally produced data for state health policy making.The Forum  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The Positively Aging® program is an innovative set of interdisciplinary teaching materials that uses examples from geriatrics and gerontology to teach sixth through eighth grade curricular elements. The purpose of this study was to determine if use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials by regular classroom teachers could change middle school students' images of elders. Design and Methods: At the beginning of the 1998–1999 school year, students at two San Antonio, Texas, middle schools were asked to draw a typical older person. These drawings were coded as positive, neutral, or negative portrayals of elders. One school then used the Positively Aging® materials as part of the curriculum; the other school served as the control. Second drawings were obtained from the students at the end of the school year and compared to those from baseline. Results: Both drawings were completed by 60% of students at the intervention school and 55% of students at the control school. Of the 782 paired drawings from the intervention school, 34% were more positive at Time 2 compared to 25% of 591 paired drawings from the control school (χ2 = 13.9, p < .001). In addition, only 20% of the second drawings from the intervention school were more negative than the first drawing compared to 27% from the control school (χ2 = 11.3, p < .001). Using a generalized logit model, we adjusted for each student's baseline drawing (positive–neutral–negative), grade level, gender, ethnic group, and socioeconomic status. After adjustment, students in the intervention school were more likely to draw positive (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 1.94) or positive and neutral images (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.21, 2.19) at follow-up compared to the control school. Implications: This controlled study demonstrated that use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials and activities moved middle school students toward a more positive view of elders. Interdisciplinary teaching materials based on geriatrics and gerontology can be successfully developed and tested in public school systems to affect attitudes about aging.   Education ,  Middle school ,  Controlled trial ,  Aging Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe White House Conference on Aging (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare 1961   ) endorsed the need for aging education in public schools 40 years ago; since then there has been a steady increase in the number of efforts to infuse gerontologic content into public school curricula (Lucchino, Ferguson, and Lane 1997   ; McGuire 1987   ). Aging is a universal process experienced by everyone: students, parents, teachers, and school systems. Recognizing the impact of lengthening life spans on personal and societal growth and development, a number of teacher organizations (e.g., National Association of Biology Teachers) are adopting content about aging and changes over time into their professional standards.Two organizations have long been involved in developing and cataloging materials on aging education: the National Academy for Teaching and Learning About Aging (formerly the Center for Understanding Aging) at the University of North Texas, Denton ( www.unt.edu/natla ), and Generations Together at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ( www.pitt.edu/~gti ). Although aging education materials for public education exist, there continues to be a need to test and evaluate programs designed to change children's attitudes and beliefs on aging. Description of the Positively Aging® Teaching Materials The Positively Aging® teaching materials are the product of an innovative interdisciplinary instructional program that grew from an active partnership between the working scientists of the Aging Research and Education Center of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and middle school educators from Northside Independent School District in San Antonio. Initiated in 1993, the partnership uses examples from geriatrics and gerontology to enhance education in the areas of precollege mathematics and the life and behavioral sciences (e.g., health promotion and disease prevention). The product of this project is a set of classroom-ready instructional materials created by middle school teachers with input from gerontologists. In developing the Positively Aging® lessons and activities, there were three long-term goals. First, to provide innovative, effective teaching materials centered on mathematics and science curricular elements and based on examples from geriatrics and gerontology. Second, to help students learn to make critical, life-determining decisions for extending and enhancing their own lives. Third, to help students develop a sensitivity to the needs and concerns of the aging population. This study focuses on the third goal, by determining whether children's images of elders can be transformed to a more positive view.In its present form, the Positively Aging® teaching materials consist of 12 integrated interdisciplinary units with 276 activities. The units (with their interdisciplinary lessons and activities) are packaged separately to facilitate dissemination. Each unit has an overarching theme with a set of learning objectives mapped to specific knowledge and skills as defined by the Texas Education Agency 1997   . Lessons within units are designed to meet specific learning objectives. Activities in each lesson are classroom exercises designed to stimulate students to actively learn the content and skills necessary to master the material. The Positively Aging® materials specifically incorporate health promotion and disease prevention objectives from Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2000   ). The lessons and activities directly address the two central Healthy People 2010 goals of (a) increasing the quality and years of healthy life, and (b) eliminating health disparities. The rationale, structure, and content of the 12 Positively Aging® units have been previously described in detail (Lichtenstein et al. 1999   ). Challenges to Infusing Aging Education in Public Schools Russell 1979    identified five barriers to incorporating aging education into public schools. The Positively Aging® teaching materials address and overcome a number of these obstacles (Lichtenstein et al. 1999   ). The first barrier is that aging represents a nontraditional topic (i.e., it is not typically part of the school curriculum). Our approach has been to use examples from geriatrics and gerontology to teach established curricular elements. For example, if a student needs to learn the physical concept of density in a science class, the Positively Aging® materials use bone mineral density to teach this. Bone mineral density can then be linked to bone biology and osteoporosis, providing opportunities to teach about nutritional and exercise habits to maintain bone health across the life span. Russell's second barrier was that material and resources are inadequate to effectively teach the subject. Since Russell's 1979 article, multiple bibliographies and lesson plans have been created, one of which now is the Positively Aging® curriculum.The third and fourth barriers to aging education were that many teachers are not interested in aging and lack the training to teach the topic. Through structured training programs that provide opportunities for professional development, a growing number of teachers now receive training in the delivery of aging education content. Once shown that the lessons from the Positively Aging® materials facilitate teaching established curricular elements rather than change what they are required to instruct, teachers are more likely to accept the lessons and activities. Once involved with the lessons, teachers often confront their own biases about aging.Russell's fifth barrier was that attempts at content integration have been unsuccessful. The Positively Aging® teaching materials are designed to be interdisciplinary so that a team of middle school teachers may coordinate teaching different aspects of a unit simultaneously. Further, the Positively Aging® lessons and activities have been linked to state and national educational standards (American Association for the Advancement of Science 1993   ; National Research Council 1996   ; Texas Education Agency 1997   ).McGuire 1986   , McGuire 1994    noted that when aging education is presented, it frequently focuses on the pathology of aging, rather than on positive aspects. She states that gerontologic content should promote aging as a natural, lifelong process of growth and development. The Positively Aging® materials provide ample opportunity for intergenerational activities, the assessment of elders in society, and changes over the life span. Children can be taught that older people are valuable and contributing members of society. Old and young people can enjoy and learn from each other, comparing their similarities and differences. McGuire 1994    also states that the goal of aging education involves producing a generation of older people who successfully adapt to old age. Jantz, Seefeldt, Galper, and Serock 1976    call for curricula that enable children to assess their perceptions of the aging process and see how it affects them. These curricula should expose children to an unbiased look at the characteristics of elderly people in a variety of roles to discourage formation of stereotypical attitudes. Indeed, intergenerational activities in schools have shown that exposure to vigorous elders can improve children's views of aging (Newman, Faux, and Larimer 1997   ). Assessing Children's Attitudes Toward Elders Children's attitudes toward aging and elderly adults have been assessed using survey instruments and drawings. Examples of surveys include the Children's Views on Aging (CVoA) questionnaire (Marks, Newman, and Onawola 1985   ; Newman et al. 1997   ) and the Children's Attitude Toward the Elderly (CATE) questionnaire (Jantz et al. 1976   , Jantz et al. 1977   ). Newman and colleagues 1997    note the importance of having children express their opinions of elders without an external framework imposed by adults. They note that when asked in an open-ended way, about one third of elementary school children will have positive views of elders, and one half will describe neutral physical characteristics of aging (e.g., wrinkles).Human figure drawing has been used in multiple settings to investigate children's intellectual development and attitudes (Harris 1963   ; Harris and Pinder 1974   ). Drawings also have been employed in at least three studies to explore children's attitudes about elders (Couper, Donorfio, and Goyer 1995   ; Falchikov 1990   ; Seefeldt et al. 1977   ). Seefeldt and colleagues 1977    had 180 preschool to sixth grade children evaluate four drawings of one man at ages 20, 40, 60, and 80 years through a structured interview. The majority (69%) of the children were able to correctly sequence the drawings, thereby demonstrating an understanding of relative age. The interviews with the children indicated negative attitudes toward the physical characteristics of the image of the eldest man and the children's view of their own aging.In contrast to the Seefeldt study (1977), Falchikov 1990    asked 28 Scottish children (mean age 11 years) to draw images of an old man, an old woman, a young man, and a young woman. In comparing the drawings, images of elders frequently showed signs of physical deterioration (e.g., the use of a cane, inactivity). The older figures were drawn smaller than the younger figures, and Falchikov felt that the images frequently portrayed stereotypes of aging. This small study illustrates the rich detail of these drawings and contrasts the extremes of youth and old age—it provides a starting framework for other investigators working to describe the content of children's drawings of elders.Couper and colleagues 1995    had 423 children (ages 6–11 years) draw pictures of an old person and a young person, and then asked them to explain the differences. Children who drew images of someone they knew (e.g., a grandparent) were more likely to portray an older person with positive attributes. Girls tended to draw more positive images of elders than boys, and boys also expressed more negative ideas about aging. On average, older children were more negative about old age than younger children.We were not able to find a study that directly compares the use of an open-ended qualitative method (such as drawings) with a quantitative close-ended method (e.g., standardized questionnaire). Qualitative open-ended approaches solicit children's views while minimizing the potential for an expectation bias, that is, students responding in a way they think they are being asked to respond—"what the teacher wants." Open-ended methods are more challenging to interpret, given the range and heterogeneity of responses. Standardized questionnaires have the advantage of a uniform metric for assessing attitudes, but may either frame the expected response or miss important content because it is not included as an item on the questionnaire. Questionnaires may also contain open-ended responses (Newman et al. 1997   ), but these, too, may be challenging to interpret. Without complementary use and analysis of both methods for assessing children's attitudes about aging within a single study, it is difficult to directly compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials by regular classroom teachers could change children's images of elders as reflected through their drawings of older people. We chose drawings as our measure of children's views of elders because this is an activity that does not completely depend on a student's reading and writing ability. Further, having teachers collect drawings as a classroom activity precludes the need for survey administration by research personnel. Methods Outcome Measure—Students' Drawings of Elders The Positively Aging® teaching materials Unit 2 (A Look at Them) is designed to explore and diminish stereotypes associated with aging through an activity titled, "Help the NIA." Students are first presented with background material about the mission of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Next, they are told that the NIA has a problem; it does not know what a typical older person looks like. The students are then asked to help the NIA by drawing a picture of a "typical" older person.Drawings are made in a 14.0 × 17.5 cm rectangle. Teachers instruct their students to draw the whole person and to make the very best picture possible. Students place the person in a setting and answer a series of questions describing the picture. The questions include the person's age, activities, feelings, thoughts, possible relation to the student, and how the drawn person's characteristics differ from those of the student.Our goal was to collect drawings from every student in the two schools at the beginning (September–October 1998) and at the end (April–May 1999) of the school year. Students were not given grades for completion or the quality of the drawings. Characterization of Positive–Neutral–Negative Drawings Using a structured coding sheet and standardized instructions, four raters (CLB, LAP, MJL, and CEM) coded the characteristics of the drawings in detail. A large number of features (e.g., use of assisted devices and hunched posture—see  Fig. 1 ) were abstracted from the drawings. In assessing changes over time, we could not realistically examine differences in every drawn feature and chose a global measure instead. As part of this process, the raters classified the drawings and written responses to the questions into three overarching categories: negative, neutral, or positive images of older people. This article focuses solely on the overall rating of the images, not the specific characteristics drawn by the students.Raters worked independently to code the drawings. Negative responses were defined as those associated with dependence and isolation (e.g., placement in a nursing home— Fig. 1 ). Neutral responses were defined as purely descriptive with no values attached to them (e.g., simply sitting with few described activities— Fig. 2 ). Positive responses were defined as those associated with independence and social interaction (e.g., exercising, visiting with friends— Fig. 3 ). Reproducibility of the Drawings We pilot-tested and validated our methods for coding the drawings in a third middle school that was not part of the study. Fifty students completed the "Help the NIA" activity and then made second drawings 2 weeks later without participating in any Positively Aging® activities in the interim. One rater (CEM) coded the 50 paired drawings as positive, neutral, or negative. Using Kappa statistics and polychoric correlation for this ordinal outcome measure, we compared the drawings from Time 1 and Time 2 (Cohen 1968   ; Drasgow 1986   ; Fleiss 1975   ). The Kappa value was .07 (95% confidence interval [CI] = −.14, .30) and the polychoric correlation was −.01. This low level of agreement indicates that students are not likely to draw a similar image on two separate occasions close together. The test for symmetry statistic (Fleiss 1975   ) was .93 (3 df, p = .82), indicating that there was no systematic drift toward more negative or more positive images between drawings. Interrater Agreement To determine the comparability of coding between the raters, all four independently coded a random sample of 50 drawings as positive, neutral, or negative. The pair-wise interrater Kappa statistics were excellent (Landis and Koch 1977   ), ranging from .64 to .81. The weighted Kappa for all four raters was also excellent at .73 (95% CI = .67, .80). Assessment of Rater Bias (Intrarater Agreement) Raters were not masked to the school of origin when coding the drawings. To test for potential rater coding bias (i.e., knowing which drawings were from the intervention school, did the raters tend to code them more positively?) we selected a random sample of 60 follow-up drawings for each rater for recoding (10 positive, 10 neutral, and 10 negative from each of the two schools). One rater (LAP) only had 44 drawings because she happened to code a smaller number of drawings for one school at follow-up. Thus, the total sample for this test was 224 rather than 240 drawings. These 224 drawings had all school identifiers removed and were recoded a second time by the raters.The results of the test for potential rater bias are presented in  Table 1  . Individual Kappa statistics for the four raters range from .62 to .87. The overall weighted Kappa was .74 (95% CI = .68, .81). The Kappa statistics for the intervention and control school were similar at .78 and .71, respectively. In addition, none of the tests of symmetry were statistically significant, indicating no difference in pattern of coding responses between coding sessions. This means there was no shift toward either a more positive or more negative coding pattern between occasions.These data demonstrate no evidence for coding bias in assessing the drawings between the two schools. Further, the data show excellent intrarater agreement in coding the same images on two separate occasions (Landis and Koch 1977   ). Study Design and Program Implementation Selection and Description of the Schools Northside Independent School District (NISD) is the sixth largest school district (out of 1,110) in Texas. NISD serves more than 61,000 students in 350 square miles of Northwest San Antonio and surrounding Bexar County. All 12 NISD middle schools were potentially eligible for inclusion in the study. During the pilot phase of the research, the middle school principals were surveyed about the schools and their willingness to participate in the project. Two schools agreed to participate, with one school specifically asking to be the control site during the implementation year due to their competing academic programs and school district requirements.The characteristics of the two schools are compared in  Table 2  . The control school had proportionately more Mexican American and economically disadvantaged students than the intervention school. In addition, the mobility rates (the proportion of students who enter or leave the school after the school year has started) were greater in the control school. Participants This study was approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Institutional Review Board. The study came under the "exempt" category of the regulations for research involving humans because it was conducted in established educational settings and was testing the effectiveness of teaching materials. All students at both middle schools took home a flyer describing the study at the beginning of the school year. Ten families (5 at the intervention school, 5 at the control school) decided not to participate. The drawings of these 10 children were not included in the data collection and analyses. Teacher Training During June 1998, 13 teachers from the intervention school (approximately 10% of the faculty) participated in an intense 2-week in-service training program (60 contact hours) in the rationale and use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials. We attempted to get representation from as many of the 12 academic interdisciplinary teams at the intervention school as possible. The training program, entitled Stealth Gerontology™, provided direct experience with sample lessons and activities from all Positively Aging® units. Faculty from the University of Texas Health Science Center led interactive seminars in their respective content areas. None of the teachers from the control school participated in any training. Suggested Scope and Sequence Through teacher feedback from pilot-testing the Positively Aging® teaching materials in the classroom, a logical scope and sequence has emerged for presenting the lessons across the middle school grade levels. The suggested sequence is guided by the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills requirements (Texas Education Agency 1997   ), identifying knowledge and skill elements that are grade specific, and elements that can be repeated in sixth through eighth grade. The suggested scope and sequence are summarized in  Table 3  . Statistical Methods Data were first evaluated by developing contingency tables for the positive–neutral–negative assessments of the drawings. For measures of inter- and intrarater agreement, we used Kappa statistics to test for agreement beyond what would be observed by chance (Cohen 1968   ; Fleiss 1975   ; Landis and Koch 1977   ). For test–retest repeatability we used polychoric correlation for strength of association in an ordinal variable (Drasgow 1986   ) in addition to the Kappa statistic. Tests of symmetry were used to assess for shifts of distributions within contingency tables in either direction (Fleiss 1975   ).Chi-square statistics (Armitage 1971   ) and marginal homogeneity (Stokes, Davis, and Koch 1995   ) were used to test the differences in positive–neutral–negative distributions of drawings within and between schools from baseline to follow-up. Finally, we used generalized logit modeling (Clogg, Eliason, and Grego 1990   ) to adjust for the variables associated with the follow-up drawings and the difference in distribution of demographic factors between the two middle schools. We used generalized logit modeling because polytomous regressions indicated that the data did not fit the assumption of equivalent effects at the different levels of the ordinal outcome variable (positive–neutral–negative). For the generalized logit models, some independent variables had to be recoded to bivariate variables. For example, grade level was recoded into two variables, with seventh grade as the reference (sixth vs seventh grade and seventh vs eighth grade). The results from the generalized logit model are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs. Results Use of the Teaching Materials We tracked the utilization of the Positively Aging® teaching materials in both the intervention and control schools during the course of the 1998–1999 school year. We assessed utilization by attending team meetings at both schools and directly asking teachers which lessons and activities they were using in their classroom. At the intervention school all classes used at least one activity during the school year. However, within each grade there were specific classes where the trained teachers used much more of the curriculum. For example, one sixth-grade class used 45 activities from Units 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. A seventh-grade class was taught 63 activities from Units 1, 2, 3, and 6. In one eighth-grade class, 64 activities from Units 2, 4, 5, and 12 were taught. Across the intervention school, 192 of the 276 activities (70%) from the Positively Aging® teaching materials were taught at least once. In this first implementation, approximately one fourth of the intervention school students had exposure to multiple activities and lessons. At the control school, none of the materials were used in the classroom during the 1998–1999 school year. Response Rates and Assessment for Response Bias The response rates for obtaining baseline and follow-up drawings are listed in  Table 4  . At the beginning of the school year, baseline drawings were obtained from 79% and 83% of the intervention and control schools, respectively. At follow-up, the end of the school year, drawings were obtained from 69% and 61% of the students in the two schools. The drop-off in obtaining drawings was similar in both schools and attributable to competing educational programs and mandates (e.g., standardized testing). Further, as the school year progressed, schedules necessarily adjusted for unanticipated events that changed the timing of curricular instruction. A number of teachers reported that they simply did not have class time at the end of the school year to get second sets of drawings.We obtained paired drawings from 60% of the students at the intervention school and 55% at the control school. These proportions are similar. The reduced response rate for paired drawings is also due, in part, to the turnover in students during the school year. A student may have made a drawing in September, moved to another school in December, and not be available to create a drawing in April. The mobility rates for students moving in and out of these two schools were approximately 15–25% over the course of the school year ( Table 3  ).Within schools, there were no differences between respondents (those students for which we have paired drawings) and nonrespondents with respect to gender, ethnic group, or being economically disadvantaged. For the students for whom we had paired data, the proportions of girls were 52.7% and 48.1% in the intervention and control schools, respectively. The proportion of Mexican Americans was 27.9% and 62.9%, respectively, and the proportion of economically disadvantaged students was 10.0% and 44.5%, respectively. These proportions are similar to those present in both school populations at the beginning of the school year ( Table 2  ). Baseline Versus Follow-up Drawings The raw data for the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative drawings at baseline and follow-up, stratified by school, are listed in two panels in  Table 5  . At baseline, the distribution is similar for both schools: 28.1% positive, 49.0% neutral, and 23.0% negative at the intervention school compared with 32.0% positive, 47.7% neutral, and 20.3% negative at the control school (χ2 [2 df] = 3.03, p = .22). At follow-up, there was a shift—the proportion of positive drawings increased to 38.0% at the intervention school and decreased to 30.6% at the control school. The proportion of negative drawings decreased to 14.2% at the intervention school and increased to 22.2% at the control school. The difference in distributions between the schools at follow-up is statistically significant (χ2 [2 df] = 17.64, p < .001). For the control school, testing for marginal homogeneity at baseline and follow-up, there was no difference in the distributions (p = .66). In contrast, comparing the marginal homogeneity for the intervention school, a difference between baseline and follow-up was evident (p = .001).The proportion of students who drew more positive images (e.g., a shift from negative to neutral) was obtained by summing the three boldface numbers in both schools as shown in  Table 5  . More positive images were drawn at follow-up by 34.4% ([136 + 48 + 85]/782) of students at the intervention school and 25.0% ([66 + 25 + 57]/591) in the control school. This difference in proportions is statistically significant (χ2 [1 df] = 13.9, p < .001). The results are similar if restricted to only those persons who were negative or neutral at baseline: 47.8% of the intervention school and 36.8% of the control school were more positive at follow-up.The proportion of students who drew more negative images is obtained by summing the three numbers in italics in both schools as shown in  Table 5  . Students in the control school drew more negative images at follow-up (27.4% ([69 + 30 + 63]/591)) compared to the intervention school (19.7% ([90 + 16 + 48]/782)). This difference in proportions is also statistically significant (χ2 [1 df] = 11.3, p < .001). The results are similar if restricted to only those persons who were positive or neutral at baseline: 25.6% of the intervention school and 34.4% of the control school were more negative at follow-up.A post-hoc subgroup analysis was done within the intervention school to determine if classes that used more of the Positively Aging® lessons had greater shifts in the drawings compared to classes that used fewer lessons. There were no demonstrable differences between the two groups of classes in the positive–neutral–negative distribution of drawings at follow-up. Generalized Logit Modeling Generalized logit modeling was used to adjust the observed shifts in the follow-up drawings for (a) baseline drawing status, (b) grade level, (c) gender, (d) ethnic group, (e) being socioeconomically disadvantaged, and (f) school. The results are summarized in  Table 6  . The first column dichotomizes between negative drawings at follow-up and combined positive and neutral drawings. The second column dichotomizes between positive drawings at follow-up and combined neutral and negative drawings. At both dividing points for the positive–neutral–negative levels, ethnic group and being socioeconomically disadvantaged (i.e., eligible for free and reduced lunches) was not associated with the follow-up drawings. At both dividing points, girls were approximately two to three times more likely to draw positive images of elders than were boys (OR 1.63 and 2.76). The baseline drawing level was associated with level at follow-up: Children drawing positive images at baseline were twice as likely to draw positive images at follow-up (OR 1.87 and 2.00).At the first dividing point, there were no differences between sixth and seventh graders. Seventh graders were less likely than eighth graders to draw positive and neutral images at follow-up (OR 0.70). At the second dividing point, sixth and eighth graders were significantly more likely than seventh graders to draw positive images at follow-up (OR 1.38 and 1.94, respectively).After adjusting for grade level, gender, ethnic group, eligibility for free and reduced lunch, and baseline level of the drawing, students in the intervention school were significantly more likely to draw positive images of elders at follow-up compared to the control school. This observation was true for both levels of the drawing variable in the generalized logit analysis (OR 1.58 and 1.48 for the two levels of the ordinal outcome variable). Discussion This study demonstrates that use of the Positively Aging® teaching materials is associated with an improvement in children's drawn images of elders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controlled test of curricular materials focused on gerontology that demonstrates an impact on the images that middle school students have of older individuals. The present study also differs from others by trying to influence an entire school, not just a single class or grade.Our findings confirm the observation that girls are more likely than boys to draw positive images of elders (Couper et al. 1995   ). We found no difference in drawings based on ethnic group or being socioeconomically disadvantaged (as defined by being eligible for federally subsidized school luncheons). The distribution of positive–neutral–negative images observed in both schools at baseline is similar to the distribution of others in their survey work with elementary school children (Newman et al. 1997   ). Approximately 25% of students produce positive images on their own. About one half the images are neutral, being primarily physical descriptors without any values, either positive or negative, attached to them.Comparing the present study and prior reports in the literature, differences in study design must be considered. For example, Newman and colleagues 1997    reported improving fourth- and fifth-grade children's conceptions of elders simply by having older adults participate in classroom activities, whereas our sample is from middle schools (sixth–eighth grade). Work by Couper and associates 1995    indicated that younger children (ages 6–8) have less negative age-associated stereotypes than older children (ages 9–11). Thus age differences in samples could partially account for differences between studies. Newman and colleagues' study used a questionnaire, the CVoA, whereas our study used drawings as the assessment tool. We are unaware of any literature directly comparing the results from questionnaires with results from drawings. Thus, the outcome measures chosen partially explain observed differences between the studies. Finally, the Newman study is based on 71 predominantly African American students from Pennsylvania; there were post-test improvements on the CVoA without a control group, and it is difficult to measure how much of the change was attributable to the intergenerational program per se. In contrast, our study is based on 1,373 predominantly Mexican and European American children in two San Antonio schools with one school serving as a control site. We were able to demonstrate a statistically significant shift in the drawn images in the intervention school with no significant shift in the control school. Although a 10% change may not be "educationally" large, it is what we were able to measure with a one-year intervention. Educators and gerontologists working in school systems must take into account differences in research and evaluation methods prior to adopting a particular program or set of teaching materials. Limitations of the Study The results of the study must be interpreted within its limitations. First, we experienced a lower response rate in the number of drawings obtained at follow-up at the end of the school year. This drop-off in responses was due in part to children moving out of the school area. However, the primary reason is that teachers felt they could not take classroom time to collect drawings at the end of the school year. Mandated state testing and other curricular requirements simply took precedent. Nevertheless, the response rates were similar in both schools, and there was no evidence for systematic bias in the decreased response rates. Further, we believe that obtaining paired drawings from more than half the students in two middle schools actually represents a high response rate in this form of educational research.A second limitation is the variable and relatively low utilization of the Positively Aging® teaching materials in the intervention school. Here again, competing curricular requirements and inertia in adopting new lesson plans on the part of the school faculty played a role in the number of lessons and activities taught. We were able to formally train only about 10% of the intervention school faculty prior to the start of the school year. These are the realities of incorporating a voluntary program into any school and can only be overcome with increased training, support throughout the school year, and a persistent presence over the course of multiple years. Nevertheless, despite the low level of utilization over a one-year period, we were still able to measure a 10% shift to more positive images of elders (although classes in the intervention school that used larger numbers of lessons and activities did not show a greater shift toward more positive images). There may be key lessons (e.g., intergenerational activities) that are more conducive to changing children's views, whereas other lessons may change specific knowledge content. Presumably, utilization of the Positively Aging® materials over longer periods of time could result in greater shifts in children's perceptions of older persons.A third limitation is the marked differences in ethnic group and socioeconomic status between our schools; they are very different communities of learners, even though they come from one school district. Other investigators are likely to encounter similar differences when working with entire schools and obtaining controlled data. In 1998–1999, these were the only two middle schools in the NISD that were willing to take part in the study. We acknowledge that other unmeasured factors in the school environments may partially account for the observed changes in the drawings. In spite of the differences in student populations, there were no baseline differences in the distribution of the positive–neutral–negative drawing measure. Further, the differences in ethnic group and socioeconomic status between the schools were not associated in any way with changes in drawing status in the generalized logit models ( Table 6  ).A fourth potential limitation is the poor repeatability of the drawing measure. In the pilot middle school, children simply did not draw the same type of image of an older person on two occasions. This suggests that the positive–neutral–negative attribute for elders is not fixed in the minds of middle school students and may be changed with appropriate instruction. The fact that the intervention school showed more of a shift toward positive images than the control school over the course of the school year adds credence to this argument.A fifth limitation is turnover of students during the school year. We were surprised by the high mobility rates of students moving in and out of the school during the year. This turnover can only dilute the impact of any teaching program and is a reality for any public school system.Teacher turnover is less of a problem during the school year, but presents a sixth limitation to incorporating new teaching materials into a school. Teachers may move between schools from year to year. An instructional program may be dependent on a single outstanding teacher at a particular school. When that teacher moves to another school, other interests at the first school may replace the program.In spite of these limitations and barriers, the present controlled study demonstrates that the presence of an interdisciplinary teaching program that uses examples from geriatrics and gerontology to teach required curricular elements can improve middle school students' images of elders. Recommendations The challenges we encountered in testing the Positively Aging® teaching materials in the present study are likely to be there for any group interested in improving aging education in America's public school systems. There are at least five components to solutions that will facilitate the incorporation of gerontology content into schools. First, aging education programs must have a persistent year-to-year presence in the schools so that teaching about aging becomes part of the curriculum's structure. Second, opportunities exist for improving teacher training and professional development in gerontology. For example, all the Positively Aging® materials were written by middle school teachers and field tested in their classrooms; the act of creating and testing lessons and activities gave these teachers a sense of ownership and empowered them to use them with their students. Once materials are created and new knowledge becomes available, teachers may continually modify and adapt lessons for their specific classroom needs. These modifications can be incorporated into future revisions of a curriculum and increase its usefulness to others. A third strategy is to be sure that whatever aging education teaching materials are developed, they are linked to national, state, and local curriculum requirements. The Positively Aging® teaching materials are all carefully linked to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (Texas Education Agency 1997   ). We have also created these materials with linkages to national standards for science education and literacy (American Association for the Advancement of Science 1993   ; National Research Council 1996   ). Teachers may be more likely to pick up and use the teaching materials if they meet national and state standards for education. Fourth, creating a presence on the World Wide Web with teaching materials and instruction can overcome many of the barriers of access and support. Finally, advocacy at the state level to place aging education into curricula can create incentives in local school districts to adopt and implement these instructional programs.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This research reviewed studies that compare two or more racial, ethnic, national, or cultural groups on aspects of the dementia caregiving experience. Design and Methods: Electronic databases were searched to find studies published between 1996 and 2000 in peer-reviewed journals that met the above criteria. Results: Twenty-one studies based on 18 samples were identified. These articles included comparisons involving the following groups of caregivers: African Americans, Chinese, Chinese Americans, Koreans, Korean Americans, Latinos, Whites, and residents of 14 European Union countries. Consistent with previous research, White caregivers were more likely to be spouses when compared to other groups. White caregivers tended to report greater depression and appraised caregiving as more stressful than African American caregivers. Findings were mixed regarding differences in coping and social support, but suggested that minority groups may not have more available support than Whites. Common methodological limitations were a lack of noncaregiving control groups and failure to test specific pathways by which the grouping variable (e.g., race) exerts its impact on outcome variables. Implications: Future studies in this area should use both quantitative and qualitative research methods to specify the pathways by which race, ethnicity, and culture affect the caregiving experience, and should expand their focus beyond the primary caregiver to include the effects of caregiving on families and networks.   African Americans ,  Asian Americans ,  Hispanic Americans ,  Alzheimer's disease Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDRacial, ethnic, and cultural variations in the nature and effects of the dementia caregiving experience have received increasing attention over the last decade. The older adult population in the United States is rapidly becoming more diverse. By the middle of the next century, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are expected to compose more than 30% of the nation's population age 65 and over, compared to about 15% in 1990 (Hobbs 1999   ). Assumptions about the nature of the dementia caregiving experience based on research using samples of White American caregivers may not hold true for other groups, and service delivery based on such assumptions may be inappropriate (Yeo 1996   ). By being aware of possible racial, ethnic, and cultural variations in the caregiving experience, health care professionals and policy makers can better meet the needs of the diverse groups of caregivers whom they serve. In addition to these practical benefits, contrasting the caregiving experience of different groups can also enhance the theoretical understanding of this experience by distinguishing its universal elements from those that are mediated by the norms, expectations, or experiences of a given cultural group (Patterson et al. 1998   ).The increased interest in cultural differences in dementia caregiving is illustrated by the accelerated rate at which articles on this topic are being published. Connell and Gibson 1997    reviewed 12 articles published between 1985 and 1996 that examined the impact of race, ethnicity, and culture on the caregiving experience. In the short time since the time period covered by that review, an additional 21 articles on this topic have been published. Connell and Gibson concluded that although the small body of literature they reviewed suggested several consistent variations in the caregiving experience when Whites were compared to African Americans or Latinos, many of the articles had significant methodological limitations. Among these limitations were the failure of many studies to use large or representative samples, include control groups, or test a clearly specified theoretical framework. The racial/ethnic groups examined by this earlier group of studies were limited: The majority of the studies (10 of 12) compared African Americans and Whites; of the remaining two, one compared Latinos and Whites and the other African Americans and Latinos.The purpose of the current study was to review recently published research on dementia caregiving that compares groups as defined by race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, or country of residence. This article will serve as an update to the Connell and Gibson 1997    review and will answer the following questions: (a) Are the substantive conclusions drawn from the 1997 review regarding between-group differences supported by the more recent body of literature? What new information does this current group of studies offer? (b) What important methodological issues are brought to light by recent cross-cultural dementia caregiving research? and (c) What are fruitful directions for future research in this area? Methods In order to facilitate comparisons with the body of literature identified by Connell and Gibson 1997   , similar search strategies and terms were used to identify appropriate studies for the current review. Articles were sought that compared two or more racial, ethnic, cultural, or national groups on variables related to the dementia caregiving experience. The search was conducted using the following electronic databases: Medline, PsycInfo, Sociofile, and CINAHL. Search terms used were: African Americans, Alzheimer disease, Asian Americans, Blacks, caregivers, caregiving, dementia, ethnicity, ethnic minorities, Hispanic Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, minorities, race, racial differences, Whites.The current review includes articles published between 1996 and 2000 that were not included in the 1997 review. As with the earlier review, articles that focused on just one racial, ethnic, or cultural group were excluded (e.g., Sterritt and Pokorny 1998   ), as were book chapters, unpublished dissertations, and empirical studies on dementia caregiving that include race/ethnicity as a variable but do not have ethnic differences as a main research question (e.g., Miller and Mukherjee 1999   ).Also omitted were articles that examine racial/ethnic differences in the nondementia caregiving experience (e.g., Tennstedt, Chang, and Delgado 1998   ). Compared with general caregiving, dementia caregiving requires more hours per week and is also more likely to result in employment complications, strain, mental and physical health problems, reduced leisure time, and family conflict (Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, and Schulz 1999   ). Dementia caregiving is thus sufficiently unique in the "extreme challenges" it poses (Schulz, O'Brien, Bookwala, and Fleissner 1995   ) that it merits a separate analysis. Moreover, cultural factors may play a larger role in the context of dementia caregiving than in caregiving for other illnesses. Cultural norms vary regarding the meaning and degree of stigma associated with cognitive impairment in old age; these norms may determine patterns of interaction with the health and social services system and health care decision making, and may also have implications for the psychosocial experience of family members (Yeo 1996   ).After articles were identified, they were assessed according to four guidelines in order to answer the three research questions. Specifically, we assessed: (1) the groups examined in each article, (2) study sample composition and source, (3) the data collection methods used, and (4) the between-group differences, if any, that were observed in the outcomes of interest. Results To simplify cross-study comparisons,  Table 1  provides, where possible, detailed information about the samples (i.e., size, source, relation to care recipient, gender) used in each of the articles included in this review. In addition, the data collection methods and primary outcomes of interest—that is, the main variables or models on which the study groups were compared—are also described. Studies are presented in chronological order. Sample Selection The articles included in this review were heterogeneous both in the selection of target groups and in the outcomes of interest. Eight studies compared samples of White and African American caregivers; one compared samples of White, African American, and Latino caregivers; one compared White and Latino caregivers; one compared African American and Chinese American caregivers; one compared African American and Latino caregivers; one compared African American, Latino, Chinese American, and Irish American caregivers; and another focused on differences between Irish American and Latino caregivers. An additional seven studies included samples drawn from outside the United States: two articles looked at different research questions using the same sample of Chinese and American caregivers; two articles explored outcomes in the same sample of Korean and American caregivers; another compared Korean, Korean American, and White American caregivers; and two articles used data from a study comparing caregivers in 14 European Union countries. The total sample sizes ranged from 20 (Weitzman, Chee, and Levkoff 1999   ) to 2,947 (Kosloski, Montgomery, and Karner 1999   ). Although a few studies had criteria for caregiver age (Farran, Miller, Kaufman, and Davis 1997   ) or relationship to care recipient (e.g., Gonzales 1997   ; Lee and Sung 1997   ), most did not. Virtually all samples were recruited from clinical settings and/or from community sources serving dementia patients and their families, with the sole exception being a sample identified in an epidemiological survey in China (Patterson et al. 1998   ; Shaw et al. 1997   ).Where there were no selection criteria in terms of age or relationship, several consistent findings emerged regarding sample composition. White caregivers were more likely to be spouses compared to African Americans (Cox 1996   ; Cox 1999b   ; Gonzales 1997   ; Haley, Roth, Coleton, Ford, and West 1996   ; Kosloski et al. 1999   ), to Latinos (Harwood et al. 1998   ; Kosloski et al. 1999   ), and to Korean Americans (Youn, Knight, Jeong, and Benton 1999   ). In one study comparing African Americans to Latinos, Latino caregivers were more likely to be adult children and African American caregivers were more likely to be extended relatives (Cox and Monk 1996   ). Data Collection Methods The overwhelming majority of studies in this review reported data that were collected via in-person interviews or written surveys, often using standardized psychosocial instruments common in caregiving research. These data were analyzed statistically to determine the significance of between-group differences in mean levels of variables or in models of psychosocial processes. Four articles, however, described findings obtained through qualitative research methods. One used a semistructured interview protocol with open-ended questions to explore caregiving-related difficulties, rewards, and support (Murray, Schneider, Banerjee, and Mann 1999   ). The other three articles were based on a set of unstructured, in-home interviews that enabled the interviewer to explore caregiving-related themes that arose during the course of the interview (Hinton and Levkoff 1999   ; Ortiz, Simmons, and Hinton 1999   ; Weitzman et al. 1999   ). One study (Knight and McCallum 1998   ) used laboratory data (measurements of physiological stress. Observed Between-Group Differences  Table 2  shows the findings of all studies, in chronological order, regarding differences observed in the primary outcome variables between the study groups as defined by the authors. Where standard instruments were used, references are provided. Primary outcomes, as well as other variables measured in the studies, fell into the following categories: burden and psychological distress, coping strategies and stressfulness appraisal, social support, outcomes relating to use of health or social services, and illness meanings and representations. Burden and Psychological Distress When Whites were compared to African Americans, findings were mixed regarding caregiving-related burden and psychological distress. Two studies using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES–D; Radloff 1977   ) found that Whites had more depressive symptomatology than African Americans (Farran et al. 1997   ; Haley et al. 1996   ), but two others did not (Cox 1999b   ; Knight and McCallum 1998   ). In two studies that compared caregiving burden between African Americans and Whites (using different measures), one found that African American caregivers had lower levels of burden (Knight, Silverstein, McCallum, and Fox 2000   ), while no between-group differences were found in the other (Cox 1999a   , Cox 1999b   ). Cox 1996    found that White caregivers felt more restricted in their activities than African Americans and had more financial difficulties as a result of caregiving. Of the studies involving Latino caregivers, one found that Latino caregivers had more depressive symptomatology than Whites, and that the predictors of depression varied by ethnicity and relationship to patient (Harwood et al. 1998   ). Another study found that Latino caregivers had higher levels of personal and role strain than African American caregivers (Cox and Monk 1996   ).The studies involving Asian and Asian American samples also presented mixed findings regarding burden and psychological distress. Lee and Sung 1998    found that Korean caregivers had more developmental and social burden than American caregivers, and another study (Youn et al. 1999   ) found that Korean and Korean American caregivers who were children or children-in-law of the patient had higher levels of burden related to anger/embarrassment than their White counterparts. No differences in depression among White American, Korean American, and Korean caregivers were discovered in this study when demographics and health were controlled (Youn et al. 1999   ). Shaw and colleagues 1997    found that U.S. caregivers had elevated rates of depression and anxiety compared to controls, but Chinese caregivers did not. Schneider and colleagues 1999    noted that there were between-country differences in burden and distress among caregivers in 14 European Union countries but that caregivers in all countries had high levels of these two constructs. Stressfulness Appraisal and Coping Strategies Compared to White caregivers, Haley and colleagues 1996    and Farran and coworkers 1997    found that African American caregivers appraised patient-related problems as less stressful; Gonzales 1997    found that African American and White female caregivers appraised memory-related behaviors or depression symptoms in care recipients equally but that Whites found disruptive behaviors more stressful. Results from the Gonzales study also showed that African Americans exhibited higher levels of "resourcefulness," or skills used to self-regulate internal or external stressful events, but that there were no differences in frequency of use of coping strategies. Compared to Whites, African American caregivers were found to report greater use of positive reappraisal (Knight and McCallum 1998   ) and to derive higher levels of day-to-day and spiritual meaning from caregiving (Farran et al. 1997   ); one study, however, found no African American–White differences in personal gain from the caregiving experience (Cox 1999b   ). The only study in the current review that included a measure of religious practices (i.e., prayer and church attendance) found no differences between African Americans and Whites (Haley et al. 1996   ), but another study reported that African Americans found more spiritual meaning in caregiving than did Whites (Farran et al. 1997   ).Two studies employed structural equation modeling techniques to determine differences in the processes by which race affected emotional distress, and both examined coping as an important mediator in this process. Haley and colleagues 1996    found that African American caregivers used less approach and avoidance coping than White caregivers; they found that less use of avoidant coping, as well as lower stress appraisal, may contribute to the lower levels of depression observed in this group. Knight and associates 2000    found that the African American caregivers in their sample used more emotion-focused coping (conceptually similar to avoidance coping), and that while this led to greater emotional distress, the lower burden scores among this group served as a "counterbalance" so that overall distress scores were similar to those of the White sample.Regarding coping in other groups, Lee and Sung 1998    found that U.S. caregivers used more coping strategies than Koreans. Shaw and coworkers 1997    took an in-depth look at coping in samples of Chinese and U.S. caregivers and controls. Based on a factor analysis of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (Folkman and Lazarus 1988   ) in both samples, they constructed a scale made up of four factors that were consistent across groups. They found that there were no between-country differences in the use of behavioral confronting (e.g., "Stood my ground and fought") or cognitive distancing (e.g., "Refused to think about it"). Both cognitive confronting (e.g., "Just accepted it") and behavioral distancing/social support (e.g., "Asked someone for advice") were more prevalent in the Chinese sample. Greater use of coping strategies was associated with greater distress in the U.S. sample only.Several studies employed qualitative data-gathering and analytic techniques to learn more about the subjective experience of diverse groups of caregivers regarding caregiving-related difficulties and coping strategies. Ortiz and colleagues 1999    collected data on these phenomena from narratives elicited from interviews with Latino and Irish American caregivers of demented elders. They found that both groups invoked the notion of homelands when relating stories of coping or burden. Many of the Irish American caregivers drew comfort from an idealized version of Ireland and Irish culture, and also discussed resources available to them within their current community. Some of the Latino caregivers, in contrast, spoke about their homeland in the context of often tragic life histories, of which dementia was sometimes seen as a result, and also discussed the difficulties they had with accessing services in their community. In another qualitative study, no major differences were found between Chinese American and African American caregivers in the types of strategies they used to deal with caregiving-related interpersonal conflict, and most in each group used advanced social cognitive skills (i.e., they acknowledged the needs and viewpoints of the other person). However, in those cases where less adaptive strategies were used, Chinese American caregivers used more "directive" strategies and African Americans more "avoidant" (Weitzman et al. 1999   ).In response to general questions about the challenges and rewards of caregiving, as well as perceived social reactions and support, Murray and coworkers 1999    found that caregivers in 14 different European Union countries described their experiences in similar ways. The authors concluded that in spite of between-country differences in levels of government support for caregivers and laws regarding family caregiving duty, there were no obvious qualitative differences in the caregiving experience. Social Support In the current review, a number of studies addressed between-group differences in social or informal support. One study (Cox 1996   ) found that African Americans were less satisfied with their informal support than were Whites. Cox 1999a    found that African Americans were more satisfied with overall support. A third study (Haley et al. 1996   ) found no African American–White differences in social support. No differences in informal support were found between African American and Latino caregivers by Cox and Monk 1996   . One study found that Korean caregivers had more extended family support than White U.S. caregivers (Lee and Sung 1998   ), whereas in another, White American caregivers reported more emotional support than Korean and Korean American caregivers, and both U.S. groups reported more instrumental support than their Korean counterparts (Youn et al. 1999   ). The latter study found, however, that Korean caregivers reported the highest levels of familism, followed by Korean American and White American caregivers. U.S. caregivers and controls were also found to have more emotional support than Chinese caregivers and controls (Patterson et al. 1998   ). Service Utilization Four articles described outcomes related to service utilization. One study found that "need" variables (primarily the functional status of the patient) were more predictive of respite use and meal services (considered "discretionary" services) among Latinos than among African Americans and Whites, although need variables predicted home health care use (considered a "nondiscretionary" service) equally in all three groups (Kosloski et al. 1999   ). Another study found few differences between African Americans and Whites in perceived need for Alzheimer's Association services, and no differences in actual service use (Cox 1999b   ). Further analyses on this sample showed that "need" factors (patient status and caregiver burden), but not race, predicted support group membership and service use one year after contact with the Alzheimer's Association (Cox 1999a   ). Results from a fourth study (Cox 1996   ) indicated that although there were no African American–White differences in satisfaction with hospital discharge outcomes or predictors of these outcomes, African Americans were less satisfied with the discharge planning process (Cox 1996   ). Two studies measured use of formal services: One indicated that African Americans used more formal home care than Whites (Cox 1996   ), and the other found no African American–White differences in use of formal services (Haley et al. 1996   ). Illness Meaning and Representations One qualitative study explored differences across cultures in ideas about the nature and meaning of dementing illness among caregivers. Hinton and Levkoff 1999    found both consistencies and differences among family caregivers from four ethnic groups in the Boston area. African American, Chinese American, and Irish American caregivers all talked about Alzheimer's disease as a "loss of identity" or "loss of self." Chinese American caregivers tended to view the disease with less trepidation than other groups, perhaps because of cultural beliefs that normalize confusion in old age, and focused on filial duties when relating their stories. Puerto Rican caregivers tended to view the disease as a result of past personal or family tragedies. Discussion The current review of racial, ethnic, cultural, or national differences in the dementia caregiving experience expands considerably on the findings from an earlier review on this topic (Connell and Gibson 1997   ), in terms of both groups examined and range of outcomes assessed. Sample Demographics As in Connell and Gibson 1997    review on this topic, the current review reveals that African American and Latino caregivers are less likely than Whites to be spouses and more likely to be another family member. In one study from the current review, this was also true of Korean and Korean American caregivers (Youn et al. 1999   ). These findings are consistent with literature on general caregiving among these groups. For example, Burton and colleagues 1995    found that older, disabled Whites were more likely than Blacks to have a spouse caregiver, and they point out that this is a reflection of differences in these groups in marital status. In cultures with Confucian values, the norm of the eldest son and daughter-in-law providing care to aging parents is well recognized (Braun and Browne 1998   ). The greater likelihood of caregivers in non-White groups being younger relatives—who may be employed with families of their own—should thus be considered in the design of service programs to address the needs of dementia caregivers. Burden and Psychological Distress Connell and Gibson 1997    found in the earlier group of studies that, with several exceptions, White caregivers reported higher levels of burden and depression than African American caregivers. Regarding depression, these findings were only partially corroborated by the more recent research reviewed here, even when the same measure, the CES–D, was used across studies. One reason for this inconsistency may be noncomparability of samples, in terms of geographic residence, socioeconomic status (SES), or other characteristics. Also, because spouse caregivers tend to have higher levels of depression than other caregivers (Schulz et al. 1995   ), relationship to patient may be a confounding factor when samples are mixed and caregiver relationship is not controlled for statistically (e.g., Cox 1999b   ; Haley et al. 1996   ).The studies involving Korean, Chinese, and Korean American samples also presented mixed findings regarding burden and depression. Researchers have speculated that the more normative nature of caregiving in Eastern cultures may be protective against distress (Shaw et al. 1997   ) just as it may be in African American cultures (Haley et al. 1996   ). The qualitative research reviewed here on Chinese American caregivers supports, to some extent, this hypothesis (Hinton and Levkoff 1999   ), as does Shaw and colleagues 1997    finding that U.S. caregivers had more depression compared to controls, whereas Chinese caregivers did not. Other scholars have suggested, however, that dementia symptoms may sometimes be a source of shame in Asian or Asian American cultures (Braun and Browne 1998   ), which may help to explain why Korean American adult-child caregivers scored high on an Anger/Embarassment scale (Youn et al. 1999   ). Clearly, existing research on Asian American caregivers is minimal, and it is premature to draw conclusions about the impact of cultural factors on the caregiving experience among Asian American groups.It is also important to note that baseline depression level may vary among ethnic groups, although comparable mental health data on U.S. minority groups are limited (Jackson, Antonucci, and Gibson 1995   ), and there are few psychiatric epidemiological studies of Asian Americans (Kang and Kang 1995   ). The National Comorbidity Survey revealed that African Americans have a lower prevalence of affective disorders than Whites, and that Hispanics have a higher prevalence (Kessler et al. 1994   ). Thus, differences in psychological distress found in the current review may not be due to a more negative impact of caregiving on these groups, but may instead be a reflection of baseline differences in these groups. Coping and Stressfulness Appraisal As in the Connell and Gibson 1997    review, several studies in the current review suggested that African Americans appraise aspects of caregiving as less stressful than Whites, and that they derive more benefit and meaning from the experience (Farran et al. 1997   ; Gonzales 1997   ; Haley et al. 1996   ; Knight and McCallum 1998   ). No clear-cut patterns involving the use of coping strategies among different groups were discernible, however. In their review, Connell and Gibson 1997    noted that African American caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to use religious coping. Although religious coping was not examined specifically in the current review of articles, one study found no differences in religious practices between African Americans and Whites (Haley et al. 1996   ).Some of the more methodologically innovative studies in this review examined coping strategies. Three studies tested models of the caregiving stress process in samples of African American and White caregivers (Haley et al. 1996   ; Knight et al. 2000   ; Patterson et al. 1998   ). Another compared the factor structure of a commonly used coping instrument (Ways of Coping–Revised; Folkman and Lazarus 1988   ) in Chinese and U.S. caregivers, after first attempting to construct a conceptually comparable version of the instrument in Chinese. Such studies are important in that they provide information about culturally based reasons for differential psychosocial outcomes between groups, as coping is likely to be influenced to a large extent by cultural factors (Aranda and Knight 1997   ). The qualitative studies in the current review offer some additional insight into how specific strategies for coping with the demands of caregiving vary across groups, although the strategies described may be sample-specific and results should be generalized with caution. Unfortunately, cross-cultural research on coping in general, which might serve as useful context for caregiving-specific findings, remains sparse. Social Support Cultural norms and structural conditions are likely to influence the extent to which support is available to caregivers (Aranda and Knight 1997   ; Dilworth-Anderson and Burton 1999   ; Miller, Randolph, Kaufman, Dargan, and Banks 2000   ). The mixed findings in the current review regarding perceived support suggest that non-White caregivers may not have more informal support available to them than White caregivers, contrary to assumptions often made about the extensive social networks of ethnic minorities. Researchers elsewhere have questioned this assumption: Roschelle 1997    has found evidence that African Americans may be disadvantaged in terms of social relations compared to Whites, and attributes this phenomenon to the continuing structural, economic, and social discrimination that has eroded traditional networks in African American and other minority communities. Miller and colleagues 2000    have also noted that policies such as the welfare reform act of 1996 may have a negative impact on traditional family supports among African Americans.Research on nondementia caregiving provides additional evidence that the informal caregiving networks of elderly disabled Blacks are not larger than those of Whites (Burton et al. 1995   ), although Tennstedt and coworkers 1998    found that African American and Puerto Rican elders received more informal care than Whites. Nonetheless, policymakers should not assume that lack of use of formal care among minority groups is due to a greater likelihood of these groups receiving informal care (Burton et al. 1995   ); nor should program planners assume that members of minority groups receive sufficient support from existing networks. Service Utilization Outcomes related to use of health or social services in the articles included in this review were limited, as were the groups examined on these variables. Cox 1996    found that African American caregivers were less satisfied with hospital discharge planning than Whites, and that African American caregivers used more formal home care than Whites. Cox also suggests that there may be issues related to underutilization of Alzheimer Association services that transcend African American/White differences in the dementia caregiving experience (Cox 1999a   , Cox 1999b   ). Kosloski and associates 1999    found that a patient's functional status was more important among Latinos than among African Americans or Whites in predicting the use of community health services; they suggest that this could reflect decreased access to services among Latinos. Finally, the qualitative study by Ortiz and colleagues 1999    provides insight into the types of barriers Latinos may experience to accessing services, such as difficulties navigating bureaucracies.Differences in access to services may be a result of cultural preferences, language limitations, institutional exclusions, or financial barriers (Aranda and Knight 1997   ; Wallace, Campbell, and Lew-Ting 1994   ), and differential use by elderly people of health and social services across racial/ethnic groups has received considerable attention elsewhere. Although minorities make less use of institutional long-term care, there is mixed evidence regarding use of community long-term care services (Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kington, and Andersen 1998   ). For example, one study found that elderly Latinos obtained less paid assistance than similar non-Latino Whites (Wallace, Levy-Storms, and Ferguson 1995   ); yet, Miller and associates 1996    found no differences among African American, Hispanic, or White frail older persons in use of community-based long-term services.Although dementia-specific studies are lacking, it has been found that African Americans with Alzheimer's disease spend a longer time in the community prior to nursing home admission, suggesting that there may be substantial unmet need on the part of their caregivers (Miller and Mukherjee 1999   ). A similar phenomenon may be present among Latinos: Harwood and coworkers 1998    found that the Latino patients presenting to a university memory clinic were more cognitively impaired and had a longer duration of illness than their White counterparts. A more systematic and in-depth look at use of dementia services by diverse groups of caregivers is thus warranted. Methodological Issues The current studies highlight the importance of a number of methodological issues related to cross-cultural research on dementia caregiving. The first of these is the extent to which the nonequivalence of measures in different cultural and linguistic contexts is addressed by researchers. This concern is notoriously difficult to address, because mere translation (or back-translation) of instruments does not ensure equivalence of meaning (Padgett 1995   ; Patterson et al. 1998   ). However, the current group of articles offers one excellent example of how researchers can strive for cross-cultural measurement equivalence: the factor analysis of a coping scale by Shaw and colleagues 1997    in Chinese and U.S. samples. Other researchers in the studies reviewed have noted the problem of cross-cultural measurement and conceptual equivalence and addressed the issue in the discussion of their results. Youn and coworkers 1999   , for example, noted that the construct of familism has different meanings in different cultures, suggesting that in Korean culture "familism does not seem to reflect a strong tradition of mutual support, as is hypothesized to be true of African American and of Latino caregivers in the U.S." (p. 362). Rather, Korean daughters-in-law provide care out of a sense of duty, and this role often brings conflict. The high level of familism among Korean caregivers may not, therefore, protect them from burden, as seen in their empirical work reviewed here (Youn et al. 1999   ).A related concern is the extent to which measures that examine caregiving-related outcomes capture the true impact of caregiving across different cultures. For example, the finding in many studies that African American caregivers tend to have less caregiving-related stress and burden than White American caregivers may not mean that the negative impact of caregiving is less in this group, but rather that this impact is manifested in a different way; for example, in greater physical health problems. It has been suggested, for example, that African Americans of low SES who tend to use active coping strategies in response to stressors in their environment may be at elevated risk for hypertension compared to Whites at the same level of active coping (James, Strogatz, Wing, and Ramsey 1987   ). The tendency of Asian Americans to somaticize emotional distress has also been noted (Braun and Browne 1998   ), and this tendency has been found among African American and Puerto Rican women as well (Calderon and Tennstedt 1998   ).The absence of control groups from virtually all studies in the current review suggests another important methodological issue. Only two studies (based on the same sample) included a noncaregiving control sample (Patterson et al. 1998   ; Shaw et al. 1997   ). As noted earlier, because baseline levels of conditions such as depression may vary by ethnic group, it is difficult to know whether such differences can be attributed to the caregiving experience in the absence of a noncaregiving comparison group. Although differences not due to caregiving may also have implications for service provision to diverse groups, the question about a differential impact of the caregiving experience on certain variables remains unanswered. In other words, cross-cultural studies without noncaregiving control groups ultimately measure levels of the variables of interest (e.g., distress) among different groups of caregivers, as opposed to the differential impact of caregiving on these variables. The findings of Shaw and colleagues 1997    and Patterson and colleagues 1998    highlight the utility of employing a control group, as several between-group differences were identified between Chinese and U.S. samples (including when controls were compared) that may have otherwise been erroneously attributed to differential effects of caregiving.An additional important methodological issue concerns the appropriateness of attributing differences between groups of dementia caregivers to the "grouping variable"—race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, or country of residence. When grouping caregivers by any of these categories, researchers should have a clear idea about the hypothesized mechanism by which membership in this category can affect the caregiving experience. In general, effects of the grouping variable may be due to cultural factors (the symbolic and normative aspects of social life, such as language, values, beliefs, or norms; Angel and Angel 1995   ) or minority status (Aranda and Knight 1997   ), with the latter implying the effects of inequality and discrimination, factors that continue to play a major role in the lives of minority group members in the United States and affect psychosocial outcomes in these groups (Jackson et al. 1995   ).When race is used as a grouping variable, therefore, it is not clear if African American outcomes should be attributed to their cultural distinctiveness or minority status (Manuel 2000   )—a distinction that is not always clear. For example, patterns of social support in minority groups are shaped both by culture and by economics (Dilworth-Anderson and Burton 1999   ). While controlling for SES may help to determine whether cultural, and not structural/economic factors, are responsible for differential outcomes, the hypothesized cultural factors should still be measured (Mutran 1985   ). This is particularly important in light of evidence that, after controlling for indicators of SES in African American and White samples, residual SES-related confounding factors (such as greater wealth among Whites even at the same income level) often remain such that apparent between-group differences may be spurious (Kaufman, Cooper, and McGee 1997   ). Manuel 2000    further suggests that researchers should consider modeling multiple indicators of race, or its hypothesized effects, and to account for measurement error in race when using this "muddled and vacuous" (p. 14) concept as a predictor variable.Many, but not all, of the studies reviewed controlled for indicators of SES; far fewer attempted to measure alternative cultural pathways by which group membership might exert its effect on the caregiving experience. A number of authors, however, did put forth explanations for observed between-group differences that invoked both cultural factors and minority group status as reasons for differences in outcome variables. For example, Haley and colleagues 1996    cite explanations that would fall under both categories (e.g., that African American caregivers may be particularly effective at using appraisal and coping due to a greater tolerance for behavioral disturbance in family members and a greater exposure to and mastery of life stress). Farran and coworkers 1997    speculate that African American culture encourages adaptation to difficult situations through positive appraisal, and that African Americans may not have the "luxury" of being depressed by external circumstances. Cox 1996    alluded to the potential role of discrimination in bringing about an important finding in her study; that is, that the greater dissatisfaction with discharge planning among African Americans may have been due to hospital staff involving this group less in the process.The challenge of accurately attributing differences in caregivers to specific aspects of group membership is compounded by the substantial within-group heterogeneity found in all the groups by which dementia caregivers were classified in the current review. This heterogeneity both adds to the complexity of the causal path between the grouping variable (e.g., ethnicity) and outcome, and also limits the extent to which findings from a single study can be generalized to broadly conceived groups such as those represented by the U.S. census categories (i.e., American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, African American, Latino origin). Yeo 1996    suggests that the most important source of intragroup variability within these census categories is national (or tribal) origin and culture. Even within subcategories by origin, however, there is still diversity in terms of acculturation and ethnic identity, education, income, length of residence in the United States, rural or urban background, religious affiliation and participation, and family support (Yeo 1996   ). This diversity, of course, also characterizes groups of caregivers who reside outside of the United States and are identified in studies only by their country of residence. Bhopal and Donaldson 1998    discuss the potential dangers of using broad categories such as race and ethnicity that have dubious scientific or anthropological validity, and suggest that it is incumbent on researchers to describe the samples used "to make clear the basis of racial or ethnic classification (e.g., ancestry, geographic origin, birthplace, language, religion, migration history)" (Bhopal and Donaldson 1998   , p. 1306).The implications of sample composition received some limited attention in the current group of studies; for example, groups of Latino caregivers were identified by national origin (Cox and Monk 1996   ; Harwood et al. 1998   ; Hinton and Levkoff 1999   ; Ortiz et al. 1999   ), although only one of these studies included a measure of acculturation (Cox and Monk 1996   ). Other studies acknowledged the possible implications of within-group variability among groups with the same national origin; for example, Knight and coworkers 2000    note that their findings regarding coping strategies among African Americans may have differed from those in a prior study (Haley et al. 1996   ), because the samples were from different regions with different histories and social contexts. Interestingly, no study made note of the race/ethnicity of care recipients, with the implied assumption being that patients were always of the same background as caregivers. With the increasing number of interethnic and interracial families in the United States, however, researchers will not be able to make this assumption, and indeed, dementia caregiving in families of mixed cultures merits examination. Conclusions As a group, the studies reviewed here and previously (Connell and Gibson 1997   ) suggest that there may be differences in the stress process, in psychosocial outcomes, and in variables related to service utilization among caregivers of different racial, ethnic, national, and cultural groups; however, the origin of these differences is often unclear, as is the extent to which they can be generalized beyond the samples employed in a given study. Further studies that include noncaregiving control groups and detailed models of the hypothesized pathways leading from the grouping variable (e.g., ethnicity or culture) to outcomes are clearly needed.Future cross-cultural caregiving research should address several additional issues. First, the paradigm of the "primary caregiver" may not be equally applicable in all cultures. Future studies should expand their focus beyond the primary caregiver and include individuals from the entire family system as well as non-kin (Aranda and Knight 1997   ; Dilworth-Anderson and Burton 1999   ). Such inclusiveness will better capture the diversity of the caregiving experience among different racial, ethnic, or cultural groups. Aranda and Knight 1997    note, for example, that in Latino families stress may be more likely to arise from disruption to the family unit rather than from a negative impact of caregiving on individual perceived control. Strategies for measuring such family- or network-level variables, therefore, need to be conceptualized and tested.Research that examines the impact of immigration or acculturation status on the dementia caregiving experience is needed. Aranda and Knight 1997    argue that a unique set of caregiving conflicts may arise in immigrant cultures when family members are at different levels of acculturation and have correspondingly different values or beliefs related to caregiving. Youn and coworkers 1999    noted the potential additional burden on Korean American dementia caregivers caused by the internal conflict between Korean and American values. Acculturative stress and other factors associated with immigrant status (such as cultural and economic barriers to care) may also interact with the caregiving experience, resulting in potentially greater burden and distress. The inclusion of detailed measures of acculturation in future studies of the caregiving experience may help to "tease out" some of these effects. In addition, because gender roles may be affected by immigration and acculturation, future research should address how changing norms and beliefs regarding these roles affect the dementia caregiving experience.Finally, the limited body of qualitative or ethnographic research on the dementia caregiving experience should be expanded. Dilworth-Anderson and Burton 1999    argue that ethnographic studies on older minorities can uncover cultural differences that survey research cannot. Such studies may be particularly useful in identifying the elusive "cultural" factors that lead to different between-group outcomes in quantitative studies. Findings in the current review also suggest how this type of research may help to inform the content of interventions. For example, variations in how caregivers from different cultural groups perceive the nature and cause of their loved one's illness (e.g., Hinton and Levkoff 1999   ) may be helpful in designing support activities that are meaningful to members of these groups. Knowledge and attitudes regarding health and social services are also critical topics to explore within a qualitative research paradigm, in order to determine the specific nature of structural and cultural factors affecting service use and to improve outreach efforts to diverse groups of caregivers.

     Abstract Purpose: This study assessed the extent to which community-dwelling rural older adults mismanage their prescription medication regimens and predicted mismanagement of medications from selected socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile char-acteristics. Design and Methods: Personal interviews with 499 community-dwelling adults aged 66 and over taking at least one prescription medication and living in a rural region of the Southeast. With approximately equal numbers of African American and white men and women, the SUDAAN multiple logistic regression procedure was used to predict the mismanagement of prescription medications. Results: The mismanagement of prescribed medication regimens is relatively common among older adults. Those more likely than others to mismanage their regimens are African American, younger, in poorer mental health, with more acute care physician visits, and those who find payment for their medications to be problematic. Implications: The implications of the findings for what is known about the self-modification of drug regimens, targeting prescription drug cost benefits or interventions, and the limitations of the study are discussed.

(nonsolicited correspondence from a 62-year-old woman)Although those aged 65 years and older make up 12% of the population, they consume over 30% of all prescription medications (Baum, Kennedy, Knapp, Faich, and Nello 1987   ; Mueller, Schur, and O'Connell 1997   ; Soumerai and Ross-Degnan 1999   ). Many take several medications simultaneously for multiple chronic conditions. Studies show that, depending upon the population sampled, from 75% to 92% of older adults take at least one prescription medication, with the average older person taking between two and four (Fillenbaum et al. 1993   ; Helling et al. 1987   ; Moller and Mathiowetz 1989   ; Stoller 1988   ). In 1996, an average of 5.5 outpatient prescriptions were written for those aged 55–64, compared with more than 8 for those aged 65 and older (Copeland 1999   ). Prescription drug expenditures, moreover, grew at double-digit rates during almost every year since 1980, accelerating to 14.1% in 1997 while total national health expenditures decreased (Copeland 1999   ). These trends translate into greater per capita spending on prescription drugs among the elderly population compared to other age groups (Copeland 1999   ; Mueller et al. 1997   ). Researchers, service providers, and policy makers contend that the escalating cost of prescription drugs is a serious problem that threatens health maintenance and recovery from acute illness episodes among elderly people (Blustein 2000   ; Rogowski, Lillard, and Kington 1997   ; Soumerai and Ross-Degnan 1999   ).At the federal level, Congress is considering revising the Medicare program to include a prescription drug benefit and whether or not to means test such a benefit (Christensen and Wagner 2000   ; McKercher 1997   ; Poisal, Murray, Chulis, and Cooper 1999   ). Some states have adjusted Medicaid drug benefits in an attempt to reduce costs. New Hampshire recently changed its Medicaid policy from unlimited prescription drug coverage to three drugs per month. Those evaluating the effects of this change noted that the use of essential medications among elderly and disabled persons declined significantly (Soumerai, Avorn, Ross-Degnan, and Gortmaker 1987   ), and they found chronically ill elderly persons to be twice as likely as controls to enter nursing homes, often permanently, costing far more than what was saved in drug expenditures (Soumerai, McLaughlin, Ross-Degnan, Casteris, and Bollini 1994   ). Glickman, Bruce, Caro, and Avorn 1994    interviewed physicians following the New Hampshire Medicaid policy change, and 85% of them said that patients had told them about their inability to afford prescribed drugs.Despite concern about the effect of medication noncompliance upon chronic illness trajectory, use of emergency medical care, and premature institutionalization among elderly people, little is known about what older adults themselves do in response to the rising cost of prescription medications. Rafoul 1986    and Giannetti 1983    have outlined numerous strategies that elderly people use to cope with medication costs, including failure to fill prescriptions, saving medication for future use, forgoing one medication for another, taking less than the recommended dosage, and taking medication prescribed for another person. While these strategies can have important and deleterious effects, particularly when the use of essential drugs is curtailed, it is not clear in these two studies if such strategies are being employed deliberately by elderly people to manage costs or result, instead, from lack of understanding about the appropriate use of medications. It is well established in the literature that as the number of medications taken concurrently increases, so does the probability of misuse resulting from patient noncompliance or physician prescribing errors.Cooper, Love, and Rafoul 1982    categorize such noncompliance with medication regimens among elders as either intentional or nonintentional. The most common reason for intentional noncompliance among older adults is stopping medication use prematurely because they feel better (Rafoul 1986   ). Other forms of intentional noncompliance include stopping medication use prematurely because of unpleasant side effects (McGrath 1999   ), failure to understand the necessity of the medication, forgetfulness or cognitive impairment (Hanlon et al. 1996   ; McGrath 1999   ) or inability to afford high prescription drug costs (e.g., Bazargan, Barbre, and Hamm 1993   ; Cooper et al. 1982   ; Levit et al. 1998   ).Our goals in this study were to document the use of medication mismanagement in a sample of noninstitutionalized, rural elderly people. The dependent variable is the self-reported use of nine different noncompliant strategies to manage prescription drug regimens. These strategies, shown in  Table 1  , were derived from transcripts of in-depth interviews with 200 community-dwelling elders who reported using alternative health care practices or practitioners (see Mitchell and Mathews 1992   ). The list is not intended to be exhaustive but to provide an estimate of how widespread the use of mismanagement strategies is in the study population.In order to understand more completely the role of cost in influencing compliance behaviors, it was necessary to document the extent of the problem in the sample population, especially the variable impact of cost on different subgroups. We also examined the role of self-reported health status as well as the characteristics of the medications used by elderly people in prescription drug mismanagement strategies. The following analysis attempts to determine the extent to which cost, health status, and knowledge about medications affect the mismanagement of (or noncompliance with) prescription drug regimens in subgroups within the overall sample.We hypothesized that several socioeconomic characteristics including income, income adequacy, education, residence, and cohabitation as an indicator of social support would affect mismanagement. Specifically, we hypothesized that elderly people who live alone, are rural residents, have less education, and those who have lower and less adequate incomes would be more likely than others to mismanage their prescription medications. We further hypothesized that older adults of advanced age, men, and African Americans would be more likely than their counterparts to mismanage their medications. Several studies report that African American older adults take fewer prescription medications than do Whites (Fillenbaum et al. 1993   , Fillenbaum et al. 1996   ; Khandker and Simoni-Wastila 1998   ; Kotzan, Carroll, and Kotzan 1989   ). This may be because fewer African American elders than Whites have supplementary insurance that pays for drugs (Bazargan et al. 1993   ), or, as suggested by Fillenbaum and colleagues 1996   , it may be because poorer communication between typically White physicians and African American patients leads to noncompliance and/or inappropriate treatment.Health status indicators hypothesized to affect mismanagement include physician visits for acute symptoms as well as chronic comorbidity, self-reported mental health, and the ability to perform selected activities of daily living (ADLs) without assistance. We hypothesize that elderly people with more acute and chronic care physician visits, with poorer self-reported mental health, and those requiring more assistance performing ADLs will be more likely to mismanage medications.Finally, we include self-reported consultation by a physician about prescription drugs, the number of prescription medications currently taken, knowledge about what the medications are for, the retail cost of medications, the cost of medications to older persons, and the extent to which Medicaid spend-down or the cost of prescription drugs is a problem for the respondent as predictors of mismanagement. We hypothesize that those reporting consultation with their physician and with more knowledge of their medications are less likely than other older adults to mismanage medications, whereas those taking more medications, costlier medications, and those with problems paying for medications will be more likely than others to mismanage their medications. Methods Sample This analysis is based upon a subsample of 499 people taking one or more prescription medications from a total sample of 604 community-dwelling adults aged 66 years and older interviewed in their homes in eastern North Carolina. These community-dwelling respondents were selected randomly within race–gender categories with the goal of equal numbers of male and female African American and White elders. The sampling frame consisted of approximately 2,600 older adults interviewed between 5 and 6 years previously. Twenty-two older adults (13 White and 9 African American) from the study counties were trained to administer structured interviews in respondents' homes. Interviewers were matched with respondents by race. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status; self-reported acute symptoms, chronic illnesses, and subsequent physician visits; self-reported preventive health screening; self-reported ability to perform a variety of activities; self-reported mental health; and an inventory of prescription medications utilized currently by each respondent derived from drug label information. Measurement  Table 2  elaborates upon the characteristics of the sample of prescription drug users by describing the distributions of the variables included in the prediction of prescription drug mismanagement. Variables are categorized as socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile indicators. Continuous variables are coded such that a higher number reflects more of an attribute (e.g., better mental health). The coding of categorical variables will be described.Socioeconomic indicators in  Table 2  include age (in years), sex (female = 2, male = 1), and whether respondents are African American (African American = 1, White = 0). Consistent with sampling quotas, the proportions in the table show that the number of older adults by race and by sex is approximately equal. Next are two categorical measures: whether respondents live alone (yes = 2, no = 1) and residence (rural = 1, towns = 2, and cities = 3). Rural refers to farm or nonfarm residence in areas with no community name or residence in a rural crossroads community. Towns have populations between 2,500 and 10,000 people, and cities have populations over 10,000. The table shows that about one third of participants live alone and almost half (43%) live in a rural area.Educational attainment is measured such that the highest level, post high school, has a value of 3. Consistent with what would be expected in this largely rural region, just over 40% of the older adults had eighth grade educations or less, and one fifth had some post high school educational experience. Gross annual household income is measured by a series of 14 income categories ranging from under $3,000 to over $100,000 per year. They are coded such that a higher number indicates more annual income. About one third of the older adults had household incomes less than $7,000 per year and another one-third had incomes in excess of $10,000. Income adequacy is the summed response to three questions: worry about having enough income in the future, trouble making ends meet, and enough income for little extras. A higher number—between 3 and 10—indicates more adequate income.  Table 2  shows the mean value for income adequacy to be 7.1, indicating that the average respondent considers his or her income to be more adequate than inadequate.Health status indicators in  Table 1  begin with yes (coded 1) or no (coded 0) responses to visiting a physician for 13 acute symptoms that respondents had experienced in the past few months. The symptoms were taken from disease-specific (e.g., cancer, heart disease, or diabetes) warning signs. Across the 13 rather serious acute symptoms, the average number reported was 3 and the number resulting in a physician visit, shown in  Table 2  , averaged 2.2. Respondents were also asked whether they go to the doctor on a regular basis (e.g., every few months) for nine chronic conditions (arthritis, breathing problems such as asthma or emphysema, extremity circulation problems, diabetes, stomach or bowel problems such as ulcers, high blood pressure, heart trouble, cancer, and anxiety or depression). Responses to regularly seeing a physician for each problem were yes (coded 1) or no (coded 0). The typical respondent reported 2.3 physician visits associated with the chronic conditions. Responses to both measures of physician visits were summed across either acute symptoms or chronic conditions.A global approach to measuring mental health based upon self-evaluation was used rather than recall of information that may or may not be relevant to the daily lives of the older adults in our study population. Thus, mental health includes summed responses to seven items. They are: "Are you in good spirits most of the time?", "Do you often feel depressed?", "Do you often feel lonely?", "Are you frequently confused?", "Do you often feel anxious or worried about the future?" (yes, not sure, or no for each), overall self-rated mental health (excellent, good, fair, or poor), and mental health compared to 5 years ago (better, about the same, or worse). Responses to the items were coded so that a higher number reflects better mental health.Self-reported mental health was generally good. The range of mental health values was from 8 to 22, and  Table 2  shows that the average respondent had a self-reported mental health value of 18, quite high given the range. Internal consistency among the mental health items is also good (unrotated principal components factor loadings range from .58 to .72), and the internal reliability is reasonable (alpha = .75).Items indicating ability to perform personal care and independent in-home living activities were drawn from the Older Americans Resource Survey (OARS; Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Cornoni-Huntley, Huntley, and Feldman 1990   ), the Multidimensional Functional Assessment Instrument (Kane, Bell, Riegler, Wilson, and Kane 1983   ), and Lawton 1972    Philadelphia Geriatric Center Multilevel Assessment Instrument. Items were chosen to represent a full range of abilities conducive to in-home independent living in this community-dwelling population. Principal components factor analysis results (not shown) indicate that there are two dimensions of activities, each suggesting different in-home competencies. The first, physical ability, includes self-reported ability with no difficulty, some difficulty, much difficulty or inability to rise from a straight chair without arms, walk up and down at least two steps, bend down and pick up clothes from the floor, reach up and get down a 5 lb. bag of sugar from just overhead, get in and out of a car, get in and out of a bathtub, and cut toenails (alpha = .93). Personal care activities consist of difficulty dressing, getting in and out of bed, eating food, washing and drying one's body, using the toilet, and brushing one's teeth or dentures (alpha = .92). Responses to each of the summed measures are coded consistent with ability. Those with the least difficulty across the activities in each dimension have the highest numeric score.Measures used as indicators of the medication profile of respondents include the number of prescription medications currently taken. During the interview, respondents were asked to produce all of the prescription medications, including pills, capsules, ointments and creams, suppositories, and such they were currently taking. Interviewers recorded the form of each medication (e.g., ointment or capsule), the drug name, dosing regimen, and strength from the label.  Table 2  shows that the number of medications taken by respondents ranged between 1 and 14, with the average approaching 4 medications.Physician consultation is self-reported discussion by physicians of four topics, including medicines that should be taken, when to take them, lower cost medicines, and side effects. Yes (coded 2) or no (coded 1) responses to each are summed. During the interview, respondents were asked whether they knew the purpose of each medication that they were taking. A registered pharmacist coded each response using categories of incorrect (coded 1), partially correct or close (coded 2), or correct (coded 3). Respondents who admitted outright that they did not know what a medication was for were combined with those with attempted but incorrect responses. Because respondents took between 1 and 14 medications, the average response across medications was computed for each respondent, resulting in 171 values between 1 and 3. Judging from the range of values summed across medications for each respondent, it appears that the majority of the respondents indicated that they knew the appropriate use of each medication.Using the Red Book Advisory Board 1996    Red Book for the year the data were gathered, the registered pharmacist recorded the monthly retail cost, minus dispensing fee, of each medication based upon dosage and, using insurance or Medicaid coverage information, the cost of each medication to the respondent. At the time of the interview, Medicaid paid for up to four medications per enrollee. Because the distributions of these variables are skewed (see  Table 1  ), each value was converted to its base 10 logarithmic equivalent. The base 10 log was chosen because the effect of a tenfold increase on the dependent variable is easily interpreted. The final medication profile indicator consisted of responses to a query about difficulty paying for prescription medications or, for those enrolled, meeting Medicaid spend-down requirements.  Table 2  shows the distribution of respondents according to category of difficulty, coded such that the higher number represents more difficulty.The dependent variable as noted previously is the self-reported use of the nine strategies indicative of the mismanagement of prescription drug regimens shown in  Table 1  . Affirmative responses were coded 1, and the number of strategies used by each respondent were summed. Because over half (281 or 56.2%) of the respondents used no strategies, the distribution was skewed (M = 1.19, SD = 1.87). Consequently, for the multivariate analysis, mismanagement is dichotomized into one or more strategies (coded 1) versus no strategies (coded 0). Statistical Analysis Because the dependent variable is dichotomous, the main effects of the socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile indicators were assessed using the LOGISTIC procedure of the SUDAAN (release 7.11) statistical package (Shah, Barnwell, and Bieler 1996   ). This package adjusts the standard errors of prediction with nonrandom samples by population weighting according to the categories of a constructed variable consistent with sample selection criteria. Our sample size of approximately equal numbers of persons by race and gender was, consequently, adjusted using estimates of race- and gender-specific persons in the 33-county study region. Statistical results provide model parameter estimates that simulate random sample results of tests of the null hypothesis that regression coefficients are equal to 0. The LOGISTIC procedure is appropriate for the analysis of individual main effects and the overall significance of multivariate predictions of dependent Boolean variables with values of 0 and 1.In order to assess whether predictive effects are spurious and to look at change in predictive effectiveness as additional variables are added to the analysis, we examined the main effects of the predictive variables in three phases. The first includes only socioeconomic characteristics hypothesized to affect self-management strategies. Second, the effects of the health status characteristics are added. The third phase includes the effects of the combined socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile indicators. For each model, we report a chi-square goodness-of-fit value plus a multiple R2 estimate, similar to Aldrich and Nelson 1984    pseudo-R2 analog. Results  Table 1  shows that 29% of the older adults taking prescription medications reported either some or a great deal of difficulty paying for the cost of their prescription medications or meeting Medicaid spend-down requirements. Just over half reported no difficulty paying for their medications. This finding suggests that, for many older adults in this region, the cost of medications is a problem and potential health care risk. Given the income levels and other socioeconomic characteristics of the sample, however, the problem of drug costs is somewhat less serious than we had anticipated. Apparently drug costs are a problem for a sizable minority, but a clear majority of respondents do not feel that the cost of prescription medications is a problem for them. Table 1  shows that, even when the analysis is not restricted to more expensive medications, older adults use a variety of strategies to manage the cost of their prescription medications. Just under one fifth (83 or 17%) buy part of a prescription instead of all of it; 15% of respondents take less medicine than prescribed to make it last; and 19% ask their doctors for free samples. It is clear that a sizable proportion of respondents have difficulty either obtaining their medication or taking it as prescribed. Although the number of persons using any one strategy is not excessive, 44% use one or more self-management strategies and 19% or about one fifth, use three or more strategies. That almost half of the respondents use at least one strategy is of concern, as the use of even one indicates problems obtaining medication or difficulty complying with their medication regimen as prescribed. Logistic Regression Models The hypothesized main effects of the socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile indicators are shown by the odds ratios in  Table 3  . The values in the first column suggest that, among African Americans, the odds of mismanaging prescribed medications are increased by 1.40 compared to Whites. Mismanagement is slightly less common among older, compared to younger, respondents although the odds ratio is not particularly large. For each increase of one year in age, the odds of mismanaging prescription drugs decreases by 3%. The model χ2 and R2 estimates indicate that the prediction of mismanagement from only socioeconomic indicators is not particularly effective. Neither income nor income adequacy has much effect on mismanagement.The second column of odds ratios adds the hypothesized effects of the health status indicators to the socioeconomic characteristics in the prediction of prescription drug mismanagement. The odds ratios show that the only health status indicator that has a statistically significant effect on drug mismanagement is self-reported mental health. Specifically, for each improvement in the mental health measure of one unit, the mismanagement of prescription drugs decreases by about 13%. Controlling the effects of the health status indicators slightly strengthens the previously described effects of age and race on prescription medication mismanagement. Comparing χ2 and R2 estimates in the first and second columns, the addition of health status indicators only slightly improves the prediction.The third column of odds ratios in  Table 3  adds the effects of medication profile indicators in the prediction of prescription drug mismanagement. The odds ratios again show that an increase of one year in age results in a 4% decrease in the odds of prescription drug mismanagement. Controlling other socioeconomic indicators as well as health status and medication profile indicators, the odds of prescription medication mismanagement are increased to 1.84 among African American respondent compared to Whites. Other findings in the third column of  Table 3  suggest that as acute care physician visits increase by 1, mismanagement of medications increases by 1.2 times. The effect of mental health remains largely unchanged with the addition of the medication profile indicators.Underscoring the importance of the cost of medications for older adults' compliance with prescribed dosing regimens, a one-unit increase in difficulty paying for prescription medications increases the odds of mismanagement about 2.5 times. An increase of one unit in the measure of knowledge of what medications are for also results in a 3% decrease in prescription drug mismanagement. This third phase of model development provides a reasonable prediction of drug mismanagement, with roughly 33% of the variation in mismanagement explained.In sum, the third column of odds ratios provides a profile of older persons who are more likely than others to mismanage prescription medications in ways that are detrimental to their treatment effectiveness. These persons are older adults who are African American, younger, with more visits to physicians for acute health problems, poorer self-rated mental health, less knowledge of what drugs are for, and with more difficulty paying for medication, including spend-down requirements for Medicaid eligibility. Discussion Although concerned health care providers and policy makers advocate that a prescription medication benefit be added to Medicare coverage, congressional debates must consider the overall cost of such a benefit for the program as a whole. A preliminary estimate for President Clinton's 1999 prescription drug benefit proposal, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, estimated that net Medicare outlays would increase by $136 billion between 2002 and 2009 (Christensen and Wagner 2000   ). Such estimates, however, are highly uncertain and do not consider the possible effect that a more comprehensive benefit might have on driving up prices for some drugs.While some have suggested that any drug benefit must be tied to financial need in order to hold down overall program costs, relatively little is known about the characteristics of older adults impacted by this problem. Without such data, it is difficult to formulate meaningful policies that inform which segments of the population should receive such a benefit. In this article, we describe the extent to which prescription medication costs are a problem in a largely rural, noninstitutionalized population of older adults, and we describe a method to assess the impact of medication costs on adherence to prescribed medication regimens.Findings not shown in the tables indicate that more than half (about 56%) of 499 older adults using one or more prescription medications report no difficulty paying for their medications or paying the annual deductible required for the Medicaid prescription drug benefit ($250 deductible and a four-drug benefit in the study region). In contrast, 149 of 499 respondents (about 30%) said they have a little or some difficulty paying for their medications. Most importantly, 68 (about 14%) of the prescription medication users interviewed reported a great deal of difficulty paying for their prescription medications. Findings from the multiple logistic regression analysis, moreover, demonstrate that older adults who report more difficulty paying for prescription medications are significantly more likely than others to mismanage medications, reducing compliance with medication regimens that can ultimately result in adverse health effects.Additional analysis not shown also suggests that those reporting either some or a great deal of difficulty paying for their medications are more likely to be African American than White (χ2 = 29.8, p < .0000, Cramer's V = .24) and they are more likely to live in a rural compared to nonrural area (χ2 = 19.74, p < .002, Cramer's V = .20). Thus, it would seem prudent to consider targeting African American as well as rural elderly residents, in particular, in efforts to promote a prescription drug benefit.The findings from this study, therefore, provide preliminary support for the idea of means testing a Medicare prescription drug benefit with targeted intervention. Our data suggest that such a benefit would be of assistance to about 30% of the population studied and of significant importance to the poorest 14% of the sample. Alternatively, 56% of those surveyed reported little difficulty paying for prescription medications and would not immediately benefit from such coverage. Of course, circumstances change and many of those presently able to afford medication might not be if their health profiles worsened or if their financial status changed. Nonetheless, these data suggest that financial assistance for medications should be targeted to reach those most in need of such a benefit—a policy that would also help to contain the overall costs of such a program.Although well over half of the population surveyed reported little difficulty paying for prescription medications, we still found the mismanagement of prescription medications to be quite widespread (see  Table 1  ). Forty-four percent of the older adults interviewed who were taking at least one prescription medication used one or more mismanagement strategies. Almost one fifth of the respondents used three or more strategies. These findings suggest that difficulty paying for medication is not the only factor prompting people to mismanage medications. To explore this issue further, we assessed the effects of characteristics of older adults hypothesized to influence mismanagement, including socioeconomic, health status, and medication profile variables.Multiple logistic regression results suggest that older adults who are African American, as well as those who are younger in the group aged 66 and over, are more likely than others to mismanage medications. Although the population includes older adults with a wide income range, we found that neither categorical household income nor income adequacy had an effect on mismanagement. One could speculate that this is because controlling race in the analysis accounts for the effects of income and income adequacy. When income and income adequacy are eliminated in the analysis, however, the effects of race and age remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that prescription medication mismanagement is indeed more likely to occur among older people who are African American and younger elderly people regardless of income.Other studies also document the tendency of African Americans to use fewer prescription medications than White Americans (Fillenbaum et al. 1993   ; Khandker and Simoni-Wastila 1998   ; Kotzan, Carroll, and Kotzan 1989   ) although the reasons for this disparity are not well understood. Fillenbaum and associates 1993    study of a sample of community-residing elders found that health status and use of medical services were the most important predictors of prescription drug use for both African Americans and Whites. Thus, drug use may be lower among African Americans because they are less likely to use health services overall. Bazargan and coworkers 1993    found that the failure to fill prescriptions was greater among the African American elders who consumed more over-the-counter medications, suggesting that they might be resorting to self-treatment as a substitute for medical care. Our data, however, indicate that—with the exception of poor mental health—overall health status, which included an assessment of physician visits, did not affect prescription drug use. Previous research by two of this study's authors (Mitchell and Mathews 1992   ) would suggest, moreover, that some rural African American elders choose to rely on self-care and the use of alternative medications such as herbs and religious healing instead of biomedical services. In other words, noncompliance with prescription medication regimens, particularly in rural communities with strong alternative healing traditions, may be the result of preferential choice of resources as much as it is due to lack of access to care.It is important to note, however, that Fillenbaum and colleagues 1993    study did document an additional finding of importance related to finances. The authors found that having Medigap insurance for Whites and being on Medicaid for African Americans were factors predicting prescription drug use. The implication of their finding is that many African Americans may earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford Medigap or other supplemental insurance to pay drug costs not covered by Medicare, thus leading them to resort more to medication management strategies to control expenses. Indeed, a recent study of Medicare beneficiaries by Poisal and Chulis 2000    found that those enrollees without drug insurance consistently used fewer prescriptions, spent more out of pocket, and had less in total drug expenditures than their insured peers.These two factors (health status and insurance coverage) might also account for the somewhat puzzling finding that younger elders are more likely than older elders across both racial groups to mismanage medications. Again, the younger elderly group may have better overall health status and thus tend to use health services less frequently or to perceive less need for supplemental insurance to cover drug costs. Alternatively, those younger elders at the start of a chronic illness trajectory may have more financial resources available than the older group and may not yet have met the spend-down requirements necessary to qualify for Medicaid. Either of these factors could lead these younger elders to mismanage medications.The multiple logistic regression analysis also found those reporting poorer mental health to be more likely than others to mismanage medications. Elderly people in poorer mental health with multiple prescriptions may find it difficult to remember the physician's instructions for each medication. Forgetfulness has also been cited as a factor in the failure to have prescriptions filled initially (Bazargan et al. 1993   ). Alternatively, poor mental health may reflect cognitive impairment and an inability or unwillingness to comply with medical regimens as prescribed. A large community-based study by Hanlon and colleagues 1996    determined that elderly participants with cognitive impairment were less likely than cognitively intact subjects to use any prescription medications, and the authors concluded that drug use patterns by elderly people vary with cognitive status. More research needs to be done, however, to determine the extent to which cognitive impairment and/or the presence of specific mental disorders leads to the use of specific self-management strategies and whether such noncompliance with medication regimens is intentional or unintentional.As hypothesized, those with more acute-care physician visits are 1.2 times more likely than their counterparts to mismanage their medications. On the surface, this finding would seem to contradict a widespread observation in the literature that the cost burden for prescription medication is greatest for elderly people with chronic diseases (Mueller et al. 1997   ; Steinberg et al. 2000   ). It has been well documented that among the elderly population, 36% have three or more chronic conditions and account for 57% of drug expenditures for this group (Mueller et al. 1997   ). Given the statistical controls in our analysis, our finding suggests that for older adults already suffering from chronic disease, the experience of acute illness episodes may exacerbate problems paying for prescription medications, resulting in higher probability that drug mismanagement will occur.Finally, our study demonstrates that the number of medications currently taken, the retail cost of the medications, and the cost to the patient had no effect on mismanagement. This finding may be an artifact of the similar pattern that results when an older adult takes several lower cost medications or a few expensive ones. It is also possible that the cost of medication can potentially affect older adults across the income spectrum, with lower cost medication being a problem for persons with lower income and higher cost medications being problematic for persons with higher incomes. Alternatively, statistically controlling race and residence, our findings suggest that the national problem of prescription drug affordability is another example of a pervasive pattern in health inequality characterized by poorer access among rural African American older adults. They likely have more trouble paying for drugs or meeting the requirements of Medicaid spend-down, and they are probably more likely to deviate from prescribed drug dosage regimens after obtaining the medications. Limitations of the Study We recognize that the work described here has limitations. For example, we did not include the role of informal caregivers who help older adults manage their prescription medication regimens. We also recognize measurement shortcomings, such as our inability to assess the quality of consultation with physicians or pharmacists about dosing regimens. We also recognize that acute episodes resulting in physician visits could result from improperly taking medications as well as the reverse. The cross-sectional design impedes our ability to clarify the time ordering of these events. Finally, a number of factors need further exploration, including the relationship of poor mental health to cognitive impairment, the relationship of health status to health services utilization, and the relationship of age and race to the need for and the ability to purchase supplemental Medicare insurance or other private insurance and to the use of alternative health care resources. Implications of the Study Nonetheless, this research provides important empirical data on the degree to which prescription medication costs are a burden for a randomly selected population of noninstitutionalized elderly adults. The findings suggest that any revision of Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit should explore targeting that benefit to those with the greatest need. These data also demonstrate clearly that the mismanagement of medications is not solely the result of the inability to pay for prescription drugs. Rather, African Americans and the younger elderly population, those with poor mental health, those with less knowledge about the purpose of their medications, and those with more acute-care episodes are also more likely to mismanage medications. These observations are important because they demonstrate that the addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare will not completely solve the problem of medication noncompliance among elderly people. Additional measures will be necessary, including (a) assistance to those with poor mental health, and (b) special attention to the drug load prescribed for those elderly persons with multiple acute-care episodes, especially if they also suffer from additional chronic conditions. Finally, these data suggest that the gap in the care received between African Americans and Whites is not due solely to socioeconomic factors. Any interventions targeted toward improving compliance with medication regimens must be tailored to the particular needs and concerns of different ethnic groups.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The prevalence of depressive symptoms in elderly adults is high, yet the criteria to identify clinically significant depression may leave many elders undiagnosed and untreated. We explored the demographic and risk factor profiles of two groups, one with more severe depression and one with less severe depression. Design and Methods: The data come from the Duke University Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) baseline survey of 4,162 community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older. Results: The prevalence of depression meeting criteria of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES–D) and sub-threshold depression was 9.1% and 9.9%, respectively. In ordinal logistic regression, both CES–D and subthreshold depression were associated with impairment in physical functioning, disability days, poorer self-rated health, use of psychotropic medications, perceived low social support, female gender, and being unmarried. Implications:Depression appears to exist along a continuum, with demographic and social and physical health predictors of subthreshold depression similar to predictors of depression as defined by the CES–D scale.   Aging ,  Depressive symptoms ,  Epidemiology Laurence G. Branch, PhDMuch research over the last decade has focused on residual cases of depression that do not meet criteria according to the nomenclature, but are potentially clinically significant. Wells and colleagues 1989    reported that many patients seen in primary care had depressive symptoms but failed to meet the criteria for major depression or dysthymia. Yet, these patients exhibited a decreased quality of life and more dysfunction and disability than did patients with either hypertension or diabetes. Similarly, Broadhead, Blazer, George, and Tse 1990    reported that individuals in the community with minor depression had 51% more disability days than persons with major depression. The number of days lost from work among those with minor depression was similar to that reported by individuals with major depression. Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman 1992    reported that depressive symptoms were associated with as much service utilization and social morbidity as clinical depression. Philipp and colleagues 1992    applied several existing criteria to a sample of both psychiatric inpatients and outpatients and found the definition for depression too restrictive. Relaxing the time criteria and reducing the necessary symptom count to introduce a category of minor depression reduced the number of Depression Not Otherwise Specified cases by 80%.Minor depression was classified in the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC; Spitzer, Endicott, and Robins 1978   ), but it did not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; American Psychiatric Association 1980   ) criteria until reintroduced in the appendix to DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994   ). The lifetime prevalence of minor depression reported from the National Comorbidity Study using an approximation of the DSM criteria for minor depression was 10% (Kessler, Zhao, Blazer, and Swartz 1997   ). Judd, Rapaport, Paulus, and Brown 1994    reported that the one-year prevalence of subsyndromal depression (defined as depressive symptomatology not meeting the criteria for major or minor depression or dysthymia) in adults 18 or older in the landmark Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) data was 11.8%, higher than that for all diagnosed DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980   ) mood disorders combined. While this phenomenon has been referred to by different names including subthreshold, subclinical, minor, mild, and subsyndromal depression, a summary of the research to date concludes that, regardless of label, depressive symptoms not meeting diagnostic criteria are prevalent and associated with morbidity and functional impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen 1999   ). The specific criteria applied to capture these subthreshold symptoms have uniformly identified persons who do not meet traditional criteria, yet experience dysfunction secondary to depressive symptoms.The issue of subthreshold depression is particularly relevant for elderly people. As older age often brings a decline in physical health and functioning, decreases in cognitive functioning, bereavement, loss of independence, reduced income and role loss through retirement, and other factors associated with depression, one would assume the prevalence of depression to be high among older adults. In a sample of community-dwelling elders, the prevalence of significant dysphoric symptomatology was 14.7%, whereas the prevalence of major depression was much lower, 3.7% (Blazer and Williams 1980   ). In the ECA study, the prevalence of DSM-III-defined major depressive disorder among those 65 or older was 1.0% compared to 2.3% in those aged 45–64 and 3.4% in those aged 18–44 (Robins and Regier 1991   ). These findings have led to suggestions that the current diagnostic criteria for depression may be less applicable to elders and need to be broadened to include depression as seen in older adults (Blazer 1994   ; Ernst and Angst 1995   ). Lyness, King, Cox, Yoediono, and Caine 1999    recently reported that subsyndromal depression in older primary care patients was more prevalent than major depression, minor depression, and dysthymia, and was associated with functional disability and medical comorbidity similar to that seen in major or minor depression.The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) of community-dwelling adults aged 55–85 reported a one-month prevalence of minor depression of 12.9% (Beekman, Deeg, Van Tilberg, et al. 1995   ). Data from the LASA have shown that chronic physical illness, perceived poorer health, functional limitation, and lower scores on cognitive functioning tests are associated with minor depression. The LASA investigators defined minor depression as a score of 16 or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES–D; Radloff 1977   ) but not meeting DSM-III criteria (American Psychiatric Association 1980   ) for major depression.The objective of these analyses was to broaden the definition of subthreshold or minor depression and to examine the prevalence and correlates of subthreshold depression in a sample of community-dwelling elders. We hypothesized that: (1) The prevalence of subthreshold depression in older adults would be higher than that of CES–D-defined depression; (2) Subthreshold depression would be more prevalent in women, and the prevalence in both genders would increase with age; and (3) The symptom patterns and associations with demographic and social and physical health correlates observed in elders with subthreshold depression would be similar to those observed in individuals with CES–D-defined depression. Methods Sample Design. The data were obtained from the Duke University Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). This longitudinal study of community-dwelling elders aged 65 or older was sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and conducted at four sites—East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington Counties, Iowa; New Haven, Connecticut; and the Piedmont area of North Carolina. The data used in these analyses are from the baseline survey conducted in North Carolina 1986–87. The study design has been documented elsewhere (Blazer, Burchett, Service, and George 1991   ). Briefly, the sample is a stratified multistage area probability sample in which African Americans were oversampled. A total of 4,000 interviews were completed with sample members and an additional 162 interviews were completed with proxy informants, for an overall baseline survey response rate of 80%. The baseline survey data were collected through in-person interviews. Written consent was obtained, and all data collection and processing were conducted according to a prescribed protocol that had been approved by the institutional review boards at participating institutions. Only sample members who participated themselves are included in these analyses because depression questions were not asked of proxy informants. Subthreshold Depression and CES–D Depression. The EPESE measured depressive symptomatology using the CES–D scale (Radloff 1977   ). The CES–D is a 20-item scale that asks the respondent to indicate to what extent he or she had a particular feeling the previous week. A modified version was used at the Duke EPESE site, where respondents were asked to indicate whether or not the feeling had been present the previous week. In its original form, the CES–D has a range of scores from 0 to 60 with a score of 16 or greater considered depressed. Beekman, Deeg, Van Limbeek, et al. 1997    studied the validity of the CES–D in an elderly community-based sample. Using the one-month prevalence of major depression derived from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Robins, Helzer, Croughan, and Radcliff 1981   ) as criterion, the CES–D had a positive predictive value of 13.2%. Although the majority of those depressed according to the CES–D did not fulfill the DSM-III criteria for major depression, the authors concluded the validity of the CES–D was satisfactory in their sample of older adults.As described elsewhere (Blazer et al. 1991   ), a score of 9 or more symptoms on the modified scale used in the Duke EPESE was determined to be comparable to a score of 16 or greater on the original scale. In  Fig. 1  we present the cumulative frequency by gender of CES–D-defined depressive symptoms observed in our sample. As expected, men were more likely to have fewer symptoms than women. However, as indicated by the smooth curves, no clearly defined cutpoints for CES–D-scale depression or subthreshold depression were observed for either gender. For purposes of these analyses, subthreshold depression was then arbitrarily defined as a score of 6 to 8 depressive symptoms on the modified scale to lower the threshold from the usual cutpoint for CES–D-scale depression. Sample members with fewer than six symptoms were classified as nondepressed. The categories are therefore mutually exclusive. Sociodemographic Variables. We computed age from the sample member's self-reported date of birth and date of interview. The range of ages was 65–105 at baseline, and we used age as a continuous variable in the regression model. Race/ethnicity was determined by self-report, and we classified subjects as African American or White/Other. Less than 1% of the sample members was neither White nor African American and was classified as Other. Years of education ranged from 0 to 17 years. We used a dichotomous variable for the bivariate analyses, having completed 11 or more years or fewer than 11 years. For many older members- of this cohort, only 11 years were required to receive a high school diploma. Education was used as a continuous variable in the regression model. Finally, we classified subjects as currently married (regardless of whether currently living with spouse) or not married (never married, widowed, separated, or divorced). Physical Functioning and Disability. Self-perceived health was classified as excellent, good, fair, or poor. The four-level variable was modeled as a continuous variable in the multivariable analysis, with "excellent" as the reference group. To measure chronic disease, we used a measure of health status (Fillenbaum, Leiss, Pieper, and Cohen 1998   ) that summed all chronic conditions present from those listed (heart problems, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and cancer), with each condition weighted according to the estimated impact on overall health status. For the bivariate analyses, we used a dichotomous variable created from the full sample comparing the upper 35% to the lower 65%. For the regression analyses, we used the continuous variable with a range of 0 to 206, with 0 being no chronic disease. We used number of doctor visits as a continuous variable in the regression model, with a range of 0 to 100 visits. We measured self-reported disability and physical limitations in two ways. First, we asked, "During the past 3 months did you ever have to cut down on things you usually do because of illness or injury (not counting days in bed)?" to capture disability days. We also used a summary measure incorporating the seven activities of daily living (ADL) tasks identified by Katz, Downs, Cash, and Grotz 1970   , three of the six items reported by Rosow and Breslau 1966   , and the seven items from the instrumental ADL scale used in the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) survey (Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ). Subjects having difficulty or needing help with two or more activities were classified in the bivariate analyses as having some limitations in physical functioning. We used the continuous variable with a range of 0 to 13 in the regression model, with 0 indicating no difficulty. The summary measure was an attempt to capture an overall rating of physical functioning. Cognitive Functioning. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ; Pfeiffer 1975   ). We compared sample members with three or more errors to those with less than three, consistent with the cutpoint used by Pfeiffer to indicate mild to moderate impairment. Items marked "Can't do" or "Refused" were counted as errors. We had very few persons with six or more errors, most likely because the SPMSQ was used as a screening tool in the EPESE. Individuals with many errors participated by proxy because of cognitive reasons; they were not included in these analyses because depression was not ascertained through proxy respondents. These scores were not adjusted for race and education as done by Pfeiffer, because these demographic variables were included in the final regression model. Use of Psychotropic Medications. The coding of the medication data has been described elsewhere (Hanlon et al. 1992   ). The field interviewer obtained detailed information concerning prescription medications taken within the past 2 weeks or prescribed to be taken as needed. In these analyses, psychotropic medications included antidepressants, sedatives, hypnotics, and antianxiety and antipsychotic medications. Perceived Social Support. The Duke EPESE included multiple measures of social support. Previous research has shown that, although social support is multidimensional, perceived social support is significantly associated with adverse health outcomes (e.g., Blazer 1982   ). We used two questionnaire items to measure perceived social support, specifically, the degree to which a respondent feels he or she has someone to turn to if needed. The items were: "In times of trouble, can you count on at least some of your family or friends most of the time, some of the time, or hardly ever?" and "Can you talk about your deepest problems with at least some of your family or friends most of the time, some of the time, or hardly ever?" The responses to these items were summed, with a resulting range of 2 to 6. We classified a score of less than 5 as impaired for the bivariate analyses because the majority of the sample had a score of 6, and used the continuous measure for the regression with 2 being the reference group. Data Analysis. Weighted data were used for all analyses as well as for significance testing. The use of weights adjusted for the unequal probabilities of selection for each sample member. All analyses were first run using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (SAS Institute 1990   ) with a weight statement attached. The sample weights were downweighted to the original sample size for the purpose of significance testing in the initial analyses. The analyses were then run using SUrvey DAta ANalysis (SUDAAN) software (Research Triangle Institute 1997   ) to adjust for the clustering effect in the sample design.We first conducted general descriptive analyses and looked at the bivariate associations between selected factors and each of the levels of depression. To simultaneously control for the effects of various factors, we employed ordinal logistic regression with a three-level depression variable as the outcome and the social and physical health variables as independent predictors of depression status. Depression data were available for 3,996 of the 4,000 participants. Data from 3,674 of these sample members were complete for all independent variables. Nearly all of the predictors had at least some missing values, but those with the most missing data were physician visits (4%) and limitations in physical functioning (2%). Persons with missing data on one or more of the variables used in the logistic regression analyses were removed from all analyses. Results  Table 1  shows the prevalence of depression. A total of 9.1% of the 3,996 sample members with depression data had scores of 9 or greater on the modified CES–D scale, and 9.9% had scores of 6 to 8 symptoms, indicating subthreshold depression. The majority, 81%, reported experiencing five or fewer symptoms the week prior to the interview. As expected, the prevalence of both subthreshold depression and CES–D-scale depression was higher in women compared to men. Across both genders, there was a clear gradient of increased prevalence with age for both types of depression. Among those subjects with complete data on all control variables (n = 3,674), the prevalence of CES–D-scale depression was 8.4%, and the prevalence of subthreshold depression was 9.3%.In  Table 2  we present the responses to each of the 20 depression items for nondepressed individuals, those with subthreshold depression, and those with CES–D-defined depression. The proportion of sample members with subthreshold depression reporting each symptom was lower than the proportion of those with CES–D-defined depression, but all symptoms were represented. These data suggest that persons with subthreshold depression have a similar symptom complex to those with CES–D-defined depression, but fewer symptoms overall. We also ranked the items by the proportion of respondents reporting that symptom, and the rankings are very similar among those with subthreshold or CES–D-criteria depression (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.93). The four most common symptoms reported by both those with subthreshold and CES–D-scale depression were Item 6 (felt depressed), Item 18 (felt sad), Item 14 (felt lonely), and Item 7 (felt everything I did was an effort). By contrast, Item 6 (felt depressed) was the seventh most frequently reported symptom in the nondepressed group, and Item 18 (felt sad) was the fifth most frequently reported. We observed some differences in the particular symptoms reported comparing men to women, but within each gender, we found similar rankings of symptoms among those with CES–D or subthreshold depression compared to the nondepressed. Table 3  presents the characteristics of the sample and provides comparisons of these characteristics across depression status. Consistently, the proportion with a particular risk factor was highest among those with CES–D or subthreshold depression and lowest among the nondepressed. For example, although 62% of the overall sample were women, 73% of those with CES–D-scale depression and 67% of those with subthreshold depression were women. The same pattern was observed comparing those 75 or older to those 65–74 years of age. Overall, 35% of the sample was aged 75 or older, but among those with CES–D-scale depression and subthreshold depression, the proportion was higher, 42%. Differences were very pronounced for physical limitations. Overall, 30% had some difficulties with physical functioning. The proportion with difficulty among the nondepressed was only 24%, compared to 50% of those with subthreshold depression and 62% of those with CES–D-scale depression. Other measures of health status showed the same gradients in proportions in these uncontrolled analyses. Note that the means for these items increase as the number of depressive symptoms increase. These bivariate analyses show similar patterns of associations among those with subthreshold and CES–D-defined depression compared to the nondepressed. Table 4  presents these data in the form of crude prevalence odds ratios, comparing those with subthreshold depression or CES–D-scale depression to the nondepressed. With the exception of the association between race/ethnicity and CES–D-defined depression, each of the odds ratios was significant.The associations of the factors with the three levels of depression were then tested through ordinal logistic regression so the covariates could be simultaneously controlled to measure independent effects. The test for the proportional odds assumption was used to determine whether the constant proportionality assumption was valid for the odds for the two levels of depression with respect to their associated risk factors. The test was run on the full model that included the independent variables of interest and the three-level dependent variable. The chi square with 18 degrees of freedom was not significant (p = .27), allowing an ordinal model with parallel slopes but separate intercepts to be fitted to the data.To be sure the model assumptions of linearity were not violated, each of the continuous variables to be used in the model was tested individually in the full model. Specifically, each continuous variable was included along with higher order terms up to the fifth power. We used the log likelihood ratio test to see if the additional higher order terms as a group were significant. The only two variables with significant nonlinear relationships with depression were number of doctor visits and number of limitations in physical functioning. By progressively dropping out the highest order terms, we found physical functioning was only significant to the second power. We plotted the summary of the odds of the continuous variable and its squared term and found the odds of depression increased as the number of limitations increased to an approximate score of 7 and then began to decrease. To adjust for this nonlinear relationship, we included the squared term in the final model. The number of doctor visits was significant for the highest order term. Again, we plotted the summary of these odds and found the odds of depression increased as the number of doctor visits increased to an approximate value of 16 and then decreased to a value of 51, increased again to 62, and then decreased. To accommodate this nonlinear relationship, we included the four higher order terms in the model.Finally, we assessed the model for collinearity between the independent variables and found that the social and physical health variables were relatively independent. Self-rated health had the lowest tolerance (0.69). Interaction terms between both age and gender and each of the social and physical health correlates were not significant.The resulting odds ratio for the association between each of the independent variables and depression in our final logistic model compares the change in the relative odds for being in a more depressed group (CES–D-defined depression and subthreshold depression vs nondepressed and CES–D-scale depression vs subthreshold depression and nondepressed) for a one-unit change in the factor of interest. The associations of the sociodemographic variables of age, race/ethnicity, and education with depression were not significant ( Table 5  ). Multiplying the beta coefficient for age, 0.0031, by 10 and exponentiating the result, we found the odds of being in a more depressed group are 1.03 for each decade-increase in age. Gender (p < .05) and marital status (p < .01) were associated with depression. The odds of a higher level of depression were 1.28 in women compared to men and 1.50 in unmarried men and women compared to married. Chronic health problems were not significantly associated with a higher depression group. The association between the number of doctor visits and depression group depends on the number of visits.The associations between measures of physical health and disability, including limitations in physical functioning, self-perceived health, and disability days (having to cut down on usual activities) were all highly significant in controlled analyses. Again, because the relationship between physical functioning and depression is not linear, the odds ratio cannot be directly interpreted, but depends on the particular value on the scale. It is important to note that because items from different scales were summed, the measuring of a unit change is not necessarily constant. The reference group for self-perceived health was those individuals who said their health was excellent. Therefore, compared to excellent health, the odds of being in a depressed group for those who said their health was good were higher, at 1.77. The odds of belonging to a more depressed group in those who perceive their health as fair were 3.13, and in those who perceive their health as poor, 5.55.Impaired perceived social support and psychotropic medication use were also significantly associated with depression group (p < .001), whereas the association between cognitive impairment and depression group was not significant. The reference group for perceived social support was those with a score of 2 on the scale. The odds of belonging to a group with higher depression scores decreased as perceived social support increased. That is, perceived social support is protective. For example, relative to the lowest support group, the odds of belonging to a more depressed group were 0.67 for those with a value of 3 and 0.21 for those with a value of 6, the highest value on our scale. Finally, the odds of being in a more depressed group were 1.93 in those using psychotropic medication in the last week compared to nonusers. Discussion These findings show that depressive symptoms not meeting the CES–D threshold are very prevalent in older adults. Overall, 19% of the sample had six or more depressive symptoms in the week prior to the interview. In these data, the prevalence of subthreshold depression (which we operationally defined as 6–8 symptoms) was higher than the prevalence of CES–D-criteria depression. Results from the ordinal logistic regression suggest depression in these elders appears to exist along a continuum, with individuals with subthreshold depression similar to those with CES–D-criteria depression in terms of demographics and social and physical health correlates. These results are particularly important in showing that, among community-dwelling elders, depressive symptomatology below the threshold for the CES–D is also significantly associated with poorer self-rated health, disability days in the past 3 months, limitations in physical functioning, psychotropic medication use, and perceived low social support. Our proportional odds test indicates that a parallel model is appropriate for these data. That is, it is appropriate to force the odds to be constant across the two categories of depression.In the controlled analyses, age was not significantly related to either level of depression, suggesting that perhaps much of the relationship between age and depression is indirect through some other variable(s) such as physical functioning. Female gender was associated with depression, whereas race/ethnicity and level of education were not. Our finding that depressive symptoms were associated with functional limitations and disability days was consistent with previous research (Beekman, Deeg, Van Tilberg, et al. 1995   ; Beekman, Deeg, Braam, Smit, and Van Tilberg 1997   ; Blazer and Williams 1980   ; Broadhead et al. 1990   ; Maier, Gansicke, and Weiffenbach 1997   ; Wells et al. 1989   ). Because this is a cross-sectional analysis, whether depression leads to a decrease in physical functioning as a result of decreased activity or whether decreased functioning leads to depression is unclear and will be the subject of future investigation. In controlled analyses, depression group was not associated with chronic disease, but was correlated with self-rated health, consistent with the findings of Beekman, Kriegsman, Deeg, and Van Tilberg 1995    that the more subjective aspects of illness were more strongly associated with depression than disease categories.Depression group was not independently associated with cognitive functioning in controlled analyses, a finding in contrast to previous work (Beekman, Deeg, Van Tilberg, et al. 1995   ; Fichter, Bruce, Schroppel, Meller, and Merikangas 1995   ). This finding may be due, in part, to our excluding from the analyses those with more severe cognitive impairment. Although an association between impaired social support and depression in elders has been documented (Blazer 1983   ), the association with sub-threshold depression is less known. Our finding that being unmarried and having impaired perceived social support were associated with depression is consistent with that of Beekman, Deeg, Van Tilberg, and colleagues (1995), who found that minor depression was associated with smaller network size, less instrumental support given, and more emotional support received. Finally, our finding that psychotropic medication use was correlated with subthreshold depression is consistent with the findings of Lyness and colleagues 1999   , who reported that in a sample of primary care patients, the proportion of subjects with subsyndromal depression taking an antidepressant (38.5%) was comparable to the proportion of major depressives (47.8%) and minor depressives (46.2%) taking an antidepressant.The CES–D scale (Radloff 1977   ) was developed for use in community studies; it was not designed to elicit clinical diagnoses, but to screen for clinically significant depressive symptoms. Most of the validity literature has assessed the validity of the CES–D-scale to capture clinically significant depression. For example, Lyness and colleagues 1997    have suggested that the cutpoint should be raised to 21 to capture only clinically significant depression. As Beekman, Deeg, Van Limbeek, and associates (1997) note, the positive predictive value of the CES–D scale is low. That is, many individuals identified as depressed do not meet DSM criteria for major depression. Yet, Beekman, Deeg, Van Tilberg, and colleagues (1995) found that those with CES–D-criteria depression not meeting DSM criteria had a similar risk factor profile to those with DSM major depression. In other words, the ability of the CES–D scale to validate a diagnosis of major depression does not capture the strength of the CES–D scale to identify community-dwelling elders with clinically significant depression. Therefore, the validity of the CES–D with DSM criteria is less relevant here, as we are interested in depressive symptomatology. In fact, most of the literature regarding subthreshold depression is not so much concerned with establishing whether such an entity exists, but rather exploring the public health burden of depressive symptoms that do not meet typical diagnostic or screening criteria. Rather than creating a new nosological category of depression, our intent was to ask: If the threshold were lowered for elders, would we see the risk factors and associations seen with more symptomatic depression? We found that depressive symptomatology below the threshold of the CES–D cutpoint was associated with impairments in functioning in older adults.As in the original CES–D, our cutpoint was decided arbitrarily in the absence of obvious breaks. Our hypothesis comparing the prevalence in the two groups, therefore, cannot be tested, but the finding of a large proportion of elders with depressive symptomatology below the current CES–D threshold can be noted. These results suggest that depression appears to exist along a continuum, with demographic and physical health predictors of subthreshold depression similar to predictors of CES–D-criteria depression.The sample was drawn from community-dwelling elders who may not be representative of older adults who go to physicians for treatment or reside in long-term care institutions. In particular, no depression data were available for sample members who participated by proxy (approximately 4% of the baseline sample). The CES–D scale does not measure duration of symptoms; therefore, DSM criteria for major or minor depression or dysthymia cannot be applied to these data. The depression data were obtained through self-report, which could be viewed as a limitation by clinicians. Nevertheless, self-report data are the norm for community-based studies.Research is needed to further characterize subthreshold depression in these older adults, particularly its course and relationship to a course of more symptomatic depression. Beekman, Deeg, Smit, and Van Tilberg 1995    reported that, after one year, 32% of subjects with minor depression relapsed, 25% remitted but relapsed later, and 43% were chronically depressed. Beekman, Deeg, VanTilberg, and colleagues (1995) also found that a history of major depression was associated with current minor depression, supporting the hypotheses that the subtypes are different manifestations of the same illness. Questions remain concerning the longitudinal course of subthreshold depression in older adults, particularly whether it predicts more symptomatic depression and whether the course is affected by treatment. We also plan to look at the depression continuum and test the threshold against an outcome such as mortality.Finally, these results have public health implications with regard to recognizing depression in older adults and preventing undertreatment. Clinicians and researchers should recognize that not only older individuals who do not meet DSM criteria for depression, but also those who fall below the threshold on instruments such as the CES–D, may experience symptoms of depression that deserve attention because of their potential to be associated with adverse health consequences.

     Abstract Purpose: The prevalence and correlates of paranoid ideation were investigated. Design and Methods: On the basis of a sample of 998 independently living elderly African American persons in a cross-sectional study, the study used the Brief Symptom Inventory to measure paranoid ideation and 14 independent variables, including demographic characteristics, cognitive deficit, depression, self-reported memory functioning, emotional and instrumental support, stressful life events, limitation of daily activities, self-rated health status, and self-rated hearing and vision. Results and Implications: Paranoid ideation (symptoms of paranoia) was found in 10% of this sample. A multiple regression analysis of the data revealed that of the 14 independent variables used in this study, 6 (income, instrumental support, hearing, stressful life events, self-reported memory deficit, and depression) showed a significant relationship with paranoid ideation.   Depression ,  Social support ,  Memory ,  Hearing impairment Vernon L. Greene, PhDThe limited available epidemiological studies of paranoid ideation among elderly people indicate a steady increase in symptoms among this segment of the population over the past three decades (Christenson and Blazer 1984   ; Blazer, Hays, and Salive 1996   ; Forsell and Henderson 1998   ; Lowenthal 1964   ). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., or DSM–IV: American Psychiatric Association 1994   ) makes only a limited reference to paranoia in elderly people. The terms paranoid ideation or paranoid symptom, as used in this article, refer to a distinct clinical entity: a suspicion or delusional disorder that is nonschizophrenic (Lewis 1970   ; Rabins 1992   ) and that is characterized by the tendency to view individuals or agencies with suspicion or as having harmful intentions. Studies suggest that only a small percentage of elderly persons suffering from paranoia are adequately diagnosed and treated (Forsell and Henderson 1998   ; Wykle, Segall, and Nagley 1992   ). This documented increase in symptoms, together with reports of lack of proper diagnosis and treatment of paranoid ideation among the rapidly growing elderly population, suggests the need for more careful examination of the problem.The literature that has been published on this topic has stressed the clinical importance of the following as high-risk or contributing factors for late-life paranoid symptoms: sensory deficits; social isolation; medical illness; cognitive impairment; confusion; the aging process; poor self-rated physical and mental health (Jette and Winnett 1987   ); poor education and economic status (Terrell and Barrett 1979   ); sense of deprivation and injustice (Fenigstein and Vanable 1992   ); sense of loss of control over the environment (Mirowsky and Ross 1983   ); and psychiatric symptoms, particularly depressive symptoms (Almeida, Howard, Levy, and David 1995   ; Blazer et al. 1996   ; Christenson and Blazer 1984   ; Eisdorfer 1980   ).It is now well established that the study of psychiatric disorders should be conducted in the context of both social and cultural perspectives (Fabrega, Mezzich, and Ulrich 1988   ; Strickland, Longobardi, and Gray 1999   ). In the current literature, both Fabrega and associates 1988    and Newhill 1990    have raised these issues, which are of primary importance to our study, namely the role of social and cultural background in addition to the individual psychopathology. These authors indicate the need to attend to sociocultural differences in the expression of paranoid symptomatology. For example, self-protective defensive behavior among African Americans may be perceived as paranoid symptomatology if the oppressive socioeconomic context is ignored (Newhill 1990   ).The purpose of this exploratory study was to expand understanding of paranoid symptomatology among urban, elderly African American persons using senior center facilities by examining the independent impact of demographics, social support, cognitive deficit, and health status self-ratings on health, vision, hearing, memory, and personal characteristics on paranoid symptoms. The study of paranoid ideation and its correlates may yield data that are useful in establishing treatment equity for this population (Bazargan and Hamm-Baugh 1995   ). Methods Sample Selection The study sample was composed of 1,114 elderly African Americans, ages 62 years and older, living independently in New Orleans, Louisiana. They were randomly selected from the service lists for 23 senior citizen centers in the city. The participants were notified by a personal letter describing the nature of the study and selection procedures for inclusion of participants. To encourage voluntary participation, each potential participant was offered remuneration. A few days after personal letters were mailed, selected participants were contacted by telephone and solicited for participation. For those selected whose telephone numbers were not listed (n = 70; 6%), we used door-to-door solicitation. During these solicitations, the study was once again described, and all questions regarding the research were answered. Appointments for survey interviews were made with all those who agreed to participate in this study. Face-to-face interviews were subsequently conducted in the homes of all consenting participants by trained African American interviewers at designated appointed times. The data were collected between February 1992 and July 1993. Only 12% of those selected declined to participate; the refusal rates for telephone and door-to-door solicitation were similar. Out of 1,114 interviews, a total of 998 were successfully completed. Measurement  Table 1  displays the means, standard deviations, and percentages of the variables used in this study to evaluate the factors associated with paranoid ideation among our sample of elderly African American persons. We used the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a 53-item self-reported symptom inventory (essentially the brief form of the revised Symptom Check List 90; Derogatis 1993   ) in the present study. The BSI was designed to reflect the psychological symptom patterns of psychiatric and medical patients as well as nonpatients (Derogatis 1993   ). Paranoid ideation and depression are among nine primary symptom dimensions that are measured by the BSI. The cardinal characteristics of projective thought, hostility, suspiciousness, grandiosity, centrality, fear of loss of autonomy, and delusions are viewed as primary aspects of paranoid ideation. The symptoms of the paranoid ideation dimension consist of the following beliefs:Others are to blame for most of your troubles.Most people cannot be trusted.You are watched or talked about by others.Others are not giving you proper credit for your achievements.People will take advantage of you if you let them.The internal consistency and test–retest reliability coefficients for the Paranoid Ideation scale have been reported as .77 and .91, respectively (Derogatis 1993   ). Each item of the BSI is rated on a 5-point scale of distress (0–4), ranging from not at all (0) at one pole to extremely (4) at the other. The alpha reliability of this composite indicator for our sample was .71.The symptoms of the depression dimension reflect a representative range of the indications of clinical depression, and this dimension is composed of a set of symptoms and signs that are associated clinically with high levels of manifest depression (Derogatis 1993   ). The internal consistency coefficient for the depression index has been reported as .85 (Derogatis 1993   ). The Cronbach's alpha for this index among our sample was .76.Cognitive impairment was measured by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein and McHugh 1975   ). The MMSE has been extensively tested for its ability to identify cognitive impairments accurately (Tombaugh, McIntyre, and McIntyre 1992   ). However, a few studies showed that participants' educational level influenced the results of the MMSE (Escobar and colleagues 1986   ; Murden, McRae, Kaner, and Bucknam 1991   ). The MMSE used in this study consisted of five cognitive domains or functions: orientation to time, orientation to place, registration of three words, attention (spelling world backward, and recall of three words. Following Morris, Mohs, and Rogers 1988   , we did not include the calculation function (the serial 7s), but used world as an alternative. The word world was spelled forward (or corrected) before spelling it backward.Self-reported memory deficits were evaluated by the 27-item Memory Functioning Questionnaire (Gilewski and Zelinski 1988   ; Zelinski and Gilewski 1988   ). The 27-item scale used in this study has four subscales: General Rating of Memory, Retrospective Functioning, Frequency of Forgetting, and Remembering Past Events. The internal consistency estimate (Cronbach's alpha) for the overall summated 27-item scale was very high (α = .93), and none of the correlation coefficients among the items was less than .40. The total score ranged from 28 to 100 (SD = 12.23), and higher scores on this index represent a more positive self-appraisal.Emotional and tangible social support was measured with a modified version of the inventory of social supportive behaviors (Barrera, Sandler, and Ramsay 1981   ; Krause 1986   ). Emotional support consisted of 11 items and was based on the personal qualities and behaviors of a support person, including empathy, caring, love, and trust. Instrumental support consisted of 9 items and was based on the instrumental behaviors performed by a helping person. The helping person intervenes by providing transportation, making a financial contribution, helping with work obligations, or providing some other form of material aid or direct relief (Krause 1986   ). A higher score on these indicators reflects greater emotional and tangible support. The reliabilities of the 11 and 9 items for emotional and instrumental support were .87 and .75, respectively.This study included a measure of negative stressful life events as one of the potential correlates of paranoid ideation. The measure of stressful life events used in this study is a revised version of the scale developed by Holmes and Rahe 1967    and consists of 16 items. The items used for this index are stressful life events that range from the death of a spouse or a child to being the victim of a crime. Each stressful life event was coded dichotomously, with yes coded as 1, and no coded as 0. Therefore, the total score can range from 0 to 16, and a higher score on the scale indicates more stressful life events.An index measuring self-reported health status was constructed, using three items: self-reported health rating, self-reported health status compared with 2 years ago, and self-reported health status compared with peers of the same age. Principal-components analysis of these three variables formed only one factor, and this factor was highly correlated with each of the variables (% of variance = 60.4; communality, .58 to .64).Self-reported vision was evaluated with the single question "How is your vision [if Respondent wears glasses] after you put your glasses on?" with response categories of 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, and 4 = poor. Similarly, self-reported hearing was evaluated with the single question "How is your hearing?" with response categories of 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, and 4 = poor.Limitation of daily activities was derived from 11 questions asking respondents to report how much their daily activities were limited by any given chronic illnesses (i.e., heart disease; hypertension; diabetes; arthritis; respiratory diseases; kidney, teeth and gum, and blood circulation problems; stroke; and cancer). Scores ranged from 0, not at all, to 3, a great deal. It is important to note that the limitation of daily activity scores are derived from the chronic condition questions, not the Activities of Daily Living index questions. This would probably underreport limitations in activities where the individual has limitations but does not attribute them to any of the 11 listed conditions. Age, sex, education, and monthly income are among selected demographic and socioeconomic status variables. Analysis Plan. In performing the multivariate analysis, we used two statistical techniques: multiple logistic regression and ordinary least square (OLS) regression. To do so, both dichotomous and continuous scores were created with the index of paranoid ideation. As mentioned in the measurement section, the five symptoms composing the paranoid ideation dimension were measured on a 5-point scale of distress (0–4), ranging from not at all (0) at one pole to extremely (4) at the other. The total score ranged from 0 to 17. The average of the index (total score divided by the number of items) ranged from 0 to 3.4 (M = 0.379; SD = 0.542), with the higher scores representing more paranoid ideation symptoms. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with this summated continuous raw score. Following procedures outlined by Lewis-Beck 1980   , we submitted all of the statistical assumptions of OLS regression analyses to testing. No harmful multicollinearity was detected. However, we acknowledge that the index of paranoid ideation (dependent variable) is skewed (skewness = 1.937; SE = .077). Therefore, one of the assumptions of OLS regression is violated. Because our sample size was large (N = 998), unbiased estimates of regression coefficients are expected. Nonetheless, as an added safeguard, we also estimated the model for the dichotomous measure, using logistic regression analyses. For the purpose of logistic regression analyses, a score of 1.2 for the index of paranoid ideation is considered a cut-off point. The cut-off point score is more than 1.5 units of standard deviation above the average. This cut-off point score is similar to the mean for paranoid ideation among a sample of 1,002 psychiatric outpatients (M = 1.12; SD = 0.95) from the BSI scales' validation study (Derogatis 1993   ). Results Characteristics of the Sample The mean age of the sample was 72.4 years; the range was 62 to 99 years. The sample consisted of 24% men and 79% women. Only 21% of the sample were currently married, 55% were widowed, and 25% were divorced, separated, or never married. The mean education was 8.7 years, and 49% of the participants indicated that they had no formal education beyond eighth grade. Slightly more than 24% reported completing high school. Seventy percent of the sample reported a monthly income of $750 or less ($9,000 per year). The average reported income was $680 per month ($8,160 per year).Similarly to our data, census information indicated that 61% of elderly African Americans living in New Orleans had a yearly income of $9,999 or less; 51% had less than a 9th-grade education; and 24% had completed high school or had post–high school education (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1990   ).With regard to self-reported health status, 8% rated their present health as excellent; 32% described their health as good, 42% as fair, and 18% as poor. A 1992 National Health Interview Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics 1995   ) found, in findings remarkably similar to our own, that 9.3% of African Americans ages 65 years and older reported their health status as excellent, compared with 17.6% who rated their health status as poor (N = 2,622).Of our study population, 7% indicated no chronic illness. The number of chronic illnesses reported by the remainder of the sample ranged from 1 to 11; the average number of conditions reported was just over 3 (M = 3.3). The most frequently cited chronic illnesses were arthritis (66%), hypertension (62%), eye problems (47%), heart trouble (33%), diabetes (24%), and circulation problems (24%). Almost 38% of participants reported that at least one condition greatly limited their daily activities. Of the respondents, 25% represented no limitation in their daily activities. The findings of the 1986 Functional Limitations Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey, which indicated that almost 29% of elderly African Americans reported no difficulty in their daily activities (Blesch and Furner 1993   ), are similar to our study.  Table 1  displays the means, percentages, standard deviations, ranges, and coding algorithms of all independent variables used in this study. Paranoid Ideation Our data classified 10% of elderly African American participants in this study as being above the cut-off point for having symptoms of paranoia.  Table 1  displays the means and standard deviations of the paranoid ideation index and the five symptoms comprising its dimension. The mean for the paranoid ideation index was .379 (SD = .542). This is identical to the nonpatient normative sample of 974 of the BSI scale validation study by Derogatis 1993   . Within our sample, 63% of the individuals with scores of 6 or more answered "quite a bit" or "extremely" to at least two symptoms of paranoid ideation. In addition, 86% of participants with scores of 6 or more answered "moderately," "quite a bit," or "extremely" to at least two symptoms of paranoid ideation. Bivariate Relationship The zero-order correlations among the index of paranoid ideation and each of the selected independent variables are displayed in  Table 2  . This table indicates that 7 of 14 independent variables were significantly related to paranoid ideation among our sample of elderly African American persons. They were depression (r = .47), self-reported memory function (r = −.23), number of stressful life events (r = .22), limitation of daily activities (r = .15), self-rated health status (r = .10), instrumental social support (r = −.08), and income (r = .08). To control for possible multicollinearity, we examined all correlations of the independent variables. A further inspection of  Table 2  indicates that the interrelations among the independent variables were modest, and no sign of harmful multicollinearity was detected. Of 105 bivariate correlation coefficients, only 4 were greater than .4 ( Table 2  ). These interrelationships were as follows: between education and cognitive deficit (r = −.40); between self-reported memory function and depression (r = −.40); between emotional support and instrumental support (r = .50); and the largest, between self-rated health index and Activity of Daily Living scale (r = .53). Multivariate Analysis  Table 3  contains the standardized multiple regression coefficients and standard error for predicting paranoid ideation, illustrating that with all independent variables in the equation, the adjusted R2 was .252, F(14, 978) = 24.75, p < .0001. Of 14 independent variables, 6 showed a significant relationship with paranoid ideation. Examination of the data revealed that of 7 independent variables that showed significant relationships in bivariate levels, all except 1 (limitation of daily activities) remained significant in multiple regression analysis. As was expected, depression (β = −.43) was among the predominant correlates of paranoid ideation. Stressful life events, self-rated memory index, instrumental support, income, and self-rated hearing were also significantly related to paranoid ideation. These results indicate that a higher level of paranoid ideation was found among those with (a) higher levels of depression, (b) higher numbers of negative stressful life events, (c) more self-reported memory problems, (d) lower levels of instrumental social support, (e) lower levels of income, and (f) more hearing problems. Limitation of daily activities, which initially showed a significant relationship with paranoid ideation in bivariate analysis, lost its significance in the multiple regression as a result of the variance shared with depression.We used a new model to test for the presence of interaction effects between the social support indices, depression scale, and stressful life events. Because this model included new product terms and in order to avoid multicollinearity between the independent variables (first-order terms) and the product terms, the independent variables were centered (put in deviation score form so their means were zero) and the product terms were formed by multiplying the centered independent variables of interest (Aiken and West 1991   ). No interaction effects were detected.The results of a multivariate logit analysis connecting paranoid ideation to the 14 independent variables reveals that, similar to the multiple regression analysis, the same 6 variables registered a significant independent impact on paranoid ideation (table not presented here).  Table 4  shows the predicted probability fluctuation (Hamilton 1990   ) of paranoid ideation for those 6 variables that were significant on the logit model. Fluctuation was calculated for two hypothetical respondents who were "perfectly average" in all relevant predictors except that one respondent was placed at the 10th percentile rank and the other was placed at the 90th percentile rank of each variable whose independent impact on paranoid ideation was under investigation. For example, we found that once all other relevant variables were held constant, elderly African American participants whose measured level of self-reported memory function index placed them in the 90th percentile were 7% less likely to be identified with paranoid ideation symptoms than those placed in the 10th percentile. The nature of the linkages between paranoid ideation and hearing impairment, income, stressful life events, instrumental support, and depression are also provided in  Table 4  . Discussion In this study, we provide the first published data assessing the prevalence and associations of paranoid symptoms in a selected community sample of elderly African Americans. The model measured paranoid ideation with the BSI and included 14 independent variables: demographic characteristics, cognitive impairment, depression, self-reported memory deficits, social support, stressful life events, limitation in daily activities, health status, and self-rated hearing and vision.Symptoms of paranoia were found in 10% of this sample. How does this compare with the general aged population? We know, for example, that in 1964 Lowenthal documented 2% paranoid ideation; 20 years later Christenson and Blazer 1984    reported 4% paranoid ideation symptoms in a community of elders; and 12 years later Blazer and associates 1996    reported that symptoms of paranoia were found in 9.5% of a community sample of elders. We do not know the historical trends for paranoid ideation among elderly African Americans. All we now know is that the rate we found (10%) is higher than that found in previous studies but appears comparable to the general aged population. Nevertheless, these data are alarming for African American populations. The alarm is raised because our results are derived from a sample drawn from persons in the community who might have been receiving greater social support from senior service facilities, a feature that might distinguish them from the general community of African American elderly persons. This would imply that rates in the general population of African American elderly persons may in fact be considerably higher than those in our sample. Regardless of this hypothesis, the rate of 10% points to an urgent emerging problem requiring further research.Examination of the data using both OLS and logistic regression revealed that 6 of the 14 independent variables used in this study showed a significant relationship with paranoid ideation. The results indicated that a higher level of paranoid ideation was found among individuals with higher levels of depression, greater numbers of negative stressful life events, more self-reported memory problems, lower levels of instrumental social support, lower levels of income, and more hearing problems. These overall results confirm the most recent Swedish study (Forsell and Henderson 1998   ), which reported that paranoia symptoms were found among individuals with higher levels of depression, lower levels of social support, and poorer physical health.Depression was identified as the strongest correlate of paranoid ideation symptoms among our sample of elderly African Americans. This finding was similar to data reported in previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using multivariate analysis. At first glance, the relationship between paranoid ideation and depression seems contradictory, as a classical observation in depressed people is attribution of negative events to self and attribution of positive events to circumstances or actions of others (Robbins and Hays 1995   ). However, the older adult is losing friends, resources, networks, income, and mobility. The struggle to replace what is being lost could perhaps lead to abnormal attention to and preferential recall of threat-related information (Bentall, Kaney, and Bowen-Jones 1995   ), or the depression may simply be associated with chronic illness due to aging or may be an appropriate response to a hostile environment (Blazer et al. 1996   ). The findings concerning depression are complex and suggest the need for more in-depth exploration through a longitudinal study.A second finding of significance was the correlation between lower levels of instrumental social support and paranoid ideation. Jette and Winnett 1987    argued that vulnerable individuals who are unable to respond effectively to the challenges of advancing age, owing to lack of personal and social resources, often feel increasingly isolated, helpless, and misunderstood and experience a lack of acknowledgment or confirmation. Over time, their sensitivity may increase to the point that they become suspicious of others' intentions toward them.Greater number of stressful life events was also a correlate of significance. These findings differ considerably from those of Blazer and associates 1996   , which documented no connection between negative life events and paranoid ideation. One explanation for this discrepancy might be the difference between Blazer and colleagues' predominantly rural setting (52%) as compared with our urban one. Our data suggest that elderly African Americans living in the inner city are influenced by excessive crime, frequent loss (death of spouse, friends, relatives), lack of access to proper medical care, and serious financial difficulties. Thus, they may engage in a defensive strategy against depression and the resulting self-negation. This struggle leads to what is so frequently referred to in the African American community as "healthy paranoia."There was notable association between self-reported memory problems and symptoms of paranoid ideation, even after other related variables, including depression and cognitive and sensory functioning, were held constant. Over 14% of this sample of aged African Americans reported that they had major problems with their memory functions. Moreover, 26% of participants described their memory function as worse than 1 year ago, and 13% of this sample said that they were very bad at remembering things that occurred last month. Among participants with symptoms of paranoid ideation, 24% reported that they had major problems with their memory functions; 38% described their memory function as worse than 1 year ago; and 19% said that they were very bad at remembering things that occurred last month. This relationship between subjective memory assessment and symptoms of paranoid ideation has significance in terms of broadening the role of primary care physicians in promoting mental health and quality of life among elderly persons.In the last finding of note, we detected an independent impact of hearing problems on symptoms of paranoid ideation, a finding consistent with the literature (Almeida et al. 1995   ), but no connection between self-reported vision impairment and symptoms of paranoid ideation. Several research findings have suggested that hearing impairments increase self-reported memory problems (Bazargan and Barbe 1994   ) and diminish cognitive capacity (Granik, Kleban, and Weiss 1976   ; Lindenberger and Baltes 1994   ; Marsiske, Delius, Lindenberger, Scherer, and Tesch-Romer 1996   ; Sands and Meredith 1989   ; Thomas et al. 1983   ). Together these may reinforce a preexisting tendency to social isolation, withdrawal, and suspiciousness (Almeida et al. 1995   ). Reports of a significant reduction of psychotic activity after the fitting of hearing aids indicates that hearing impairment is at least a predisposing factor to the development of paranoid symptoms (Almeida 1993   ; Eastwood, Corbin, and Reed 1981   ; Khan, Clark, and Oyebode 1988   ).This study suffered from three main limitations. First, interpretation of the findings is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study. For example, taking the paranoid symptoms as the independent variable, the impact of depression, self-reported memory problems, and other independent variables on symptoms of paranoid ideation were discussed. However, it is plausible that paranoid ideation induces depression. Similarly, the association of self-reported memory problems and paranoid ideation could reflect complaining behavior rather than a direct correlation between the two. Second, the data we generated are from a nonprobability sample, which limits our ability to generalize the findings. Elders who are involved with senior centers are a select group, and it is plausible that they are less suspicious than those not involved. Third, we used published BSI norms to document that this sample was identical to the nonpatient normative sample; however, these samples were not race matched.The strengths of this study include sample size, reliability of the instruments, and the analysis of recognized variables. The sample was a large one, representing a diverse community of urban elderly African Americans. We used several standard instruments with well-established reliability and validity to measure paranoid ideation, depression, memory deficit, cognitive deficit, social support, and other key concepts. Last, this study included most of the variables that have been previously identified as potential correlates of paranoid ideation.The occurrence of paranoid ideation in such a significant population should not be summarily dismissed as premorbid psychosis. Cultural contexts that promote feelings of alienation, powerlessness, and victimization are more likely to engender paranoid thinking, which may serve a self-protective function. It is this psychological self-protection that may be the link between paranoia and elderly persons in culturally oppressed groups (Whaley 1998   ). These findings suggest a need to critically examine and appropriately diagnose elderly African Americans' paranoid symptoms (Abedimpe 1981   ; Fabrega et al. 1988   ; Raskin, Crook, and Herman 1975   ) and to produce a greater volume of high-quality scientific data toward the provision of adequate and equal health care for this growing population.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined the decision-making capacity of persons with cognitive impairment with respect to their everyday care preferences and choices. This is the first in a series of articles to report on findings from a larger study that examines choice, decision making, values, preferences, and practices in everyday care for community-dwelling persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers. Design and Methods: Fifty-one respondent pairs, or dyads, were interviewed, that is, persons with cognitive impairment (n = 51) and their family caregivers (n = 51). All persons with cognitive impairment were interviewed twice within a week using a parallel interview to determine stability and accuracy of responses. The family caregiver was interviewed once. Results: Persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (i.e., Mini-Mental State Exam scores 13–26) are able to respond consistently to questions about preferences, choices, and their own involvement in decisions about daily living, and to provide accurate and reliable responses to questions about demographics. Implications: Including the perspective of persons with cognitive impairment in both research and practice has the potential to enhance their autonomy and improve their quality of life.   Dementia ,  Decision making ,  Everyday care ,  Preferences Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDMaintaining independence and control in decision making are issues of utmost concern to frail elders and persons with disabilities. Preparing and supporting people with chronic illness to maintain control in the face of declining physical and cognitive abilities will become even more important to society as the baby boomers reach old age in the 21st century and constraints on public financing for long-term care continue to mount.Despite the trend toward earlier diagnosis and greater public awareness of dementing illnesses, very little research has focused on the experience of persons with cognitive impairment (i.e., care receivers). The absence of the perspective of care receivers has led to a lack of representation of their needs in the selection of care strategies (Cohen 1991   ). One reason for this oversight is that researchers have only recently included persons with cognitive impairment in studies as "legitimate contributors" to the research process (Cotrell and Schulz 1993   ). As Woods 1999    has noted, "there has been the assumption that people with dementia are unable to communicate in a meaningful way, invalidating their participation in decision making about their own situation as well as rendering their lived experience and their perspective as being impossible to research" (p. 36). The major objective of the present study is to reduce this gap in the existing literature by examining the decision-making capacity of persons with cognitive impairment with respect to their everyday care preferences and needs.According to Stewart, Sherbourne, and Brod 1996   , subjective assessment in cognitively impaired populations has been ignored because of the presumed logistical and methodological issues, specifically regarding comprehension and reliability. As a result, researchers and practitioners often wrongly assume that persons with cognitive impairment are unable to make care decisions for themselves. Recently, however, in both research and practice, there has been a move to understand better the preferences and experiences of persons with dementia (Downs 1997   ; Kitwood and Benson 1995   ; Woods 1999   ). To date, the majority of the research on the emergence of the person in dementia has been qualitative. Downs 1997    outlines three areas that have been studied: (1) the individual's sense of self; (2) perspectives of persons with dementia; and (3) a person's rights. First, a growing body of research suggests that people with dementia retain a sense of self, despite cognitive impairment, into the late stages of the illness (Downs 1997   ; Kitwood 1997   ; Woods 1999   ). Further evidence that persons with dementia are able to report on their situation comes from the growing number of support groups and other services developed specifically for persons with early-stage dementia (Brod, Stewart, Sands, and Walton 1999   ; Yale 1999   ). Lastly, there is a growing trend toward acknowledging the rights of people with dementia (Downs 1997   ). A gap still exists, however, in exploring those individuals' values, preferences, and decision making for daily care situations.Even with the emerging interest in studying persons with dementia, the caregiving literature has generally emphasized either the family caregiver or the cognitively intact care receiver. Studies that examine both the family caregiver and the care receiver, with or without cognitive impairment, are rare (Young 1994   ). A gap also exists with regard to dyadic research, particularly when persons with cognitive impairment are involved. This body of research, which draws upon the work in marriage and family, typically examines the marital or parent–child dyad, with little or no attention paid to persons with cognitive impairment. The research on congruence between family members and older persons is also a relatively new area of study (Horowitz 1998   ), especially within the cognitively impaired population.The advances in diagnostic testing and the trend toward earlier diagnosis have created an opportunity for earlier and more consistent involvement in everyday care decisions for both the person with cognitive impairment and the family caregiver. Although the onset of cognitive impairment adversely affects a person's intellectual functioning, judgment or the ability to make decisions about his or her care are not uniformly impaired (Post and Whitehouse 1995   ; Rabins and Mace 1985   ; Sansone, Schmitt, and Nichols 1996   ).According to Wetle 1995   , "determining the capacity to make decisions is an inexact science" (p. 67). Most ethicists, clinicians, and researchers prefer the concept of "decisional capacity," recognizing that persons with cognitive impairment may be capable of making some decisions but not others (Kapp 1990   ; Sabatino 1996   ). Thus, depending on the situation, persons with cognitive deficits may have varying abilities in matters of decision making. For example, Mrs. M. may be able to decide who should make health care decisions for her even if she is no longer competent to shop for groceries. To date, no valid, standardized method exists to determine decisional capacity (Gerety et al. 1993   ; Kapp and Mossman 1996   ).Following diagnosis, mildly to moderately impaired persons and their families often begin planning for and adapting to the disease or disorder. Family members gather information about the disease process, talk with others who have had similar experiences, or determine potential service options. Persons with cognitive impairment may verbalize to family and friends their preferences for care, although this is not always the case. A person in the early stage of dementia who is confused and disoriented to time and place may still be capable of making choices and expressing preferences about many aspects of his or her care (Brechling and Schneider 1993   ).As the disease progresses, it becomes nearly impossible for the care receiver to voice preferences for care. During the later stages, the family caregiver faces the critical task of determining what services are available to keep their loved one at home, or whether another living arrangement is called for, such as a move to a nursing home. Unless the care receiver had previously expressed preferences for everyday care, it is nearly impossible to know what the individual wants and needs (Cotrell and Schulz 1993   ). Even when a caregiver makes decisions that reflect the care receiver's clearly stated choices, the family may experience considerable anguish and conflict. The lack of guidelines to help with identifying values and care preferences integral to the decision-making process, as well as the high costs of care, can amplify the family's distress.Case studies (Cohen and Eisdorfer 1986   ) and more recent research (McHorney 1996   ; Parmelee, Lawton, and Katz 1989   ) suggest that individuals who are mildly to moderately cognitively impaired are able to articulate their feelings, concerns, and preferences and provide self-assessments of their health status and quality of life. Direct assessment of the quality of life of mildly to moderately cognitively impaired persons has been found to be reliable and valid (Brod et al. 1999   ; Logsdon and Teri 1996   ). For example, McHorney 1996    reports that all 36 subjects who scored below 23 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ) were as able as cognitively intact older respondents to provide reliable, valid, self-report information about their health status on the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey. Similarly, persons with Alzheimer's disease scoring from 10–28 on the MMSE were able to complete a brief quality-of-life measure (Logsdon and Teri 1996   ). Although Logsdon and Teri found that persons with cognitive impairment were able to provide a valid and reliable assessment of their own quality of life, they also found that the care receivers' and caregivers' reports were related, but not identical. Brod and colleagues 1999    developed a 29-item instrument assessing quality of life and tested it with 99 persons with mild to moderate dementia (MMSE scores of 13–23). They found the instrument to be reliable with evidence of validity; nearly all (96%) were able to respond to questions appropriately. Although these few studies suggest that persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment can often respond to carefully designed instruments, it remains unclear when, in the course of dementing illness, individuals are no longer able to provide reliable reports (Logsdon and Albert 1999   ).Increasingly, most researchers studying quality of life support the notion that assessment of quality of life can and should only be made "by persons for themselves, about themselves" (Jennings 1999   , p. 97). In a study of medical decision making with 52 nursing home resident respondents with mild to moderate dementia and their proxies, the respondents were able to clearly communicate their desires and demonstrated decision-making consistency; only 13% of the respondents made inconsistent decisions (Gerety et al. 1993   ). Further, research suggests that about 30% of institutionalized adults with dementia can consistently make decisions about their health care, including, but not limited to, "do not resuscitate orders" and durable powers of attorney (Sansone et al. 1996   ). Purpose of the Study Building on this past body of work, the present study is one of the first to examine choice and decision making in everyday care for community-dwelling persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers, with a focus on perceptions, values, preferences, and practices in home- and community-based care. This article is the first in a series to report on findings from this study. We address the following research question: Are persons with cognitive impairment able to answer questions about their demographics, preferences, and choices, and their own involvement in decisions about daily living? Specifically, we report on the reliability and/or accuracy of the responses given by individuals with cognitive impairment. Determining a person with cognitive impairment's level of reliability and accuracy, and ability to state consistent preferences and choices is a necessary first step before exploring the decision-making process within the dyad (i.e., the care receiver and their family caregiver) and the congruence between the care receiver's preferences and the needs and practices of the caregiver. Methods Participants The sample consisted of 51 respondent pairs or dyads. Individuals with cognitive impairment (n = 51) and their family caregivers (n = 51) were recruited from Family Caregiver Alliance's (FCA) client lists in the San Francisco Bay Area and community outreach. FCA supports and assists families and caregivers of adults with cognitive impairment through education, advocacy, services, and research.The majority of care receivers were men (68.7%), White (74.5%), married (78.4%), and averaged 75.6 years of age (SD = 10.0, range 39–89). Most (68.6%) had at least some college education. The care receivers with adult children as caregivers (n = 16) had annual incomes between $8,000 and $29,000; those care receivers with spouse caregivers (n = 35) had median incomes between $40,000 and $50,000 a year. All care receivers had memory problems that had been diagnosed by a physician, with the most commonly diagnosed brain disease/disorder being Alzheimer's disease (51.0%), followed by other dementias such as frontal lobe, lewy body or vascular dementia (13.7%), stroke (11.8%), nonspecific dementia (9.8%), Parkinson's disease (7.8%), and other disorders (5.9%). The average MMSE score of care receivers was 20.8 (SD = 4.06, range 13–26), with two thirds (67%) considered mildly cognitively impaired (MMSE scores between 20 and 26) and one third (33%) considered moderately cognitively impaired (MMSE scores between 13 and 19).The family caregivers were most likely women (78.4%), White (78.4%), married (80.4%), and were on average 64.5 years of age (SD = 14.6, range 30–90 years), although over half (51%) were at least 65 years of age or older. More than two thirds (68.7%) were spouses and one third (31.3%) were adult children caring for a parent or parent-in-law. The majority (84.3%) had at least some college education. Most caregivers (23.5%) reported an annual family income between $40,000 and $49,000 a year (1997 dollars) with nearly two thirds (62.6%) reporting annual family incomes over $30,000. Almost half were retired (49.0%), and one third (33.3%) were in the labor force. On average, caregivers had been caring for their relatives for 3.1 years (SD = 3.4, range 1–23 years) and provided 80 hours of care per week (SD = 50.8, range 7–168 hours). Procedure Prospective participants were sent a letter describing the study and asking for their participation. Dyads were then screened by telephone to determine preliminary eligibility. To be eligible, family caregivers had to be: (a) the spouse or adult child of the person with cognitive impairment, and (b) the primary caregiver. The person with cognitive impairment had to: (a) have a confirmed physician's diagnosis of an adult-onset brain disease/disorder; (b) be living at home (i.e., living in the community rather than an institutional setting); and (c) be mildly to moderately cognitively impaired (scores between 13–26, as measured by the MMSE).If the caregiver agreed to participate, the research coordinator then telephoned the person with cognitive impairment to determine their willingness and availability to participate. Both the caregiver and the care receiver had to give verbal consent over the telephone to be scheduled for the interviews, and had to give written consent at the time of the first interview to participate in the research. Final eligibility was determined during the care receiver's Time 1 interview once the MMSE was scored, thus determining the individual's level of cognitive impairment.Of the 233 families identified, 21 (9%) could not be reached by phone to conduct the preliminary screening and 83 (36%) were found to be ineligible. The most frequent reasons for ineligibility were: care receivers being too impaired to be interviewed based on caregiver reports (45%); caregivers not meeting the initial inclusion criteria (18%); the care receiver being unable to participate (15%); placement of the care receiver in a skilled nursing facility or residential care (8%); caregiver moving out of the area (8%); or the death of the care receiver (6%).Thirty-four percent (n = 44) of the remaining 129 caregivers refused to participate for a variety of reasons, yielding a 66% acceptance rate. The most frequent reasons cited by the caregiver for choosing not to participate included the following: unwilling to participate or not giving an explanation for refusal (66%); the caregiver was too busy (14%); or other reasons (20%). Of the 85 eligible dyads, two were used for interviewer practice, yielding a final preliminary sample of 83 caregiver/care receiver dyads.About one third (n = 27 or 32%) of 83 eligible care receivers were screened out at the Time 1 interview, with 12 (44%) scoring less than 13 on the MMSE and 15 (56%) scoring above 26 on the MMSE. In addition, three (4%) care receivers were unable to complete the written consent process at the Time 1 interview; one (1%) care receiver declined to continue after the first interview; and one (1%) caregiver declined to participate at the scheduled time of the caregiver interview.Following the telephone screening, the research coordinator scheduled the in-person interviews. Experienced and trained individuals interviewed the caregiver and care receiver separately. For the most part, interviews were conducted with the dyads in their own homes. Every effort was made to ensure that the same interviewer was assigned to interview each member of the dyad.For this study, three interviews were conducted per dyad. The interviewing sequence and process required that the person with cognitive impairment be interviewed first to determine final eligibility with the MMSE score. Within one week, the family caregiver was interviewed and the person with cognitive impairment was interviewed a second time to investigate the reliability and stability of their responses (Sansone et al. 1996   ) and to ask additional questions. We chose this sequence and timing of interviews for two reasons: (1) to limit the potential for respondent attrition; and (2) because we recognized that the questions regarding daily living preferences and care decisions could generate discussion between the family caregiver and the care receiver between interviews that could affect their responses. Interviewers contacted the family caregiver the day before or the day of the interview to confirm date, time, and location. For the person with cognitive impairment, the interviewers generally contacted them the day of the interview to make certain they were able and willing to participate.Data collection began in July 1998 and continued for 10 months through April 1999 to achieve a final sample of 51 dyads (3 interviews per dyad or 153 total completed interviews). On average, the Time 1 interview with the person with cognitive impairment lasted 42 minutes (range: 24–103 minutes), and the Time 2 interviews, conducted one week later, took 50 minutes to complete (range 25–100 minutes). The interviews with the caregivers lasted longer, averaging 107 minutes (range: 27–193 minutes). Measures All measures for the larger study were pretested with a sample of six dyads to determine ease of comprehension, interview length, and appropriateness of vocabulary and content areas and revised as appropriate. For the present study, we report results based on five measures drawn from the larger study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE is an 11-item, widely used measure to assess seven dimensions of cognitive functioning on a 0 to 30-point scale: orientation and time (5 points), orientation to place (5 points), registration (3 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recall (3 points), language (8 points), and visual construction (1 point). Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. For purposes of the present study, the care receivers were categorized into three groups based on their MMSE score in the following way: low scores between 13–15 (n = 8) indicating greater cognitive impairment; medium scores between 16–23 (n = 27); and high scores between 24–26 (n = 16) indicating mild cognitive impairment. The Correct Scale. Adapted from the work of Sansone and colleagues 1996   , the Correct Scale assesses the care receiver's ability to respond accurately to 10 questions about specific factual information (i.e., day, month, and year of birth; number of children and siblings; education level; marital status; religious affiliation; and age). In Sansone and associates 1996    original study, a care receiver had to state her/his birth day, birth month, and birth year correctly in order to be scored as correct for date of birth. We decided to use each piece of information separately so that our version of the Correct Scale has three items rather than one for birth date. This revised scoring of date of birth more accurately represents the care receiver's ability to answer questions correctly. Also, Sansone and colleagues used this measure with a sample of nursing home residents with dementia, and respondent answers were verified by the nursing home's social service files. For the present study, we asked caregivers the same set of questions with the thought that the caregivers would be able to verify the care receiver's responses. Demographic Questions. Questions regarding educational level, ethnicity, religiosity, and such were asked of both the care receiver and the caregiver. Additional questions asked only of the caregiver related to their own employment status, living arrangement, and the number of hours a week providing care. As noted above, the care receiver was asked 10 demographic questions adapted from the Correct Scale at both the Time 1 and Time 2 interviews to assess accuracy and consistency of responses at two time points. In addition to obtaining the caregiver's demographics, the caregiver was also asked to confirm their relatives' responses to the demographic questions. The Preference Scale. Again, drawing upon the work of Sansone and colleagues 1996   , the Preference Scale assesses the care receivers' ability to choose or state a preference consistently over a one-week period. Respondents were asked four questions: "Do you like to watch television?" (yes/no); "Do you prefer winter or summer?" (winter or summer); "Which of these colors do you like the best?" (yellow, green or red); and "Which of these three ways do you prefer to have your eggs cooked?" (scrambled, fried, boiled, or don't eat eggs). Items were scored so that the respondents' ability to give a response was coded as 1; thus, responses could range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater ability to state a preference. Involvement in Everyday Living. These items were adapted from measures used in previous studies (Cicerelli 1992   ; High and Rowles 1995   ; Pratt, Jones, Shin, and Walter 1989   ; and Wetle, Levkoff, Cwikel, and Rosen 1988   ) to assess preferences for decision making about routine daily living. Participants were asked three questions: "Who is the person most involved in making decisions about how you spend your day?" (care receiver, caregiver, other relative, friend/neighbor, paid helper, other); "How much are you involved in making decisions about how you spend your day?" (not at all involved, a little involved, fairly involved, very involved); and "How do you feel about your involvement in making decisions about how you spend your day?" (not enough involvement, the right amount of involvement, too much involvement). Higher scores reflect greater levels of involvement by the care receiver. Data Analysis Care receivers were asked 17 questions to determine the test–retest reliability of their responses for the Time 1 and Time 2 interviews: 10 demographic questions (birthday, age, marital status, etc.), 4 questions from the Preferences Scale (favorite color, favorite season, etc.) and 3 questions about their own involvement in everyday living. Further, to determine if level of impairment was related to reliability of responses, care receivers were divided into three groups depending on their MMSE score (i.e., low MMSE: 13–15 [n = 8]; medium 16–23 [n = 27]; high 24–26 [n = 16]).The Kappa statistic, a coefficient for nominally scaled data (Roberto 1999   ), was used to determine if there was significant agreement between the responses given at Time 1 and Time 2. The advantage of the Kappa coefficient over percentage agreement is that it takes into account chance agreement (Coriell and Cohen 1995   ; Pett 1997   ). Thus, regardless of the number of nominal level responses possible, Kappa is based on exact agreement rather than nearness of response. Kappa values that approach 1.00 reflect that there is perfect agreement, whereas values that approach 0.00 reflect responses that would be expected by chance. For these analyses, we considered p values less than .05 as sufficient indicators of test–retest reliability. When Kappa could not be computed for nominal level data due to empty cells, chi-square statistics were used instead. Responses with interval data (i.e., age and number of children) were similarly tested using paired t tests.To determine accuracy, Kappa, chi-square, or t-test statistics were again computed, this time comparing care receivers' responses to the 10-item Correct Scale (Sansone et al. 1996   ) to those of their caregivers. Caregivers' responses were compared against the care receivers' responses at both Time 1 and Time 2. For analyses of test–retest reliability and response accuracy, we deleted cases when either respondent answered a question, "I don't know." Results Test–Retest Reliability Results revealed that, for the sample as a whole, care receivers were able to provide answers with significant levels of agreement to nearly every question (see  Table 1  ). In fact, of the 17 questions asked of care receivers, only one (the care receiver's age) yielded responses that were significantly different from Time 1 to Time 2. Even among those care receivers whose MMSE scores were lowest (MMSE 13–15, n = 8), significant levels of agreement were obtained for all but two questions: favorite season and favorite color. For these two questions, 17% and 40% of care receivers, respectively, were found to have unreliable answers. On the other hand, in this same subset, perfect agreement was obtained for marital status, whether the care receiver has children, and the question about how the care receiver feels about his/her level of involvement in daily living.Care receivers with medium MMSE scores (16–23, n = 27) answered reliably to all questions but favorite season and how involved the care receiver is in making decisions about how to spend his/her day. For these two questions, 19% and 52% of care receivers, respectively, were found to have unreliable answers. Perfect agreement was found for three questions: marital status, religion, and watching TV. Those with the highest MMSE scores (24–26, n = 16) answered only two questions unreliably: "Do you like to watch TV?" and "How do you feel about your level of involvement in your care?" For these two questions, 13% and 33% of care receivers, respectively, answered unreliably. Perfect agreement, with all care receivers providing the same answer at both the Time 1 and Time 2 interviews, was reached by this high MMSE group for six questions: day, month, and year of birth; marital status; children; and siblings. Accuracy In addition to answering reliably to basic questions such as birthday, age, and marital status, it was also important that care receivers were able to answer questions with a high degree of accuracy (i.e., validity). Accuracy was measured by the extent of agreement between the care receiver and the caregiver. Responses from the 10-item Correct Scale were analyzed twice, first comparing the caregiver's answers with the care receiver's at Time 1, then at Time 2. The average number of correct responses for the Correct Scale was 6.61 (SD = 1.4) for the Time 1 interview and 6.49 (SD = 1.35) for the Time 2 interview (range 2–8 correct responses for both Time 1 and 2). More than three fourths of the care receivers were able to answer at least 7 of 10 questions accurately during Time 1 (84.3%) and Time 2 (82.3%).In general (see  Table 2  ), the results indicate that care receivers were able to answer questions with a high degree of accuracy. Across the entire sample, significant levels of agreement between care receivers at the Time 1 interview and their caregivers were found for all demographic questions with one exception: "Do you have any children?" At the care receivers' Time 2 interview, there was significant agreement among care receivers' and caregivers' answers to all demographic questions.Similar results were found when analyses focused on level of cognitive impairment, that is, low, medium, and high MMSE scores. Specifically, those with the lowest MMSE scores responded accurately to nearly all questions at both Time 1 and Time 2. One question was answered inaccurately at Time 1 and Time 2 (whether the care receiver has children), whereas level of education was answered inaccurately at Time 1 and whether the care receiver has siblings was answered inaccurately at Time 2. Care receivers with medium MMSE scores responded accurately to all but one question at Time 1 (whether the care receiver has children) and reported accurately to all questions at Time 2. Care receivers with the highest MMSE scores were inaccurate when answering questions about the number of children at Time 1 and Time 2, and age at Time 2. Discussion The results of this study indicate that persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (i.e., MMSE from 13–26) are able to respond consistently to questions about preferences, choices, and their own involvement in decisions about daily living, and provide accurate and reliable responses to questions about their own demographics. These data support previous research findings that persons with dementia possess sufficient capacity to state specific preferences and make care-related decisions (Gerety et al. 1993   ; Sansone et al. 1996   ).It could be argued that the promising results related to test–retest reliability could be a result of memory effects that would have inflated our reliability estimates. However, given the small total sample size in this exploratory study, the even smaller sample sizes when the analyses compared low, medium, and high MMSE groups, and our conservative p values, we found that the number or proportion of dyads that were required to be congruent in order to demonstrate statistically significant levels was quite high. In the low MMSE group, for example, seven out of eight dyads had to be reliable in order to reach statistical significance. In addition, the cognitively impaired subsamples varied only slightly in the number of questions that were not reliable. If our results had been influenced by memory effects, we would have expected an increased number of reliable responses as level of impairment decreased (i.e., higher MMSE scores).With few exceptions (e.g., education, questions about children), family caregivers were able to confirm the care receivers' responses. For example, caregivers and care receivers did not always agree about the care receiver's level of education. In one dyad, the caregiving wife did not mention that her husband had attended college level courses, whereas the husband made a point to mention the coursework. For these and other questions, we relied on the comments of the interviewers to help determine if the caregiver and the care receiver were congruent in their responses. Similarly, in the total sample, dyads were found to be inaccurate or incongruent when responding to the question, "Does the care receiver have children?"This finding in the larger sample most likely reflects the results of the inaccurate responses of the low and medium MMSE groups. In other words, rather than indicating that persons with cognitive impairment uniformly respond inaccurately to a question about whether they have children, the results suggest this is true for persons who are more cognitively impaired. It could also be that persons who are more cognitively impaired misunderstood the question as asking, "Have you ever had children?" rather than "Do you have children who are currently alive?" This question may require higher cognitive functioning than other questions. In addition, it is puzzling why dyads with higher functioning care receivers were incongruent in answering questions about the number of children. These results reveal gaps in our understanding of "knowledge congruence" (Whitlatch 2001   ). Few studies have examined the level of agreement between family caregivers and cognitively impaired care receivers about subjective information (e.g., care preferences) or objective information (e.g., demographics). It will be interesting to see if our findings change as we examine these dyads over time.These findings suggest that family caregivers should not be assumed to be the "gold standard" for determining whether persons with cognitive impairment are able to accurately answer questions that relate to specific demographics. The findings also suggest that the level of "agreement congruence" (Whitlatch 2001   ) within a dyad (i.e., how much two persons within a dyad agree on certain issues or questions) may be influenced as much by the person's cognitive impairment as by the caregiver's lack of knowledge.In this study as well as others (Ashford et al. 1992   ; Willis et al. 1998   ), the MMSE was not found to be a sensitive measure of competency relating to capacity to state preferences and make daily care decisions. Although the MMSE, a measure of global cognitive impairment, has been widely used to screen for cognitive function, no valid, standardized, straightforward method exists to determine decisional capacity (Gerety et al. 1993   ; Kapp and Mossman 1996   ). In discussing the interviewing experience, the research interviewers in this study stated that some of the care receivers who screened out on the MMSE because of low scores would have been able to participate in the study and express valid and consistent preferences.It was also the interviewers' experience that the majority of the participants—both the care receiver and the caregiver—appreciated the opportunity to discuss issues related to preferences, values, and daily care decisions. When asked if they would like to participate in follow-up studies, virtually all (over 90%) dyads said they would be interested in participating in follow-up research. Several caregivers said that the questions asked during the interviews motivated them to seek additional support and assistance for themselves and the person with cognitive impairment.Many health care and social service practitioners have regarded cognitive impairment as a potential barrier to informed decision making and the ability to state wishes, values, and preferences. The results of this study suggest that persons with early to moderate cognitive impairment may well possess the capacity to express daily preferences for care and should be encouraged to discuss their everyday care wishes with their family caregiver. In turn, this would assist family members by helping them to better understand the wishes and preferences of their loved ones earlier in the disease process and before they, the family caregivers, inevitably must make difficult and often agonizing day-to-day long-term care decisions.The findings of this study are especially important when considered within the context of our larger study. The aim of our work in the larger study is to examine choice and decision making in everyday care for persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers. This study differs from previous research on decision making by its focus on: (1) a community-dwelling, cognitively impaired population; (2) the dyad, i.e., the person with cognitive impairment and the family caregiver; and (3) the exploration of values, preferences, and decision making for daily care. Given this broader context, our next task is to move beyond the Correct Scale and General Preference Scale (Sansone et al. 1996   ) developed to assess the reliability of specific factual information (e.g., current marital status) and general preferences (e.g., favorite season, like to watch TV), to answer more specific questions about the actual everyday values and preferences of persons with cognitive impairment (e.g., live in own home, be safe from crime, do things for self, feel useful, be part of family celebrations) and the caregivers' perceptions of these values. Understanding the importance of the care receiver's values and preferences that are more salient to day-to-day caregiving will be particularly useful for researchers and practitioners.Because of the exploratory nature of this research we did not use a theoretical model. Instead we relied on descriptive statistics and analyses for reliability and accuracy (e.g., Kappa statistics). Given our preliminary yet encouraging findings that persons with mild to moderate cognitive impairment are reliable and accurate respondents, we can move toward development of a theoretical framework and use more sophisticated analytic approaches that include the experience of people with cognitive impairment and their family caregiver. Caregiving research, in particular, lags in its efforts to incorporate the perspective of the person with cognitive impairment into theories of caregiving and related stress. In fact, the results from this study are currently being used to add dimensions of congruence to a more theoretically driven study of family decision making (Whitlatch 2001   ).A final limitation of this study was its relatively small, nonrandom sample and its cross-sectional design. It is important to recall that the study sample represented a group of predominately female caregivers, composed mainly of wives caring for their husbands, and daughters or daughters-in-law caring for their mothers or mothers-in-law with dementia. The caregivers and care receivers in our sample were highly educated, White, and in their early 60s or mid 70s, respectively, with moderate incomes. This sample, which is not unlike many in the caregiving literature, may not be representative of caregiver–care receiver dyads who do not seek or use formal services. This group, however, does reflect other caregiving samples (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, and Whitlatch 1995   ; Feinberg and Whitlatch 1996   ).Despite these limitations, this study has identified directions for the methodology, sample, and content of future research on consumer direction and decision making. The next step for researchers is to examine the stability over time of the measures employed in this study, and to explore the longer term effects of decision making in everyday care for persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers (e.g., well-being and service use).This study provides important preliminary evidence that persons with early to moderate cognitive impairment are able to articulate certain preferences and choices for themselves, and to be accurate and reliable in their responses. Including the perspective of the person with cognitive impairment—in both research and practice—is essential to empower this population, enhance their autonomy, and improve their quality of life.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined the formation of state government policies concerning persons with dementia. In particular, we identified variables associated with the passage of pertinent state laws by testing three theoretical models of policy formation: the iron triangle, the policy system, and an integrated model. Methods: We sampled 44 states and counted the number of laws concerning individuals with dementia that passed during the 1998 legislative sessions. We constructed nine independent variables to represent the three theoretical models of state policy formation. Then the number of legislative actions were regressed onto each model. Results: The integrated model that consisted of political actors, legislative features, and environmental inputs met goodness-of-fit criteria for a maximum likelihood regression analysis (χ2/df = 1.55). The advocacy effort of the Alzheimer's Association, number of legislative champions, supply of special care beds for persons with dementia, and recent policy activity were related significantly with increased legislative activity concerning individuals with dementia. Implications: Policy responses concerning persons with dementia increasingly have been created within state governments, and we identified variables associated with the passage of pertinent state laws. This research also contributed to the advancement of comparative state policy research by contrasting the three theoretical models of policy formation.   Alzheimer's disease ,  Public policy ,  State governments Laurence G. Branch, PhDForgetfulness and intellectual decline once were considered ordinary endpoints in the life course. These symptoms were thought to be so common among older adults that, in testimony provided to the Senate Special Committee on Aging in 1971, the American Psychiatric Association did not define senility as a treatable psychiatric illness (U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging 1971   ). Health professionals rarely assessed persons who presented these symptoms, and older adults with advanced senility often were sequestered to inpatient psychiatric hospitals, institutions for mental disease, or nursing homes where they received only the most basic custodial care (Kahn 1975   ).The conceptualization of senility as a normative process was not rejected until researchers determined that pronounced age-related changes in memory and intellectual performance often were caused by Alzheimer's disease and other pathogenic processes (Fox 1989   ). In 1974, Dr. Robert Katzman reported that neurological autopsies of senile older adults consistently revealed extensive neuronal degeneration, and high concentrations of the hallmark plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease. He recommended that senility be defined as a diagnosable psychiatric disorder—the clinical dementia syndrome—rather than a normative age-related process. Then, in 1978, the National Institute on Aging convened the first national symposium on Alzheimer's disease, and an expert panel confirmed that dementia was an insidious pathology that constituted a significant public problem (Butler 1984   ).Soon after, Senator Thomas Eagleton chaired the first Congressional hearing on Alzheimer's disease in 1980, and the federal government acknowledged that dementia required a concerted policy response. A national network of Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers was established in 1984, and the Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease was created in 1986. Congressional hearings on Alzheimer's disease continue to be held annually. Congress has steadily increased financial support for research and programs targeting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia to more than $500 million, and the Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease continues to review programs and policy issues (Advisory Panel on Alzheimer Disease 1995   ; Alzheimer Association 2000   ; Fox 1989   ).As the U.S. population continues to age, the number of persons with dementia is expected to increase as well. Manton, Corder, and Stallard 1993    stated that the prevalence of dementia should increase beyond the current rate of 7.3% of the over 65 population as other chronic health problems and causes of death become more responsive to treatment interventions, thereby increasing life expectancy and the probability of acquiring dementia. So, the continued development and implementation of federal policies should become even more pivotal in the next 20 years (Gatz, Lowe, Berg, Mortimer, and Pedersen 1994   ; Koenig, George, and Schneider 1994   ). The Role of State Governments Policy responses pertaining to persons with dementia also have been advanced by the state governments. In fact, Cutler 1986    and Lombardo 1991    argued that state governments assumed primary public authority for developing and implementing the public policies pertaining to persons with dementia, and Liebig 1993   , Van Horn 1993   , and Well, Wiener, and Holahan (1998) said that the roles and responsibilities assumed by state governments have expanded and become even more important in recent years.The National Conference of State Legislatures 1986   , Knight and Macofsky-Urban 1990   , and the Alzheimer Association 1999    compiled state policies pertaining to persons with dementia. We analyzed these policies and organized them into seven categories. The state policies included: (a) agenda-setting activity such as organizing a commission on Alzheimer's disease; (b) efforts to provide public education and service linkage; (c) financial and administrative support for biomedical research programs and service demonstrations; (d) implementation and regulation of residential health care, community-based health care, and social services; (e) establishment of professional requirements such as licensing, training, and staffing ratios; (f) provision of guardianship and protective services; and (g) tax credits, allowances, and other budget allocations concerning individuals with dementia and their caregivers.Further evaluation of the state policies revealed that legislative activity increased considerably during the 1990s. Kaskie 1998    found that the state legislatures targeted 150 discrete legislative actions toward persons with dementia between 1990 and 1997, and eight state legislatures passed 10 or more laws targeting persons with dementia during this period. This finding illuminated a research question that warranted further analysis: Why did some states pass more laws concerning persons with dementia than others?The primary objective of this research was to identify the influences of state legislative activity. To reach this objective, we tested how well three theoretical models of policy formation explained the passage of state laws pertaining to persons with dementia. We assumed that if we could identify the sources of variability across the legislative outputs, then we could determine why some states passed more laws than others. We also assumed that the research findings would assist advocacy efforts to enhance legislative activity across the United States.A second objective of this research was to illuminate the process of state policy formation more generally. Comparative evaluations of state policy outputs such as air pollution control, lottery adoptions, and Medicaid funding (Berry and Berry 1990   ; Meier and MacFarlane 1992   ; Ringquist 1994   ) have identified mechanisms of state policy making but have not definitively answered questions asking why state legislatures create variable outputs (Brace and Jewett 1995   ). By conducting a comparative evaluation of state dementia policy and testing three distinct models, we contributed to comparative state policy research methodology and shed more light on why state legislatures create such a vast assortment of laws. Three Theoretical Models of State Policy Formation The theoretical models selected for our analysis represented empirically supported conceptualizations of the convoluted process of legislative policy making. We also determined that the three models—the iron triangle, the policy system, and an integrated model—could be readily applied to the analysis of state dementia policy formation.The iron triangle model originally was formulated by Freeman 1955    after he observed the development of federal policies within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He concluded that the exchanges among interest groups, government agents, and elected representatives were critical to the formation of policies concerning the use of Indian lands. Other researchers (Gais, Peterson, and Walker 1983   ; Hamm 1986   ) conducted case studies in which the iron triangle was applied to help explain policy formation at the state level. Following this, we hypothesized that state laws concerning individuals with dementia were more likely to be passed in states with a greater advocacy effort made on behalf of people with dementia by local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association, a greater number of agency experts who pursued pertinent policy-making activities, and a greater number of legislators who supported relevant policies.In contrast, Easton 1958    argued that state policies were created within a system in which the procedural rules, professional capabilities, and ideology of state governments were more critical to shaping state policy outputs. Dye 1966    expanded the conceptualization of the policy system by arguing that environmental inputs, such as the wealth of a state and the size of its population, influenced policy outputs as well. Empirical applications of the policy system have been numerous and often done to the exclusion of the iron triangle, which was dismissed as secondary or nonessential to the policy-making process (if not difficult to evaluate empirically in comparative state policy research designs).We hypothesized that laws concerning dementia were likely to be passed by state legislatures that: (a) supported these sorts of policies ideologically; (b) were capable of responding to the needs of a vulnerable population; (c) were economically wealthy; and (d) had a large number of older adult citizens. In  Fig. 1 , we depict how state laws pertaining to persons with dementia may be shaped by an iron triangle and a policy system.Contemporary researchers have selected constructs featured in the iron triangle and the policy system, and have created an integrated model of state policy formation. In these integrated models, policy outputs were assumed to be shaped by political actors who operated within legislative institutions that were influenced by environmental characteristics (Ringquist 1993   ). In constructing an integrated model relative to state dementia policy, we made two modifications to the original integrated model. First, we included constructs of all three political actors featured in the iron triangle. This departs from previous research that either ignored the iron triangle altogether or only included a gross measure of interest group influence (i.e., per capita membership).Second, our integrated model included specifically defined measures of environmental inputs: per capita supply of special care beds for persons with dementia, and recent legislative activity concerning dementia. The inclusion of the former followed Ringquist 1994   , who found more substantive relationships among precisely defined constructs of the environmental context and a particular state policy output. We hypothesized that states with more special care services created more policies.The inclusion of the latter followed Khator 1993   , who determined that state recycling policies were influenced by the historical interest in recycling activity. We hypothesized that current state legislative activity was shaped by a historical precedent. So, in our integrated model, we assumed that dementia legislation passed in 1998 was related to the amount of legislative activity during the 1996 and 1997 sessions. Our integrated model of state policy formation is shown in  Fig. 2 . State Legislative Output The dependent variable was a measure of state legislative output: We counted the number of laws concerning individuals with dementia that passed during the 1998 sessions. By focusing on legislative activity, we disentangled the institutional origin of our policy output. We did not confound the influences upon the state legislatures with those associated with executive and judicial institutions (Meier 1993   ; Van Horn, Baumer, and Gormley 1992   ). Indeed, the variables that influence the formation of state law should not be confused with those that influence the creation of executive pronouncements, agency regulations, and judicial decisions. Bureaucratic agencies and the state courts should not be as responsive to constituency demands or economic deficits, for example.We recognized the limitations of this circumscribed construct. Counting the number of legislative actions provided only an elementary index of legislative activity. Whether or not the quantity of legislative action corresponded with the quality of law, or the implementation of the law by state agencies or interpretation of the law by state courts, was not tested in this research. Nevertheless, given the lack of a well-established research tradition in this area, we were confident that our focus was an appropriate place to begin. After all, state legislation represents the cornerstone of state policy activity. Without state laws, fiscal appropriations are less likely to be dispensed, programs are less likely to be developed and implemented, and cases are less likely to be brought to the courts (Holcombe 1926   ; MacDonald 1955   ; Rosenthal 1993   ). Methods Sample Our sample included the 44 states that convened legislative sessions during 1998. Because the Arkansas, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, and Texas legislatures only meet during odd calendar years, these states were not included in the analysis. Further, because we were interested in testing causal models of state policy formation, we focused on a single legislative session and did not confound our outcome measure by pooling activity across consecutive years (Gray 1976   ; Lewis-Beck 1977   ). Measures We constructed an outcome measure of state policy activity by counting the number of laws passed during the 1998 legislative sessions that pertained to individuals with dementia (Alzheimer Association 1999   ). We then constructed 11 independent variables from primary and secondary sources of data. After correlating the variables (see  Table 1  ) and completing auxiliary regressions, we removed two variables from further analysis in order to avoid problems associated with multicollinearity. In particular, the auxiliary regression analyses indicated that legislative professionalism had an R2 value of .75 (p < .01), and state revenue had an R2 of .72 (p < .01). The nine variables that were used to test three models of state policy formation are listed in  Table 2  . Dependent Variable: The Number of Laws Passed During the 1998 Legislative Sessions The Alzheimer Association 1999    compiled state legislation passed during the 1998 sessions that was most pertinent to the demented population. These laws were identified by staff analysts who tracked legislative bills using on-line state policy databases and key informants. In 1998, the 44 state legislatures passed an average of 2.23 (SD = 2.18) actions that pertained to individuals with dementia. California, Virginia, and Arizona passed nine, eight, and seven bills and amendments, respectively. Nine states (i.e., Alabama, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wyoming) took no pertinent legislative action. In  Table 3  , we list the different types of state laws that were passed during the 1998 sessions. Independent Variables Actions of the Alzheimer's Association. The first author conducted a survey of public policy staff from local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association in each of the 44 states (as identified by Mike Splaine, the State Policy Director from the Alzheimer's Association National Public Policy Office). The survey solicited information concerning: (a) participation in state-wide task forces concerning dementia; (b) public education efforts; (c) relationships with state legislators interested in aging and dementia; (d) relationships with bureaucratic agents; and (e) other pertinent policy-making activities.The policy staff and volunteers from the 44 chapters completed an average of 5.54 (SD = 3.90) policy-making activities during 1997. Eight chapters engaged in 10 or more policy-making activities, whereas two state chapters pursued none. Bivariate correlations indicated that this index of interest group activity corresponded significantly with the total number of hours that chapter staff dedicated to public policy making (.50; p < .01) and the amount of money the chapter allocated to public policy efforts (.45; p < .05), but the measure was not as strongly associated with the size of the chapter membership (.25; p < .01). This suggested that previous attempts to measure an interest group's political influence by estimating per capita membership were not necessarily valid (Graddy 1991   ; Haider-Markel 1999   ). Actions of Bureaucratic Agents. The Office of Technology Assessment 1990    suggested that the state departments of mental health and the state units on aging were heavily involved with the implementation of programs and policies pertaining to the demented population. After obtaining a sample of key contacts from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors 1998    and the Administration on Aging (M. Puccinelli, personal communication, 1998), the senior author conducted telephone surveys similar to those posed to the Alzheimer's Association.The number of state agents responsible for programs and policies concerning individuals with dementia ranged from one to four across the 44 states. Their influence on legislative outputs was estimated by summing the number of actions that each agent took to advance public policies. A state in which three agents each took two actions, such as convening a government task force on Alzheimer's disease and meeting with legislative staffers, received a score of 6. The survey responses revealed that the state agents engaged in an average of 3.70 (SD = 2.34) policy-making activities during 1997. Agents from 2 of the 44 states pursued more than eight policy-making activities, but agents from 4 other states did not engage in any such activity. Number of Legislative Champions. The Alzheimer's Association chapter staff and the bureaucratic agents also were asked to identify state legislators who supported policies pertaining to older adults, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, older adults with disabilities, or long-term care. The survey respondents identified an average of 5.68 (SD = 3.55) legislative champions. Six state legislatures included 10 or more champions, whereas respondents from two other states did not identify a single legislator who promoted dementia-related policies. Government Ideology. Berry, Ringquist, Fording, and Hanson 1998    constructed an index of government ideology from interest group ratings of elected officials, election returns for congressional races, the party composition of state legislatures, and the party affiliation of the state governor. This measure constituted an advancement in comparative state policy research because the researchers captured the shades of political ideology rather than categorizing states as Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. State government ideology averaged 56.34 (SD = 23.22) across the 44 states. The validity of the measure was supported by recognizing that traditionally more liberal states such as Hawaii and Vermont received much higher scores (i.e., 95.75, 85.12) than traditionally more conservative states such as Arizona and Utah (7.62, 3.00). Government Performance. Rice and Sumberg 1997    created a measure of state policy innovation and government effectiveness by estimating how well the states responded to unique policy problems. States with higher levels of innovation and effectiveness were more responsive to public crises and demands. For the 44 states included in this analysis, performance averaged −0.01 (SD = .75). New York and California received the highest ratings (1.59 and 1.41, respectively), and were considered the most responsive and effective state governments. Mississippi and South Carolina both scored −1.45. State Wealth. We collected measures of 1995 per capita income as an index of state wealth (Hornar 1997   ). Per capita income averaged $22,086 (SD = 3017.82) and was highest in Connecticut and New Jersey ($30,030 and $28,858) and lowest in Mississippi and West Virginia ($16,513 and $17,915). The measure correlated significantly (p < .01) with measures of per capita debt (.53), per capita state spending (.67), and per capita Medicaid expenditures (.58), confirming that per capita income represented a general construct of state economic activity. Proportion of Older Adult Citizens. Following the seminal work of Lammers and Klingman 1984    on the influence of older adults on state policy making, we gathered percentages of the states' older adult population as an index of constituency influence (Morgan Quitno 1996   ). The proportion of older adults averaged 12.68% across the 44 states (SD = 2.15). Florida and Pennsylvania had the highest percentage of older citizens: 18.42% and 15.92%, and Alaska and Utah had the lowest percentage: 4.63% and 8.82%. Per Capita Supply of Special Care Beds. Information concerning the number of special care beds for individuals with dementia was collected from the Nursing Home Statistical Yearbook (Cowles 1997   ). On average, the 44 states provided 11 special care beds for every 100 demented nursing home residents. Arizona and Colorado had the highest per capita rates (.26 and .24), and Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia had the lowest (.02, .02, and .01, respectively). Recent Legislative Activity. We created an index of recent legislative activity by counting the number of dementia-specific laws passed during the 1996 and 1997 sessions (Kaskie 1998   ). By focusing on the most recent activity, we distinguished the state legislatures that were recently active from those that passed legislation previously but not in recent years.The 44 state legislatures passed an average of 1.52 targeted actions during the 1996 and 1997 legislative sessions (SD = 1.71). Florida passed seven laws, and California and Illinois passed six. Fourteen states were inactive during the 1996 and 1997 sessions. We completed a square root transformation of this measure to approximate a normal distribution. Analysis Because this research constituted an inaugural examination of state dementia policy formation, we were less interested with establishing the strength of relationships among the variables and more concerned with establishing a direction for future research. Models were evaluated using a maximum likelihood regression analysis, and we applied traditional goodness-of-fit criteria (i.e., χ2/df < 2; Hu and Bentler 1995   ). Most of the state legislatures passed fewer than five laws during the 1998 sessions; therefore, the dependent variable reflected a positively skewed count of legislative actions and we specified a Poisson distribution in these analyses. Results The Iron Triangle We regressed the 1998 legislative actions onto the iron triangle model of state policy formation. This model, which included measures of the Alzheimer's Association advocacy effort, actions taken by experts from the state units on aging and departments of mental health, and the number of elected representatives who publicly supported issues concerning the aging population, did not reach goodness-of-fit criteria (χ2/df = 2.14). However, evaluation of the individual parameter estimates indicated that the actions of the Alzheimer's Association (χ2 = 5.80; p < .01) and the number of legislative champions (χ2 = 3.05; p < .08) were associated with 1998 legislative activity. The actions of the bureaucratic agents were not associated with legislative activity (χ2 = 1.58; p > .10). The results are presented in  Table 4  . The Policy System Next, we evaluated four measures that represented a traditional policy system. We specifically hypothesized that the number of legislative actions in 1998 was related to government ideology, government performance, per capita income, and the proportion of older adult citizens. The analysis indicated that the model did not reach goodness-of-fit criteria (χ2/df = 2.41). None of the individual determinants were associated with legislative activity: government performance (χ2 = 0.79), government ideology (χ2 = 1.18), per capita income (χ2 = 0.00), and the proportion of older adult citizens (χ2 = 0.13). The Integrated Model The integrated model met goodness-of-fit criteria (χ2/df = 1.55). Evaluation of the individual determinants indicated that four variables were associated with 1998 legislative activity: advocacy efforts of the Alzheimer's Association (χ2 = 2.88; p < .05), number of legislative champions (χ2 = 4.12; p < .05), measures of special care beds per capita (χ2 = 4.77; p < .05), and historical legislative activity (χ2 = 16.56; p < .001). We are careful to note that recent legislative activity was not correlated with any other independent variables (see  Table 1  ). Discussion The evaluation of the three models of policy formation provided valuable insights into the passage of state laws concerning persons with dementia. Testing a fully specified model of the iron triangle across 44 states, for example, revealed that political actors accounted for some of the legislative output during the 1998 sessions. The advocacy efforts of the Alzheimer's Association and number of legislative champions were associated with legislative activity, and these relationships maintained statistical significance when evaluated as a part of the integrated model. Our evaluation of the iron triangle also advanced the methodology of comparative state policy research because we demonstrated how the model could be applied to all the states, rather than a case study or convenience sample. This countered a long-standing tradition of ignoring iron triangles in comparative state policy research (Dye 1966   ; Easton 1958   ).The evaluation of the policy system provided some insight into the formation of state laws concerning individuals with dementia as well. For example, we found that the ideology of the state governments had no relationship with legislative activity. Policy outputs concerning dementia were not advanced selectively by one party or another; both liberal and conservative state governments supported policies for persons with dementia. This was reassuring, because the Alzheimer Association 2000    and other advocates have taken great effort to define the issues concerning dementia largely in nonpartisan terms. Advocates should persist in their efforts to advance state legislation, regardless of the electoral changes in state political majorities, governorship, and ideologies.We were somewhat perplexed that the measure of government performance did not correspond with the number of legislative actions taken during the 1998 sessions. We anticipated that more responsive states would target the problems associated with dementia and enact pertinent legislation. However, a recent survey of the National Conference of State Legislatures 1999    indicated that policy problems associated with dementia were not listed as a legislative priority; therefore we concluded that a measure that distinguished more and less responsive state governments may not have been so incisive. When dementia becomes a state priority, this measure may correspond with the amount of legislative activity.Our evaluation of the policy system also indicated that state wealth and the size of the older adult constituency were not related to the amount of legislative activity. On one hand, the lack of association between per capita income and legislative actions suggested that dementia policy making may occur independently from economic influences. Wealthy states were just as likely to pass laws as lass wealthy states, just as liberal states were just as likely to enact legislation as conservative states. On the other hand, because many of the laws passed during 1998 did not require a budget authorization (see  Table 3  ), the influence of state wealth may have been less critical in this analysis. Nevertheless, the findings support the continuation of advocacy efforts regardless of the states' level of wealth. Laws concerning persons with dementia, especially those that require no formal budget authorization, can be passed by wealthy and less wealthy states alike.Moreover, as the clinical dementia syndrome afflicts less than 10% of the older adult population, we may have been mistaken to presume that the older population in general would be interested in and supportive of pertinent legislative action. If we had evaluated a policy output that was of greater interest to the aging population (e.g., prescription drug benefits), then we may have found a relationship between state legislative activity and the size of the aging population. Still, a relationship between the size of the older constituency and age-related policy may not be so straightforward. Previous research by Lammers and Klingman 1984    argued that the influence of the aging cohort on state policy may have been suppressed by other variables such as political ideology.Taken together, these particular findings suggest that comparative state policy researchers may have overstated the importance of institutional features and environmental inputs on the policy-making process. For instance, the influence of government ideology may be limited to shaping partisan policy outputs. Issues such as abortion funding certainly are shaped differently in a conservative state government as compared to a liberal one (Meier and MacFarlane 1992   ). However, the explanatory power of this variable becomes lost when testing the formation of a nonpartisan issue such as the passage of laws concerning persons with dementia. Researchers, including those who examine other types of age-related state policy outputs, should consider the partisan nature of policy outputs before hypothesizing that their formation may be related with state ideology. We also determined that the influence of state government performance may only be helpful in explaining the formation of policy that necessitated an immediate response or captured the public imagination. Comparative state policy researchers should use this variable selectively as well; if an issue does not require an immediate response, then the effect of government performance may not be apparent.More important, we concluded that comparative policy researchers should acknowledge the failure of gross measurements to provide any incisive insights into the formation of state policy. Even if we did find a relationship between measures of wealth and constituency size, we would be at a loss to explain exactly how a legislature in a wealthy state with a large older adult population passes more laws. While previous evaluations have documented (and may continue to find) associations between constructs of economic wealth, constituency characteristics, and state policy outputs, we encourage state policy researchers to go beyond these descriptive associations and attempt to identify more precise causal mechanisms of state policy formation. The Integrated Model The most intriguing finding of our analysis was that the integrated model offered a convincing depiction of state legislative activity pertaining to persons with dementia. This was not surprising, as the model included all three of the political actors and substituted more specific measures of the environmental inputs (i.e., supply of special care services and recent historical activity for state wealth and the size of the older constituency). Analysis of the individual determinants revealed that the advocacy efforts of the Alzheimer's Association, the number of legislative champions, the per capita supply of special care beds, and historical legislative activity related significantly with legislative activity during 1998.The local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association engaged in a variety of advocacy activity during 1997. The efforts included educating public officials about Alzheimer's disease, participating in task forces, maintaining relationships with key legislative staff and bureaucratic agents, and lobbying in favor of dementia-specific legislation. These activities had some impact on the passage of state laws. In future research, we plan to analyze advocate activities in greater detail and answer the question: What exactly are the most effective steps that an advocacy effort can take to advance state dementia policy?The audience for this question includes more than the Alzheimer's Association. Other advocacy organizations such as the AARP (formerly known as the American Association for Retired Persons), the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and the National Coalition of Mental Health and Aging would benefit from knowing the most effective actions that can be taken to advance state policy for vulnerable populations of older adults. Moreover, we intend to resolve how to construct a valid measure of advocacy influence. If constructs of interest group influence are best created with primary data, then we could argue more strongly that comparative state policy researchers should be more cautious about using secondary data (e.g., size of the constituency or interest group membership) to construct these measures.After considering the relationship between the number of legislative champions and state policy activity, we surmised that the champions may have advanced laws because they held key committee assignments, or were more supportive of dementia policy because they themselves were older adults who implicitly understood the issues. Still, we did not resolve just how and why legislative champions actually influenced legislative outputs in this research. An in-depth analysis of legislative behavior may provide a more substantive contribution to understanding the formation of dementia policy in particular, and to comparative state policy research in general. If the specific characteristics or actions that legislative champions take to advance state dementia policy can be identified, then the sources of variability across state policy outputs may be understood in greater detail.We were encouraged that the precisely defined state environmental inputs were related to state policy formation. However, we did not determine how the number of special care beds actually influenced the passage of state laws pertaining to persons with dementia, especially because the majority of laws passed during 1998 did not concern special care beds or the institutions in which they were provided (see  Table 3  ). Perhaps this construct captured a more general effect of the market for dementia services. States with more special care beds also may have more day care and other programs for persons with dementia. Hence, these states may have a larger market of dementia services that requires more state policy activity.The strongest association in this evaluation was between the passage of state laws in 1998 and the legislative activity conducted in 1996 and 1997. The state legislatures were more likely to continue and pass laws in 1998 if laws pertaining to the demented population were approved in the preceding sessions. While this confirmed that past was prologue to the formation of state dementia policy, the finding did not establish how the legislative agenda was set initially or resolve how dementia policy stayed on (or was taken off) the legislative agenda. This study was not designed to resolve these more complex issues. Future Considerations This evaluation of state dementia policy formation can be improved in three distinct ways. First, future evaluations of the integrated model should incorporate variables to capture potential influences that were omitted in this research. These variables could include issue networks, geographic diffusion, and budget solvency. In examining issue networks (Heclo 1978   ), we can move beyond iron triangles and consider how larger networks support or prevent the advancement of state policies. In so doing, we can determine how the influence of the advocacy of the Alzheimer's Association may be moderated by the formation of a unified coalition that supports a particular state policy. We also can determine if and how the Association's effort may be mediated by other interest groups that oppose the advancement of state policies targeting persons with dementia.Moreover, Lieske 1993    suggested that the passage of an innovative state policy often stimulated a wave of activity among neighboring states. If one state legislature passed a unique law concerning individuals with dementia in 1997, then this may have encouraged legislative action in a neighboring state during the 1998 sessions. A more exhaustive integrated model would incorporate a construct that captures the potential effect of this sort of geographic diffusion in state policy activity.Although we did not discover a relationship between state wealth and state dementia policy, we are not convinced that the state economy has no relationship with state policy activity, especially if that activity involved legislative allocations. Perhaps the states that entered a legislative session with a budget surplus were more likely to pass legislation concerning individuals with dementia (Winn and Whicker 1990   ). We consider this to be a potentially important influence on policy activity that should be included in future evaluations.Second, future research efforts should resolve how the variables included in the integrated model shape the quality of legislative actions. In this research, we only assumed that a count of legislative action represented a valid construct of desirable legislative activity. If the quality of state legislative policy pertaining to persons with dementia has little or no relationship with the quantity of legislative activity, then the insights provided by the integrated model become less useful. Future research must determine if the quantity of legislative activity is a valid index of quality.Finally, future evaluations that attempt to explain the formation of state dementia policy must recognize that the policy-making process unfolds over time. The formation of an issue network, the influence of budget deficits, and the geographic diffusion of an innovative state policy may take several years before having an impact on specific legislative activity. The influence of these constructs cannot be captured in a cross-sectional evaluation or by an analysis in which influences and outputs are pooled over several policy-making sessions.We recognize the work of Berry and Berry 1990    as exemplary. They conducted a comparative evaluation of state lottery adoptions over a 10-year period and identified the significant determinants using an event history analysis. Although our research has provided some preliminary insights into the formation of state dementia policy, we are eager to follow the work of Berry and Berry and examine the formation of specific state dementia policies over a longer period of time. This would provide further insight into how dementia initially reached state legislative agendas, and illuminate the most critical determinants of legislative activity (or the lack thereof).In the meantime, this study established that the state legislatures have become a primary forum for the formation of an extensive array of policies pertaining to persons with dementia. The 44 legislatures that met during 1998 passed 98 laws that addressed no less than seven distinct topics. As the roles and responsibilities of American government continue to evolve within the state governments, analysts and researchers must focus on how the needs of persons with dementia are addressed within these forums.We also took an initial step toward explaining how state laws pertaining to persons with dementia were created. We evaluated three models of state policy formation and concluded that the passage of laws corresponded most strongly with an integrated model of policy formation. More specifically, we found that state laws pertaining to persons with dementia were associated with the advocacy effort of the Alzheimer's Association, the number of legislative champions, the supply of special care beds for persons with dementia, and recent legislative activity. By testing the models and illuminating the possible influences of state laws, we contributed to the development of policy responses made on behalf of older persons with dementia and also contributed to the analysis of other state policy outputs.

     Abstract Purpose: This article describes the organization, operation, and evaluation of the Oklahoma Aging Advocacy Leadership Academy (OAALA). Design and Methods: The Academy was designed to assure the continuation of future cohorts of advocates and volunteers for aging programs and services. It is a statewide training program consisting of 10 weekend sessions. The curriculum incorporates age-related content and advocacy/leadership/voluntary skills training. Evaluation consisted of: (a) a pre–post assessment of perceived familiarity with advocacy and volunteer leadership issues; (b) post-Academy participant assessments of the quality of various aspects of the Academy; (c) post-Academy written statements about areas that were valuable and in need of change; and (d) a compilation of student volunteer and advocacy activities. Results: Evaluation results indicate that the OAALA led to significant increases in perceived familiarity with issues and very positive participant assessments of quality. In addition, many participants spontaneously initiated advocacy and volunteer activities while enrolled in the Academy. Implications: Our experience with the Academy suggests that it is a feasible means of preparing individuals to become successful old-age advocates and volunteer leaders.   Volunteer training ,  Advocates ,  Instruction Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe Oklahoma Aging Advocacy Leadership Academy (OAALA) is an effort to identify and train volunteers from all adult age groups to serve as advocates for aging in the locations and programs of their choosing. This article describes the implementation and evaluation of the OAALA.From the earliest days of old-age policy, programs and policies for elders have depended on active and vocal advocates (Koff and Park 1993   ). By their very nature, grassroots aging advocacy efforts have drawn heavily upon motivated individuals who learn by doing; that is, they have tended to accumulate their technical expertise and policy savvy while they seek to bring about policy and program change (Brown 1985   ). Oklahoma, no exception to this experience, has a successful cadre of aging advocates who developed their advocacy skills primarily through many years of "working in the trenches." Due to their aging in place, the active involvement of members of the first cohort of Oklahoma aging advocates is limited by chronic illness and impairment, and their ranks have been diminished by death and institutionalization. Although the remaining individuals from the first cohorts continue to form a valuable core within the aging advocacy and volunteer groups in Oklahoma, many individuals in the aging network have become concerned about how to actively promote future cohorts of aging advocates.There are a number of reasons why a renewable core of well-trained aging advocates and volunteers continues to be a necessary component of age-related programs and services. First, the many political processes and the checks and balances that define the U.S. constitutional democracy necessitate strong advocacy efforts (Koff and Park 1993   ). For better or worse, politics is the major generator of policy change in the United States (Butler 1994   ), and advocates who understand political structures and processes are more likely to successfully negotiate this context.Second, the aging policy agenda has become complex, and the issues have become increasingly technical (Torres-Gil 1988   ). Aging is now a central theme in policy debates about taxation and expenditures, and it is likely to continue to be so in the future (Torres-Gil and Puccinelli 1994   ). The organizations, agencies, and programs claiming a voice in old-age policy debates continue to increase in number and diversity. The aging agenda (Conner 1992   ) has, in effect, become everyone's agenda. Therefore, it is important for advocates to have command of the diverse and complex issues that currently define age-related policy.Third, myths and misinformation about age-related policy abound in the press (Cohen 1994   ; Ekerdt 1998   ). Our policy makers are, at times, uninformed or misinformed about the older population and the impacts of aging programs (Torres-Gil and Puccinelli 1994   ), and some may harbor incorrect positive or negative stereotypes about older people and the aging process (Lubomudrov 1987   ). Individuals are needed who can carefully analyze and provide intelligent responses to campaigns that are designed to either create intergenerational conflict or foster negative public opinion about public programs for older people.Fourth, due partly to demographic shifts (Bengtson 1993   ), efforts of political groups to make the image of old age and aging programs more negative (Powell, Branco, and Williamson 1996   ), increasing generational claims on government resources (Quadagno 1989   ; Torres-Gil 1992   ), and differing values and political goals of more and less affluent elders (Wallace, Williamson, Lung, and Powell 1991   ), aging programs and policies are less universally accepted than they were during earlier periods when elders tended to be widely viewed as needy. The future of aging politics is in considerable flux, and there is a significant press toward more limited resources for the elderly population. The current and future quality of life of older people is being directly threatened (Binstock 1994   , Binstock 1995   ; Hudson 1996   ). These shifts in the policy landscape have arguably reduced the likelihood that individuals will volunteer as advocates for age-related policies and programs at the very point when effective advocates are needed to counter the unsupportive political environment toward aging policy.Sixth, strong and creative advocacy can generate policy and program innovation. At both the state and federal level, it is possible to track the beneficial impact of advocacy efforts on old-age policy (Koff and Park 1993   ; Lammers and Pynoos 1988   ). For example, in Oklahoma, advocacy efforts led to assisted living regulations that were far more beneficial than the original legislation, which was heavily backed by the state's nursing home industry.Seventh, volunteer leaders are important and necessary components of the overall support network for those elders who require assistance. The literature on volunteering suggests that many middle-aged and older individuals volunteer their time to causes, including old-age issues (Fischer, Mueller, and Cooper 1991   ). The rate of volunteering may have actually increased over the last two decades (Chambre 1993   ). There tends to be a high receptivity toward volunteering among those aged 55 and older who are near retirement or have recently retired (Caro and Bass 1997   ). However, more volunteers for aging programs may be willing to step forward if they feel that the opportunities open to them are both significant and challenging (Morris and Caro 1995   ).To summarize, we are experiencing attrition in the initial cohort of aging advocates at the same time as the political climate has made advocacy for old-age programs less attractive and the need for motivated, well-trained, and effective advocates and volunteers is increasing. These conditions led to the implementation of the OAALA and influenced its structure and content. Organization of the OAALA Developmental Activities The OAALA was the brainchild of the staff of the Aging Services Division of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. In late 1997, they began to seriously consider the need for some form of formal program to prepare future cohorts of aging advocates when they were directly confronted with the transitory nature of volunteer and advocacy efforts. A long-term and highly respected senior advocate reported that he would soon begin to limit his involvement in advocacy and told the Aging Services Division staff that it was time for others to accept responsibility. The staff established an advisory committee to explore this issue and to assist in all phases of the planning and development of the Academy. Initially, committee members included representation from the Aging Services Division, the Oklahoma Geriatric Education Center, the Oklahoma Center on Aging, the State Council on Aging, the Oklahoma Alliance on Aging, the Oklahoma Business and Aging Leadership Coalition, the Oklahoma Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and the Oklahoma Developmental Disabilities (DD) Council. Many members of the advisory committee were themselves senior advocates.Committee membership was expanded as the planning process evolved and the need for other expertise surfaced. For example, when the committee identified the state's business community as a target for potential program applicants, representatives from two retired senior executive corps groups were recruited because of their success in working with businesses. The Academy advisory committee established several goals for the OAALA, including preparing participants to: (a) undertake leadership and advocacy roles in their communities; (b) accept volunteer positions in local, state, or national organizations; and (c) serve as knowledgeable sources of information about aging in an area that each individual personally selected.In 1998 the Academy was developed and implemented through a grant from the Oklahoma DD Council. The DD Council had become increasingly concerned about aging persons with developmental disabilities. Furthermore, they had experienced considerable success with their own statewide leadership-training program. Therefore, they were willing to fund an integrated advocacy-training program that incorporated disability topics. The DD Council funded one year of development and two years of project operation. The funding from the DD Council made it possible to reimburse Academy participants for travel, including hotel stays, to supply books and other educational materials, and to recruit nationally recognized program leaders.We have begun the process of seeking continuation funding from Oklahoma businesses. Thus far, commitments of monetary support have been received from Southwestern Bell, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, and a regional senior housing development company. In late 2000, we polled administrators of these corporations to learn about their motives for supporting the OAALA. They gave us the following reasons: (a) the Academy helps enhance the capabilities of employees by teaching them about aging, leadership, policy, and advocacy issues; (b) it provides useful information (e.g., referral agencies and community resources) about how to deal with the special needs of employees who are providing support to older family members; and (c) businesses are becoming more concerned about the older population as an important marketing segment, and information about the older population can support marketing initiatives. Therefore, beyond the obvious altruistic and visibility motives associated with underwriting a statewide leadership training program, the companies view the Academy as a long-term investment in their employees and their businesses. We have also received in-kind support from other state agencies and organizations, as well as some Academy presenters.In the process of planning the OAALA, we searched widely for existing leadership and advocacy models, particularly those with an emphasis on aging. Among the Oklahoma models we examined were the Partners in Policymaking model, which the Oklahoma DD Council uses for advocacy training; two local community leadership training programs; and the Leadership Oklahoma program, a year-long statewide leadership training activity. Among the programs from other states that we considered was the National Leadership Institute on Aging program, which focused on developing participants' capacity to design and deliver strategic and innovative aging services. This program is no longer in operation. The New York Institute for Senior Action is designed specifically for elders who are dedicated to social justice. The Senior Leadership Enhancement Initiative, a component of the Duke University Leadership in an Aging Society Program, focuses on small cohorts of citizens who have already established distinguished careers or strong records of involvement in civic involvement. It gives awardees an opportunity to work with Duke faculty and students on a personalized, year-long leadership development program. Although the ultimate model developed for the OAALA was a hybrid, incorporating the most appropriate elements of all of these programs, the general approach that we employed (described below) relied most heavily on the Partners in Policymaking model. Interested parties are invited to contact the first author for a more complete description of the model, the curriculum, publications, speakers, and marketing and application materials.The Aging Services Division contracted with the University of Oklahoma Geriatric Education Center to develop a draft curriculum with guidelines for core learning activities. In order to assure that the developing curriculum addressed appropriate topics and incorporated acceptable approaches to learning, we involved current senior advocates in a series of three focus groups: One focus group was organized to identify curriculum topics, and two were employed to evaluate the evolving curriculum. Focus group membership included senior leaders from AARP, senior advocates, the Silver Haired Legislature, the Oklahoma Alliance on Aging, and the State Council on Aging. The focus group findings were very useful in finalizing the Academy curriculum. Educational Model and Curriculum The educational model that evolved was designed to suit the needs and interests of adult learners, especially those who have been away from an academic setting for many years. The overriding goal of the model is to employ a learner-friendly format that limits didactic sessions. Instead, the weekend sessions emphasize brief presentations, discussion sessions, experiential activities (during and outside of the weekend sessions), small work group activities, student presentations of their projects, exercises in critical thinking, and role playing.The curriculum includes two basic tracks: specific age-related content and advocacy/voluntary skills training. Elements of these two tracks are blended throughout the 10 weekend sessions. The use of panels, especially those including older persons and caregivers for impaired elders, has been very popular with Academy members.  Table 1  summarizes the basic topics covered in the sessions. Recruitment and Selection of Participants We have sought statewide participation in the OAALA. Two distinct groups are specifically targeted for recruitment: (a) those who are retired and ready to become active as advocates and (b) baby boomers, who are often just beginning to deal with aging issues and concerns as they are accepting caregiver roles. We do not specifically target the staff of area agencies on aging (AAAs), although AAAs have been actively involved in recruiting qualified applicants within their service areas. The general public is informed about OAALA through news releases. Packets containing a description of the Academy and application forms were developed and distributed. The formal and informal aging, health, and social services networks receive the information/application packets. The Executive Service Corps of Central Oklahoma (TESCO) was asked to develop strategies for attracting applicants from the business community. TESCO designed and implemented a plan for contacting human resources personnel in large companies throughout the state.The application forms request demographic information and also ask applicants to develop written descriptions of both their interest in OAALA training and their philosophy of advocacy and volunteerism. Applicants are also asked to include letters of recommendation in their application packets.A selection committee consisting of representatives from existing aging advocacy organizations reviews the applications and makes the final decisions about acceptance into the Academy. The selection committee gives considerable weight to the narrative statements and the letters of recommendation, although they also seek to make the class broadly representative with regard to age, sex, geographic region, and type of employment. The initial cohort had approximately equal numbers of men and women. The first class ranged in age from 24 to 70, although most were in the "baby boom" ages of 40 through 55. Four African Americans and two Native Americans participated, although most participants were White. Occupations, or former occupations for retired individuals, included a phone company employee, a nurse, a pastor, an adult day services center administrator, an aircraft company employee, a university personnel services worker, a housing manager, a health department employee, and a hotel human resources manager. The second class was similarly diverse. Members of the second class ranged in age from 26 to 72 years old. Seventeen were White, two were African American, and three were Native American. Four of the state's five major geographic regions were represented in the second cohort, and the class members had a range of current or past occupations that was similar to the first cohort. Schedule and Operation The Academy meets one weekend each month from September through July, excluding the month of December. All sessions are held in Oklahoma City, which is located near the center of the state. Each session runs from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Friday evening and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. Participants arrive on Friday at 5:00 p.m., when dinner is served. Because some Academy participants have just finished a week of work and many have driven several hours to get to class, one of the lighter topics or a topic involving participant interaction is scheduled for Friday evenings. Another Friday evening activity is the sharing of "opportunities and experiences" or homework, which participants complete between sessions.The Saturday morning session begins at 8:00 a.m. with a continental breakfast. Training activities start at 8:30 a.m., and except for brief breaks and a 45-minute lunch, continue until 5:00 p.m. The main session leader is usually scheduled during the morning 3-hour session. The afternoon is typically divided among several presenters or session leaders, and often panels of speakers address the topic. The typical day finishes with a short review and discussion of the "opportunities and experiences" due at the beginning of the next session.Homework assignments are designed to give students an opportunity to apply what they have learned in real-world settings. For example, they are asked to develop a personal resource file on an age-related topic of their choosing. The file is begun early in the year, and it grows as the participant researches the topic. The resource file is shared with other participants as the Academy progresses. At various times, participants are also asked to engage in such activities as: (a) gathering information about their local AAAs and other age-related resources; (b) researching a topic that they would like to see become a bill in the future; (c) writing a persuasive letter to their legislator concerning an issue they believe is important; (d) preparing a "talking paper" on an issue; (e) visiting a life-care facility, nursing home, or assisted living center and writing down impressions; (f) interviewing a primary caregiver for an older person; (g) calling a family meeting with the goal of discussing end-of-life issues and completing a personal advance directive; and (h) writing a news release on a topic of interest.During each monthly session, Academy participants hear directly from agencies and organizations that rely on volunteers. They hear personal accounts of successes and failures in leadership, volunteering, and advocacy from the people who have been directly involved. The personal testimonies of advocates, volunteers, agency staff, and policy makers seem to have a dramatic impact on participants as they determine what types of advocacy and volunteer activities they want to pursue and what types of expertise they will develop as they begin to address these activities. As one example, in each of the past 2 years, two participants have volunteered to become involved in the nursing home ombudsman program after hearing from the state program director.The quality of the faculty recruited to provide instructional leadership contributes greatly to the overall success of the Academy. Presenters are drawn from universities, national aging advocacy organizations, state and national government agencies, and the Association for Clinical Pastoral Counseling. Representatives of private business, caregivers, and volunteer advocates also make significant contributions by serving on panels or as faculty members. Presenters have come from Oklahoma, Washington State, Washington, DC, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, and Utah.All participants are provided with a portable file box to organize the hanging file folders that they receive at each session. The file folders contain an agenda, biographies of the session leaders, and handouts covering session topics—some of which are prepared by Academy staff members, and others prepared by the speakers. From time to time, as appropriate, Academy participants also receive published texts pertaining to the Academy curriculum. Evaluation and Impact Each new cohort of OAALA participants is asked to complete a questionnaire that addresses their perceived familiarity with 65 issues associated with the Academy curriculum. Level of familiarity with each issue is measured by means of a 7-point item ranging from very familiar (6) to not at all familiar (0). A wide variety of topics is included: (a) general aging (e.g., social aspects of aging, demographics of aging, rural–urban differences); (b) communications and leadership strategies (e.g., oral communication, written communication, planning meetings, holding meetings); (c) policy issues and processes (e.g., how state policy is made, how to get a sponsor for a bill, state legislative calendar); (d) types of aging services and programs (e.g., Medicare eligibility and benefits); (e) Medicaid eligibility and benefits, long-term care policies, nursing home policies); and (f) advocacy skills (e.g., media advocacy strategies, successful negotiation strategies, how to search for advocacy information, how to prepare a talking paper on a topic). Participants complete the questionnaire prior to and upon completion of the Academy. Pre–post intervention self-assessments of knowledge and of familiarity with topics are problematic program evaluation strategies from several perspectives. However, we decided that because these are adult learners who come from many different backgrounds, have a range of educational attainment, and enter the Academy with a wide variety of areas and levels of expertise, we did not wish to confront them with direct tests of knowledge.For the first cohort, the mean increase in scores across all sixty-five 7-point items was 2.5 on the 7-point scale. We employed the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic to assess the significance of the pre–post change, because this test is appropriate for paired observations and it does not require an assumption of normal distribution. The results were significant (Wilcoxon signed rank statistic, 75.5, n = 17, p = .0001), suggesting that participants felt much more familiar with the topics, on average, after completion of the Academy. The items with the highest score increases (3.5 points or higher) were: (a) how to provide testimony to a legislative committee, (b) how to get a sponsor for a state legislative bill, and (c) the state legislative calendar. Items with the lowest increases (less than 1.5 points) were: (a) understanding your personal value system and (b) the role of exercise for older people. As might be expected, familiarity scores increased most in the areas the participants felt least familiar with at the outset, and they increased least in the areas in which the participants saw themselves as most familiar prior to the Academy. Similar results were obtained for the second cohort.At the conclusion of the Academy, participants are asked to provide their impressions about the quality of 18 aspects of the Academy. A sample of the elements that are covered include quality of presentations, appropriateness of topics covered, appropriateness of exercises, quality of required readings material, overall quality of the Academy, how well the Academy participants are prepared to be successful aging advocates, and match between what was expected of the Academy and what was actually received. The perceived quality items are also evaluated on a 7-point scale from 0 (very poor quality) to 6 (excellent). For both the first and second cohorts, the mean score across the 18 items was 5.6, indicating a very high overall assessment of quality on the part of the participants. Mean first/second cohort scores for selected items that reflected general assessments of the program were: quality of information provided (5.7 / 5.7), overall quality of the Academy (6.0 / 5.8), and overall satisfaction with the Academy (5.9 / 5.8), respectively.In the post-Academy assessments, participants are encouraged to jot down the three best aspects of the Academy and the three aspects of the Academy that should be improved. The most frequently mentioned positive elements across the first two cohorts were the opportunity to network with other participants and speakers (23 mentions), quality and variety of information provided (21 mentions), and quality and diversity of speakers (16 mentions). Five participants indicated that hotel accommodations should be improved.Perhaps the best measure of any positive impact of the Academy, as well as the motivation of the participants, is the projects and activities of the first Academy class.  Table 2  presents a sample of the accomplishments of the participants. Several issues regarding the activities in the table should be noted. First, many Academy participants are currently successfully engaged in more than one voluntary or advocacy activity. Second, because the Academy participants were recruited from throughout Oklahoma, their activities are benefiting communities in all regions, including rural and urban settings. Third, some of the items in  Table 2  are not typically associated with traditional aging target groups, and they include both political actions and volunteer service activities. The participants are neither required nor expected to work solely on aging issues. Fourth, many of these activities were spontaneously initiated during the 11-month term of the Academy. They were not, in most cases, the result of any specific Academy requirement. Discussion State and local components of the aging network may consider many different approaches for ensuring the continuance of skilled and motivated volunteers and advocates for older people. Our initial experience with the OAALA suggests that the Academy model is one strategy to seriously consider in this regard. Although the long-term impact of the Academy cannot be measured at this point, we have found it to be an effective means of identifying and preparing supporters of age-related programs and policies.The implementation of the Academy has fostered several positive developments, some of which were not planned by the Academy staff. First, it has led to the self-identification of people who are interested in aging advocacy and volunteer activities but who, in most cases, neither had significant prior involvement nor had made a strong personal commitment to these activities. Second, the Academy provides participants with relevant skills and a knowledge base that should give them the foundation to be successful volunteer leaders and advocates. Third, the Academy reinforces the notion that volunteering and advocacy for elders are crucial and challenging activities, which should, as Morris and Caro 1995    have noted, enhance their motivation to initiate and continue such activities. The very action of establishing a special statewide Academy for aging advocacy and leadership in itself lends both visibility and distinction to these activities. Fourth, the Academy assembles a group of diverse but like-minded people who learned from one another and generated enthusiasm among themselves. Fifth, the spontaneous actions of some members of each class to organize successful volunteer activities and advocacy efforts as the Academy progresses generate considerable motivation among other class members to "get out there and get involved."Sixth, at the request of members of the first class, an alumni organization has been established. One spin-off of the alumni association has been the development of a series of informational programs specifically designed for Academy graduates. The graduate program provides in-depth workshops on topics that are relevant to aging-related volunteering and advocacy. It extends and reinforces knowledge developed during the Academy. The alumni organization also provides graduates with a means of continuing their attachment to the Academy and to their classmates, gives them ongoing opportunities to learn from one another by sharing their successes and failures, and maintains enthusiasm for volunteering and advocacy. We believe that this element of the Academy, which grew out of the interests of the participants themselves, will help to assure continued involvement of Academy graduates in aging-related advocacy and volunteer leadership activities well into the future.The OAALA has also had a beneficial impact on the aging network in Oklahoma. Seeing the value of the speakers who are scheduled for the Academy, those who are currently working or volunteering in the network have asked to have an opportunity to avail themselves of the speakers. As a result, the Aging Services Division staff has established a special workshop series for current network participants. The workshops are scheduled on the Friday afternoons prior to the monthly OAALA meeting in order to make efficient use of the Academy speakers. Therefore, we can count improved continuing education opportunities for the aging network as another positive result of the Academy.  None  Table 1. Summary of Session Topics  View Large Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the prevalence rating of depression in nursing homes as flagged on the Minimum Data Set (MDS) quality indicator report. Design and Methods: Research Staff measured depression symptoms and compared the results with the prevalence of disturbed mood symptoms documented by nursing home (NH) staff on the MDS in two samples of residents living in different NHs. The homes had been flagged on the nationally mandated MDS quality indicator report as having unusually low (Site 1) or high (Site 2) prevalence rates of depression. Results: The percentages of residents determined by research staff interview assessments to have probable depression in the two resident samples were not significantly different (49% vs. 55%, respectively) between homes. The staff in the home flagged on the MDS quality indicator report as having a high depression prevalence rate identified significantly more residents who also had scores indicative of probable depression on the resident interviews for follow-up mood assessments than did the home with a low quality indicator prevalence rate (78% vs. 25%, respectively). Implications: The prevalence of the depression quality indicator may be more reflective of measurement processes than of depression outcomes. Factors that may affect the difference in detection rates are discussed.   Quality indicators ,  Depression ,  Minimum Data Set Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDThe development of quality indicators (QIs) based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) reports is a relatively recent and important innovation that should improve the effectiveness of quality assurance activities for all nursing homes (NHs; Arling, Karon, Sainfort, Zimmerman, and Ross 1997   ). Currently, quarterly reports that compare individual NHs to all others within their respective state on 25 QIs are generated for all NHs in the United States. For example, the prevalence of the QI related to incontinence is adjusted into high and low risk groups on the basis of resident characteristics associated with incontinence (e.g., immobility, cognitive impairment). Individual NHs and survey staff are provided with a quarterly written report that provides a comparison of incontinence prevalence rates for all other facilities within the state. A facility that reports a 50% incontinence prevalence rate for low-risk residents, for example, might be placed in the 75th percentile in relation to other within-state facilities. This facility may, thus, be "flagged" on this QI with the consequence that state survey teams might pay particular attention to incontinence issues during their annual visits. Other QIs, such as the prevalence of depression, are not risk adjusted when comparisons are made against other facilities.Preliminary work has described the stability and reliability of the MDS-based QIs despite the acknowledgment that more work needs to be done to understand what is being measured by the indicators (Karon, Sainfort, and Zimmerman 1999   ; Zimmerman et al. 1995   ). More specifically, if the QIs are to be useful for both internal and external quality assurance purposes, then it is necessary to determine what factors differentiate facilities that score high and low on different indicators. There is a chance that even highly different percentile rankings on the QIs might not always reflect differences in care processes but rather differences in assessment processes. This article provides preliminary data relevant to this issue for the depression QI. Methods Participants and Setting Participants were residents in two NHs in Southern California who were participating in a National Institutes of Health-sponsored clinical trial to evaluate the effects of an incontinence and exercise intervention. Site 1 was a 150-bed profit facility and Site 2 was a 200-bed nonprofit facility. There were two other important differences between the NHs that are directly relevant to the focus of this article. Site 2 was a university-affiliated facility and contracted for mental health services with the university. The mental health team frequently interacted with NH staff, maintained an "on-site" office, and attended many resident care meetings. The proprietary facility did not have an in-house mental health staff and, thus, referred all residents with psychiatric problems to off-site mental health staff. The second difference between the homes was that the proprietary facility (Site 1) had been flagged on a nationally mandated quality indicator report as having an unusually low prevalence rate of depression symptoms (1%), which placed them in the 1st percentile compared with all other California NH facilities. Site 2, the university-affiliated facility, was flagged as having an unusually high prevalence rate of depression symptoms on the same report (12%), which placed them in the 70th percentile compared with all other California NH facilities. The QI report covered the same time period that research staff directly assessed depression on samples of residents within both homes who were participating in the clinical trial.The resident recruitment procedures in the two homes were identical. All residents in both homes who were incontinent and without a catheter, aged older than 65 years, able to comprehend English or Spanish, and able to pass a screen of responsiveness were eligible for this trial. The responsiveness screen required residents to state their name on request or reliably identify two common objects. A resident had to fail the screen on two separate occasions to be excluded from the trial.The NH staff identified 311 (84%) residents at both sites as incontinent. Of these incontinent residents, 206 (66%) met the inclusion criteria for the intervention trial. We obtained informed written consent, or the consent of a respective family member and the assent of the resident, from 148 (72%) of the eligible residents. We lost 18 consented residents prior to the beginning of the intervention trial for various reasons (e.g., death, transfer out of facility, consent withdrawal). We lost an additional 21 residents following the beginning of the intervention trial, primarily because of hospitalization or death.Thus, 109 residents remained for participation in this study. We obtained all demographic and MDS information for the 109 participants. However, we only obtained depression interview information for 91 of these residents. Of the remaining 18 residents, 8 refused to cooperate with the interview, 6 were unable to participate in the interview (i.e., no response or nonsense responses to the interview questions), and 4 were not available for the interview (e.g., out of the facility, with family, in an activity). Measures We used two assessment instruments in this study. The Geriatric Depression Scale Short form (GDS-short) and the most recent MDS assessment, which is completed by the NH staff (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, and Lum 1983   ). The 15-item short form of the GDS has been specifically recommended by one practice guideline as a screen for probable depression in NH residents (American Medical Directors Association 1996   ). In this study, we administered the GDS-short to each participant in a one-on-one interview format because of the presence of cognitive and visual limitations among the NH residents in the samples. Despite the indication that the sensitivity and specificity of the GDS-short in detecting depression is reduced among individuals with dementia, researchers have documented that a total score greater than 5 on the GDS-short is related to probable depression (McGivney, Mulvihill, and Taylor 1994   ).In consideration of the possible influence of dementia on the reliability of GDS-short scores and to evaluate the stability of resident interview responses, we attempted to conduct a second GDS-short interview for a subsample of 11 residents in Site 1 (n = 33) and all residents in Site 2 (n = 58) who completed the first GDS-short interview. We attempted the second GDS-short interview on the day following the initial GDS-short assessment (i.e., two consecutive assessment days) at the same time of day (i.e., between 3 and 4 p.m.). Of the repeat interview attempts with 73 participants, nine residents in Site 1 and 39 residents in Site 2 (n = 48) provided complete interview information for the second GDS-short assessment. The remaining 25 residents either refused or were unavailable for a second interview (e.g., with family, in an activity, out of the facility).We retrieved the MDS assessment (i.e., quarterly or annual) closest to the date of the GDS-short interview for each participant to assess NH staff documentation of the MDS items that trigger a follow-up assessment for a potential mood disturbance. These 16 MDS mood items are found in "Section E1: Indicators of Depression, Anxiety, and Sad Mood," Items A through P (Health Care Financing Administration 1999   ). Finally, for the two samples of residents for whom GDS-short interview data were available, we generated the prevalence of the same depression QI that was generated by the state for all residents in the facility. MDS items that are used to generate the depression QI include the following: (a) Section E, Item 2 (sad mood); and (b) at least two symptoms of functional depression as measured by Items E1a (negative statements); E1g (suicidal or recurrent thoughts of death); E1n (repetitive physical movements); E1o (withdrawal from activities); E1p (reduced social activity); E1j (wakes with unpleasant mood), N1d (not awake most of the day), or N1a,b,c and B1 (awake one period of the day or less and not comatose); E4a (resists care); and K3a (weight loss). Data Analyses We compared all demographic and MDS information for those residents who provided complete interview data (n = 91) versus those who did not (n = 18). We conducted these same comparisons between those who participated in this study (n = 109) versus those who dropped out of the study (n = 39) and between the samples at each of the two NH sites. Finally, we also made a comparison between those who completed a GDS-short interview (n = 91) versus those who did not, for any reason (n = 39 + 18 = 57). We conducted independent sample t tests for all continuous variables (i.e., age, length of stay, Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE], total number of MDS symptoms of disturbed mood) and chi-square analyses for categorical variables (i.e., gender, ethnicity, presence or absence of a dementia or depression diagnosis, presence or absence of a "trigger" for disturbed mood). We conducted all statistical comparisons between homes with nonparametric analyses (chi-square). We analyzed the agreement between the two GDS-short assessments with Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients for GDS-short total scores and Kappa statistic for classification into two groups, those with GDS-short scores >5 (i.e., indicative of probable depression) and those with GDS-short scores ≤5 according to each of the two assessments. Results The mean age of the 91 participants was 89.1 (SD = 6.9). The participants were predominantly White (96%) and women (88%) with a mean length of stay of 26.8 (SD = 33.1) months. The mean MMSE score for the participants was 13.4 (SD = 7.7) with almost a full range of scores represented by the group (i.e., 0 to 29). Thirty-seven (41%) of the participants had a physician-recorded chart diagnosis of dementia. There were no significant differences on any of these descriptive characteristics between participants who completed a GDS-short interview (n = 91) and those who did not (n = 18), although four of the five residents who scored zero on the MMSE failed to complete the GDS-short interview. There were also no significant differences on any of these characteristics between all residents who either dropped out of the study or could not complete an interview (n = 39 + 18 = 57) and all residents who did complete a GDS-short interview (n = 91). Participants in Site 2 were significantly older than participants in Site 1 (M = 90.3, SD = 6.7 versus M = 86.1, SD = 6.3, respectively; t(127) = −3.67, p < .001). There were no other characteristics that were significantly different between the two sites. Table 1  shows the comparisons between the GDS-short and MDS measures of mood for the two sites. The denominators in the cells of the table reflect the total number of residents available to calculate each percentage provided in  Table 1  . The denominators vary between rows on the basis of the percentage statistic being calculated. For example, as illustrated in row 1 of  Table 1  , 49% of the residents in Site 1 and 55% in Site 2 who were able and willing to complete the GDS interview (n = 33 and n = 58, respectively, as reflected in the denominators) scored higher than 5 on the GDS-short, which is indicative of probable depression. There was no significant difference between sites on either the average GDS-short total scores (M = 6.4, SD = 3.7 vs. M = 5.3, SD = 3.9, respectively; t(89) = 1.3, p = .19 or the proportion of residents who scored higher than 5 (χ2(N = 91) = .38, p = .54). There was also no significant difference between sites in the proportion of residents who had probable depression according to the GDS-short (i.e., total score >5) when only those residents who did not have a chart diagnosis of dementia were considered (41% vs. 58%, χ2(N = 53) = 1.36, p = .243). In addition, the proportions of residents within the retest subsample who scored above or below the cut-off value of 5 on the GDS-short interview was also highly stable with 39 (81%) residents receiving the same classification according to both assessments (26 scored >5 on both assessments; 13 scored ≤5 on both assessments). This comparison yielded a Kappa value of .60 (p < .001) which reflects good agreement between the two assessments. There was no significant difference between sites on test–retest agreement as determined by Kappa. The level of agreement continued to be significant despite a smaller sample when only those residents without a diagnosis of dementia were considered (Kappa = .48, p < .01). The correlation between the GDS-short total scores for the two assessments among the retest sample was .77 (p < .001). Table 1  , row 2 shows the number and percentage of residents in each NH who were rated by staff as having one or more (of a possible total of 16) symptoms of disturbed mood. There was a significant difference between NHs on this MDS mood measure; NH staff scored 34% of 38 participants in Site 1 and 72% of 71 participants in Site 2 as positive for a MDS mood symptom.  Table 1  , row 3, shows that NH staff in Site 2 also identified a higher proportion of residents with mood symptoms whom the research staff independently identified as expressing depression symptoms during the GDS-short interview as compared with Site 1 (78% vs. 25%, respectively; χ2 (N = 48) = 12.59, p < .001).Finally, the percentage within each of the two resident samples who would be identified as depressed on the basis of the depression QI calculation was significantly different and, in fact, reflected the differences in the depression QIs that were generated for the entire facility. Row 4 of  Table 1  shows that the QI estimates of depression prevalence were 3% and 19% in the two samples, as compared with 1% and 12%, respectively, for the entire population in each facility.In consideration of these findings, we conducted further analyses to clarify why NH staff in Site 1 detected less mood disturbance than NH staff in Site 2 as documented on the MDS. We first analyzed the number of residents in the two samples who were admitted to the NH with a diagnosis of depression on the premise that NH staff within each of the two homes might be differentially sensitized to disturbed mood symptoms based on this admission variable. We also conducted interviews with the MDS nurse at each site to determine the procedures used to complete the MDS items related to mood disturbance. We did not find differences between the NHs on either of these variables. The percentage of residents who were admitted to the NH with a diagnosis of depression in the two samples was not significantly different between sites (i.e., 28% in Site 1 and 31% in Site 2). Furthermore, both NHs employed an MDS nurse who did not have direct care responsibilities to complete the MDS. In both cases, these MDS nurses reported that they relied on direct care staff for information.Because, according to GDS-short interview data, NH staff were not identifying symptoms among a substantial number of residents (12 at Site 1 and 7 at Site 2), who scored >5 on the GDS-short, we hypothesized that NH staff may be identifying that subset of residents who were expressing more severe or more noticeable symptoms of depression. Thus, we compared GDS-short total scores for those participants correctly identified by NH staff as having symptoms of disturbed mood versus those who were not identified by NH staff (i.e., GDS-short total score >5 but no MDS-documented symptoms of disturbed mood). However, we found the GDS-short total scores to be comparable between these two groups (M = 8.6, SD = 2.0 vs. M = 9.0, SD = 2.5, respectively).To further assess which, if any, symptoms NH staff were more likely to document (i.e., notice) according to the MDS, we ran a frequency distribution of all sixteen mood items for the group of 109 participants for whom we had complete MDS information. This analysis showed the following symptoms to be documented most frequently among residents: (a) Item b, repetitive questions (n = 12); (b) Item c, repetitive verbalizations (n = 12); (c) Item d, persistent anger (n = 13); (d) Item h, repetitive health complaints (n = 11); (e) Item i, repetitive anxious nonhealth-related concerns (n = 11); (f) Item l, sad and/or pained facial expression (n = 40); (g) Item m, crying, tearfulness (n = 16); (h) Item n, repetitive physical movements (n = 16).Those symptoms less frequently documented among residents by NH staff included the following: (a) Item a, negative statements (n = 3); (b) Item e, self depreciation (n = 2); (c) Item f, expression of unrealistic fears (n = 6); (d) Item g, recurrent statements that something terrible is about to happen (n = 1); (e) Item j, unpleasant mood in the morning (n = 3); (f) Item k, insomnia and/or changes in sleep patterns (n = 6); (g) Item o, withdrawal from activities of interest (n = 4); and, (h) Item p, reduced social interaction (n = 7). Discussion This study provides preliminary evidence that the prevalence of depression as measured by NH staff-generated estimates (i.e., MDS data) may be more influenced by the ability of indigenous nursing staff to detect symptoms than by the actual prevalence rate. It is unclear how the prevalence of the depression QI derived from the MDS will be interpreted or evaluated by survey staff or providers, who currently represent the primary users of this information, but it is clear that Site 2 should not be regarded as having a more serious problem with depression outcomes than Site 1. In fact, the opposite conclusion seems more defensible. There is a greater likelihood that Site 1 should be targeted for an intervention project to improve their ability to detect mood symptoms that may be indicative of depression. The fact that Site 2 had mental health staff who were frequently on site suggests that NH staff at Site 2 who completed the MDS were made more aware of mood symptoms than the staff in Site 1 who did not have an on-site mental health service. The fact that depression symptoms are generally underdetected in long-term care because providers regard the symptoms as a normal part of aging has been described in other reports (Katz, Streim, and Parmelee 1994   ). These other reports, when considered in the context of the data reported in this article, suggest that training programs should be developed to improve depression symptom recognition among providers who do not have the unique advantage of having daily access to mental health professionals.The data reported in this article are limited by the fact that they were collected as part of an ongoing clinical trial that was not directly designed to evaluate factors that might differentiate NHs on either depression outcomes or on the processes that NH staff use to detect symptoms of depression among residents. In addition to sample size and data generalizability limitations created by the study design, other issues could also be raised about our methodology to assess depression.We have previously noted that there is some concern that the GDS-short has reduced sensitivity and specificity in detecting depression among individuals with dementia. No other standardized instrument, however, has been demonstrated to be a better depression screen, and there is expert consensus that the GDS-short should be used in the NH setting. Furthermore, the subsample of residents who completed two interviews in this study represented a range of cognitive impairment (i.e., those with and without a dementia diagnosis) and showed high reliability of both GDS total scores as well as classification as "probable depression" according to the GDS-short cut-off value of greater than 5. Finally, rates of probable depression on the basis of GDS-short interview results remained comparable between sites after controlling for dementia diagnoses.It is important to recognize that both the GDS-short and the MDS should be considered only as screens for depressive symptoms that warrant further follow-up evaluation (as outlined in the MDS-Resident Assessment Protocols) and not as accurate measurements of a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder. A good case can, thus, be made from our data that the two homes differ significantly in their ability to screen for depressive symptoms. This could indicate a potential problem at least among that subsample of residents who participated in the clinical trial because it is likely that lack of identification translates into lack of appropriate treatment for these residents. These results suggest that the MDS QI report used to compare homes on multiple indicators might often be more influenced by differential assessment sensitivity as opposed to differential outcomes in at least one important care area.

     Abstract Purpose of Study: To maximize respondent participation in a study of the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of dementia. Design and Methods: Clinical research nurses were trained to carry out evaluations for dementia in the home. We describe the assessment and training procedures used and note the advantages and drawbacks of this approach. Results: Nurse identification of the presence of dementia agreed well with that of medical specialists (kappa = 0.84), but was slightly poorer regarding type of dementia (kappa = 0.71). Implications: Use of nurses for such activity need not be limited to epidemiological studies, but is relevant also in clinical practice.   Diagnosis ,  Dementia ,  In-home evaluation Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDAlthough detailed assessments of progressive cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly are generally administered by highly trained medical or neuropsychological specialists, the relative scarcity and higher costs of such professionals often limit their participation in major population studies. The present report describes our experiences in substituting trained clinical research nurses to administer a detailed neuropsychological and clinical evaluation for dementia in the homes of participants enrolled in a major epidemiological study of dementia. Such experience can be expected to be of relevance also to clinical investigators and medical care providers.In 1986 the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), with funding from the National Institute on Aging, began to develop a standardized assessment for the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease in tertiary care clinics. This assessment has since been used in epidemiological surveys of dementia (e.g., Fillenbaum et al. 1998   ; Ganguli et al. 1996   ; Ganguli, Ratcliff, and Dekosky 1997   ; Hendrie et al. 1995   ). The two basic assessments used for evaluating dementia consist of the CERAD Neuropsychological Battery, which is designed to determine the type and severity of cognitive impairment, and the CERAD Clinical Battery, which assesses presence, type, and severity of dementia (Morris et al. 1989   ; Welsh, Butters, Hughes, Mohs, and Heyman 1991   ). Trained clinical research nurses administered both of these batteries and carried out independently a standardized, valid, and reliable assessment of dementia in the home.Unlike the sterility of a clinic, in-home assessment may validate or correct reports of the participant's abilities. Erroneous descriptions of an individual's abilities may occur because of ignorance or fear of nursing home placement. For example, in a telephone interview, a daughter denied that her elderly mother, who lived next door, had memory loss or functional decline. During the home assessment, however, the mother was disoriented and unable to recall her address. She was able to live independently only because her grandchildren came in daily at specific times to remind her to take her medicine, to assist her in getting dressed, and to prepare meals.Or consider another example. A niece reported that her uncle had a definite memory problem and could not maintain his appearance or manage his bills. If seen at the clinic, he would have appeared disheveled with a stained shirt and buttons askew. His hearing loss, cataracts, and illiteracy would impair performance on standard neuropsychology measures, and his appearance would raise concern about his ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). However, unable to find transportation for the 1-hour trip to the assessment clinic, he was seen at home. He looked unkempt, but he maintained an immaculate home. He described accurately the dosage time and indication for each of his six medications set out neatly on his table. He rode the bus to the senior center for lunch daily, remembering pick-up times and bus numbers. In fact, without a clothes washer and with only 1 year of education, he depended on his niece to pick up his laundry and pay his bills.In this article, we describe the cognitive and clinical assessment batteries used, the training provided to the nurses, and the extent to which the nurses' diagnoses of dementia agreed with that of medical specialists. CERAD Neuropsychological and Clinical Batteries The Neuropsychological Battery used in this study consists of seven brief assessments that measure the areas of cognitive functioning usually implicated in Alzheimer's disease. These assessments are outlined in  Table 1  . The entire battery takes 20–30 min to administer, depending on sensory deficits.The Clinical Battery includes a detailed standardized inquiry with an informant to determine changes in the respondent's cognitive performance particularly with respect to the six areas listed in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Morris 1993   ): memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community, home and hobbies, and ADLs. Information on possible changes in behavior and personality are also sought. Depression was assessed by direct inquiry of the participant using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (Radloff 1977   ). Information was also obtained on instrumental and basic ADLs (Blessed, Tomlinson, and Roth 1968   ); verbal ability; calculation; orientation, memory, and concentration (Katzman et al. 1983   ); and the CERAD Clock Drawing Test (rated on a 4-point scale). The CERAD Clock Drawing Test assesses spatial orientation, dysphasia for numbers, and aspects of executive functioning. The nurse evaluators performed abbreviated physical and neurological examinations and reviewed medications to detect comorbidities, acute conditions, or drug effects likely to affect cognitive and physical function and behavior. In the present study, we notified primary providers of physical findings and medication problems of clinical concern.The final section of the Clinical Battery provides algorithms, using information obtained earlier, to determine whether cognitive impairment was present, and if so, whether criteria for dementia have been met. In the latter case, the type of dementia that seems to be present is identified. In addition to the algorithms, which operationalize the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, criteria for dementia (American Psychiatric Association 1994   ), and modified National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (McKhann et al. 1984   ), we asked the nurse to give a professional opinion as to the diagnosis and a CDR score. In doing so, the nurse integrated the information gathered on environmental, social and socio-economic factors, life history, and family involvement to develop a participant profile from a holistic nursing perspective. This information clarified the clinical relevance of the neuropsychological and functional performance scores, making a unique contribution. Establishing Proficiency in the CERAD Neuropsychological Battery We described the measures and administered them to the trainee nurses, who also viewed a video training tape. The nurses then administered the battery to several elderly friends. The project director (GGF) reviewed these completed batteries and discussed possible difficulties in administration and scoring. The nurses then administered the entire battery to the project director and scored it in her presence. After this latter step had been successfully completed, the project director permitted the nurses to administer this battery in the field. To ensure continued uniformity throughout the duration of the study, we continued to check each administration for completeness and accuracy of scoring. Establishing Proficiency in the CERAD Clinical Battery We established proficiency through the Geriatric Evaluation and Treatment Clinic at Duke University Medical Center. The nurses first observed evaluations carried out by the medical director before performing evaluations under his guidance. After they became competent, they made home visits with an experienced clinical research nurse or geriatrician. After the nurses observed evaluations, the supervisor permitted them to carry out their own examination under supervision until the supervisor deemed them competent. Time to Proficiency Each of the nurses, who at minimum had a bachelor's degree, had over 8 years of geriatric and nursing care experience and had worked in a research setting. With staff at this level, and a very focused program, it is possible to attain proficiency within 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the schedule of clinic precepting, familiarity with the assessment tools, and the availability of participants. Recording Clinical Data The CERAD Clinical Battery has been programmed for laptop use. The program automatically presents the interviewer with the next appropriate question. It sums scales, eliminating computation errors. Previously obtained information needed later in the interview appears at the appropriate time. Training in use of the laptop and the data entry system included experience entering hard copy forms and using the system during mock interviews. We have found the laptops are an "ice breaker," rather than a barrier to the encounter in the home. Participant Contact, Additional Information Sought, Diagnostic Determination Nurse evaluators telephoned participants or their caregivers beforehand, explained the study, and sought initial agreement. The nurses arranged a convenient time for the interview (and confirmed the evening before or the morning of the interview), and obtained directions to the residence. In the home, the nurses explained the study again. The participant read and signed the consent form, and the participant or caregiver received a copy. Where participants were wards of the court (true for some persons in institutions), the nurses obtained permission from the court-appointed guardian. The nurses administered the CERAD Neuropsychological Battery first, while the participant and interviewer were fresh. The brief physical and neurological examination followed, and then the rest of the CERAD Clinical Battery. The total interview required 90 to 120 min, depending on the level of competence of the participant, sensory deficits present, and environmental conditions.On return to the office, the nurse evaluators checked materials for completeness. The nurses conducted telephone interviews with informants, if the informants were not seen earlier, and requested medical records for the past 5 years (relevant to the assessment of dementia). We have received 95% of the medical records requested. The nurse evaluators reviewed the records for information that might indicate the presence of dementia, including behavioral abnormalities. Working as a member of the consensus diagnosis team, the nurse then collated, summarized and presented the information gathered at a diagnosis consensus meeting attended by at least one geriatrician and one senior neurologist. Table 2  indicates the diagnostic agreement, in gross categories, between the nurse evaluators and the diagnosis consensus committee for 105 participants with first study evaluations from 1997 to 1999. None of these participants was considered clearly normal. If we assume the diagnosis consensus committee to be correct, the nurses' diagnosis was in agreement for 92.9% of those participants classified as normal, 70.0% of those participants who were cognitively impaired, and 96.5% of those participants who were demented. Agreement across the three categories was 90.5% (kappa = 0.84). Agreement on specific diagnosis was 86.5% for Alzheimer's disease, 85.7% for vascular dementia, and 66.7% for other dementing disorders (kappa = 0.71;  Table 3  ). According to generally accepted criteria, these values represent excellent and good agreement, respectively (Landis and Koch 1977   ). Comparison With Other Studies The few studies that have reported on the use of nurses for evaluation of dementia in the clinic or in the home have consistently indicated that nurses, using structured, and in some cases purpose-designed instruments, are able to make a diagnosis of dementia accurately (Dennis, Furness, Lindesay, and Wright 1998   ; Seymour, Saunders, Wattis, and Daly 1994   ; Sjobeck and Isacsson 1995   ). In these studies, kappa values (agreement beyond chance) range from 0.70–0.79 for agreement with specialists. This is comparable to the level of agreement found in the present study. As has also been found among medical specialists, there is less agreement on the type of dementia.Unlike previous studies, the nurses in the present one were also involved in recruitment. This, as Wrobel and Shapiro 1999    indicated, is an onerous task, but one which yields a higher recruitment and retention rate than expecting patients or participants to come to the investigator. Prior to using in-home evaluation, participants severely resisted coming to Duke University Medical Center for evaluation because of distance, problems with transportation, loss of a day's earnings for a family member, or the participant's health. These are the same reasons that have led others to in-home evaluation. Those who declined our invitation to come to the medical center nevertheless welcomed the initial and annual in-home evaluations. Home visits also provided more accurate estimations of coping ability in the usual environment and allowed follow up in the nursing home. As with other studies that have used this approach, there are disadvantages also: a) inability to control the testing environment, b) conditions adverse to testing in the home, c) lack of ability to perform neuroimaging, and d) potential (if rare) danger to study staff.Although our focus has been on the use of clinical research nurses in epidemiological surveys, others, as indicated, have found such professionals valuable in the clinic setting. The CERAD battery was developed in such a setting, and training tapes of both clinical and neuropsychological administration are available. As a multisite study, CERAD developed certification procedures on the basis of audiotapes of interviews with patients (with miniature camcorders, videotaping is now less intrusive and feasible) and a review of hard copy forms. CERAD conducted continued monitoring by spot checking randomly selected forms. The current study suggests that, with such procedures in place, carefully selected, CERAD-certified nurses could independently carry out assessments for the most common types of dementia either in the clinic or at home. Input from specialists would be desirable where the nurse is unsure of the diagnosis (typically the less common dementing disorders). Such an approach could result in a uniformity of diagnosis of dementia across sites that is not currently assured and facilitate follow up of patients with dementia.In summary, we have found that it is eminently feasible to train clinical research nurses to make accurate diagnoses of dementia in the home. In-home evaluation, however, limits certain kinds of information that can be obtained (e.g., reduces the feasibility of neuroimaging studies), and the evaluation must sometimes be conducted under less than ideal environmental conditions (e.g., excessive noise, poor climate control, interruptions). Nevertheless, the participation rate is likely to be enhanced, because the subject need not move from a familiar environment and travel to an unfamiliar one. Once having been seen by the nurses, the participant is likely to remain a study participant, thus increasing retention rates.  None  Table 1.   None  View Large Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of Kevorkian euthanasia cases were compared with Oregon physician-assisted suicide (PAS) cases and U.S. mortality data. Design and Methods: Two hundred variables were coded from medical examiner reports on all 69 Kevorkian euthanasia cases who died and were autopsied by the Oakland County Medical Examiner. Data on the 43 Oregon PAS cases in the first two years and U.S. mortality data were obtained from published sources. Results: Only 25% of patients euthanized by Kevorkian were terminally ill as compared to 100% of Oregon PAS cases. PAS cases were significantly more likely to have cancer (72%) than euthanasia cases (29%). Women and those who were divorced or had never married were significantly more likely to seek euthanasia than would have been predicted by national mortality statistics. Implications: Gender and marital status appeared to influence decisions to seek an assisted death, and research on the role of these factors in end-of-life decision making is merited.   Death and dying ,  End-of-life decision making ,  Physician-assisted suicide ,  Euthanasia Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhD.Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) continue to be controversial issues. Attitude surveys of physicians as well as patient and community populations have confirmed the diverse perceptions and beliefs about the acceptability and morality of PAS and euthanasia (Bachman et al. 1996   ; Blendon, Szalay, and Knox 1992   ; Breitbart, Rosenfeld, and Passik 1996   ; Brown, Henteleff, Barakat, and Rowe 1986   ; Chochinov et al. 1995   ; Cohen, Fihn, Boyko, Jonsen, and Wood 1994   ; Duberstein, Conwell, Cox, Podgorski, Glazer, and Caine 1995   ; Emanuel, Fairclough, Daniels, and Clarridge 1995   ; Fried, Stein, O'Sullivan, Brock, and Novack 1993   ; Ganzini, Johnston, McFarland, Tolle, and Lee 1998   ; Lee et al. 1996   ; Seidlitz, Duberstein, Cox, and Conwell 1995   ; Shapiro, Derse, Gottlieb, Schiedermayer, and Olson 1994   ). There are many complex concerns, ranging from the individual's ethical right to choose when to die to the appropriateness and availability of safeguards to protect vulnerable populations.Empirical data about the circumstances and characteristics of patients who successfully sought PAS and euthanasia as well as physician practices in these situations have been difficult to ascertain in the United States due to the illegal status of these acts in all states except Oregon. Oregon legalized PAS in 1997, allowing terminally ill patients who meet certain criteria to receive lethal prescriptions from physicians for the purpose of ending their lives. Euthanasia, or assisting the suicide of another person through other means, such as a lethal injection, is illegal in all 50 states. Although sometimes used interchangeably, the terms euthanasia and PAS describe distinctly different types of assisted deaths. As legally defined in Oregon, PAS refers to a death caused by ingesting a lethal dose of medication obtained by prescription from a physician for the purpose of ending one's life. In contrast, euthanasia refers to deaths that occur as a result of more direct intervention.At least three major U.S. studies that relied upon voluntary physician reports have begun to identify the characteristics of patients who wanted to die as well as physicians who responded to their requests (Back, Wallace, Starks, and Pearlman 1996   ; Emanuel et al. 1999   ; Meier et al. 1998   ).Back and associates 1996    sent questionnaires to 1,453 primary care and subspeciality physicians; of the 828 responding physicians, 12% reported explicit requests to help patients die. Subsequent interviews led to 207 case descriptions of patients who were given a lethal prescription or lethal injection. More than half of these patients were men over age 65 who had been under the care of their physicians for more than a year. Most were expected to live less than 6 months, which is the standard medical definition for terminal illness, and 73% were diagnosed with either cancer or HIV/AIDS. Patients who requested lethal injections rather than lethal prescriptions were in severe pain or physical discomfort, dependent on others for personal care, or confined to bed. Emanuel and colleagues 1999    surveyed 355 oncologists, of whom 56 reported participating in PAS. Of the 38 case descriptions provided, more than half were women, all were expected to live less than 6 months, and 97% could not perform self-care or had unremitting pain despite narcotic analgesia.Finally, Meier and associates 1998    mailed questionnaires to 3,102 physicians in 10 specialties; of the 1,902 who returned questionnaires, a total of 81 cases of assisted death were identified. Of the 38 patients given a lethal prescription, almost all were men expected to live less than 6 months. More than half were in severe pain, 70% had cancer as a primary diagnosis, and 19% were depressed. Of the 43 patients who received a lethal injection, more than half were men and nearly all were expected to live less than 6 months; 23% had cancer and 16% had AIDS.Results from the first 2 years of experience with legalized PAS in Oregon have provided a limited sociodemographic profile of these patients (Chin, Hedberg, Higginson, and Fleming 1999   ; Sullivan, Hedberg, and Fleming 2000   ). Of 43 patients who died after ingesting a lethal dose of medication obtained with a legal prescription, half were men, cancer was the predominant diagnosis, and all had been certified as terminally ill and free from depression or other factors that would compromise decision making.The purpose of this study was to identify and clarify the characteristics of another known group who sought assistance in ending their lives: persons whose deaths were assisted illegally by Dr. Jack Kevorkian in Oakland County, Michigan. The deaths assisted by Kevorkian were classified as euthanasia, as these men and women died either from carbon monoxide poisoning or from the intravenous administration of lethal drugs; Kevorkian's last patient died from a lethal injection. Thus, throughout this study, euthanasia refers to deaths caused by the direct intervention of others, specifically deaths assisted by Jack Kevorkian. PAS refers to deaths in which physicians prescribed lethal doses of medication in keeping with legal statutes in Oregon.Kevorkian's behavior in assisting patients' deaths is not comparable to the standards of U.S. physician practices, and the individuals euthanized lacked the protection of clinical safeguards such as those in place in Oregon. However, an analysis of the Kevorkian cases is valuable to identify persons who are vulnerable to seeking euthanasia and physician assistance in dying. Unlike the previous U.S. studies relying on voluntary physician selection, recollection, and reporting, or the limited clinical descriptions of patients in Oregon, extensive data on the clinical and psychosocial characteristics of Kevorkian's patients are available from medical examiner investigative reports. Although many of these cases have been reviewed for legal and political purposes (Anstett et al. 1997   ), this is the first descriptive clinical analysis. A brief summary of the characteristics of the Kevorkian cases was reported in a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (Roscoe, Malphurs, Dragovic, and Cohen 2000   ).PAS and euthanasia remain controversial issues, and it is not the intent of the authors or the purpose of this study to justify the inclusion of assistance in dying as an end-of-life choice, nor to vilify or canonize Jack Kevorkian. Rather, our goal is to identify and clarify the characteristics of persons for whom assisted death was the selected option in the hope of expanding our knowledge to improve end-of-life care. The specific aims of this study were: (1) to analyze the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of Kevorkian euthanasia cases who died and were investigated in Oakland County, Michigan, from 1990 to 1998; (2) to compare the characteristics of the Kevorkian cases to patients who died in Oregon as a result of a lethal prescription; and (3) to examine risk factors for death by euthanasia relative to national mortality statistics for persons who died in the United States in 1997, the last year data were available. Methods Sample Euthanasia cases were all 69 persons whose deaths were assisted by Jack Kevorkian in Oakland County, Michigan, between 1990 and 1998. Persons who died with Kevorkian's assistance but were autopsied outside Oakland County were excluded from the analysis to minimize reporting bias, because the uniform procedures and protocols used by the Oakland County medical examiner were not standardized across other medical examiner districts. Data on the 43 individuals who died in Oregon in 1998–1999 as a result of legal drug overdoses were obtained from published summary data based on physician reports as required by Oregon law (Chin et al. 1999   ; Sullivan et al. 2000   ). No post-mortem data are available for the Oregon cases, because autopsies are not required. U.S. mortality data were also obtained from published sources (Hoyert, Kochanek, and Murphy 1999   ). Data Collection Data on the Kevorkian euthanasia cases were abstracted and coded from medical examiner files, which included investigative reports, autopsy findings, toxicology results, death certificates, medical records, letters from physicians, police records, and, where available, court proceedings and transcripts of interviews with family members. The data coding and collection methodology was adapted from the U.S. Air Force autopsy protocol modified by Cohen and associates to study suicide and homicide–suicide in older men and women (Cohen, Llorente, and Eisdorfer 1998   ). A total of 203 variables in seven domains were coded: 10 variables describing data sources; 10 incident identification variables; 6 sociodemographic variables; 32 variables describing physical circumstances; 44 antecedent conditions; 25 drug categories from toxicology studies; and 76 other autopsy findings, including International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Two authors independently coded the information from each medical examiner file using a manual of operational definitions; they compared results, and in cases where a discrepancy existed, a consensus was determined. Data Analysis Demographic characteristics, antecedent conditions, and autopsy findings of the 69 Kevorkian cases were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Chi-square analyses using Fisher's Exact Test were conducted on categorical variables, and independent t tests were calculated for continuous variables. Bonferroni corrections were calculated in the two domains (marital status and underlying disease) in which multiple comparisons were made.Demographic characteristics of the Kevorkian euthanasia cases were compared to U.S. mortality statistics for 1997, the most recent year for which data are available (Hoyert et al. 1999   ). The rate of euthanasia per 100,000 deaths was calculated by race, sex, and marital status. Risk ratios were calculated, with White, Male, and Married used as reference categories. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each risk ratio, and p values were determined for each CI. Results Description of Kevorkian Euthanasia Cases The characteristics of the euthanasia cases are presented in  Table 1  . Forty-nine (72%) of the 69 Kevorkian euthanasia cases were women, and most were non-Hispanic Whites who lived at home at the time of death. Male and female euthanasia cases were similar except for marital status. Approximately one third of women (31%) and 40% of men were married when they died, but a significantly higher percentage of women were divorced (43% of women compared to 15% of men). Men were significantly more likely to have never married (40% of men compared to 10% of women); the statistical significance of this finding was upheld after correcting for multiple comparisons.A total of 96% of all euthanasia cases had a history of physical illness confirmed at autopsy, and the remaining 4% had a history of psychiatric problems. However, only 25% of all cases were determined to be terminally ill (i.e., expected to live less than 6 months) by the medical examiner at autopsy. A decline in health status (operationally defined as a recent event such as the onset of a new symptom, recommendation to have surgery or other invasive procedure, or metastasis of cancer) prior to the time of death was reported for 76% of the women and 65% of the men. In 5 (7%) of the 69 cases (4 women and 1 man) the medical examiner found no anatomical evidence of disease at autopsy. These individuals were reported to suffer from conditions such as chronic diffuse pain with no identifiable physical cause, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression or other psychiatric problems as documented in medical records and investigative reports. Fewer than 15% of women and men were reported to have had clinically significant depressive symptoms at the time of death. Women were twice as likely as men to have talked about suicide prior to dying, but fewer than 10% of both men and women had attempted suicide in the past.Approximately one third of men and women had a neurological disease confirmed at autopsy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was confirmed in 10 women and 2 men; multiple sclerosis (MS) was confirmed in 9 women and 5 men. Two individuals had Parkinson's disease, and two cases of dementia were confirmed at autopsy. Cancer diagnoses accounted for 27% of women and 35% of men. Lung, ovarian, and breast cancer comprised 85% of cancers in women; in men, cancers were evenly distributed across a range of primary sites. Only 4% of women and none of the men indicated that they wanted to die to avoid being a burden to their families.Toxicology studies revealed that 42% of all cases were positive for analgesics at the time of death, and one third (34%) were cancer patients. Nearly half (43%) were positive for benzodiazepenes, and of these 27% had either ALS or MS, 20% had terminal cancer, and 10% were being treated for anxiety disorders. Only 6% of women and 5% of men were positive for antidepressants. Toxicity results were negative for alcohol, antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs or other cardiovascular drugs, diuretics, and hypoglycemic medications. Comparison of PAS and Euthanasia Cases A total of 43 persons died by PAS in Oregon in 1998 (Chin et al. 1999   ) and 1999 (Sullivan et al. 2000   ). As shown in  Table 2  , their median age was 70 years and almost all were White. One third were married when they died, 30% were divorced, 26% were widowed, and 12% had never married. Most patients had cancer, with lung cancer being the most prevalent; the others had AIDS or end-stage heart or lung disease. All had been certified by at least two physicians as meeting the statutory definition for terminal illness (i.e., expected to live less than 6 months). The majority of patients (76%) were enrolled in hospice at the time of death as compared to only 2 of the 69 Kevorkian cases. Oregon statute requires that individuals who request a lethal prescription be advised of alternatives to PAS, such as hospice.The median age of the Kevorkian euthanasia cases was 12 years younger than the Oregon PAS cases, and they were significantly less likely to have cancer, a finding whose significance held after Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons of underlying illnesses ( Table 2  ). More than one third of the euthanasia cases but only 9% of the Oregon cases had a neurological disorder (ALS or MS). Depressive disorders or depressive symptoms were reported in 13% of the euthanasia cases; Oregon statute requires that individuals seeking PAS be certified by a physician as having no clinically significant depressive symptoms that may influence decision making. Risk Factors for Euthanasia and Legalized PAS It is impossible to draw a random sample of euthanasia cases from which to generalize, because providing such direct assistance in dying is both illegal and against physicians' ethical codes of conduct. Thus, in an attempt to estimate population parameters from the convenience sample of Kevorkian euthanasia cases, individuals who died with Kevorkian's assistance were compared with other U.S. residents who died in 1997, the last year for which data were available (Hoyert et al. 1999   ). Nationwide mortality statistics were used because although those individuals who died with Kevorkian's assistance all died in Michigan, less than a quarter (23%) were Michigan residents; they had lived in 24 different states.Euthanasia cases differed by race, sex, and marital status from the U.S. population (see  Table 3  ). Euthanasia cases were significantly more likely to be White, female, divorced or never married, and they were less likely to be widowed. The risk ratio for non-White as compared to White persons was 0.3 CI = 0.1–0.9, p < .05). The risk ratio for women as compared to men was 2.4 (CI = 1.4–4.1, p < .001). Compared to persons who were married, those who were divorced were 4.3 times more likely to choose euthanasia (CI = 2.5–7.7, p < .001). Persons who had never married were 2.3 times more likely to choose euthanasia than married persons (CI = 1.2–4.6, p < .01). Persons who were widowed at the time of death were less likely to choose euthanasia (relative risk [RR] = 0.4, CI = 0.2–0.9, p < .025).In the first year of legal assisted suicide in Oregon, those who were divorced or never married were more likely than married persons to choose PAS (divorced persons, RR = 6.8, CI = 1.3–37.2, p = .03; never married, RR = 23.7, CI = 4.4–128.9, p < .001). Persons who died from ingesting lethal prescriptions (PAS) did not differ by race or sex from Oregon residents who died from similar diseases, primarily cancer (Chin et al. 1999   ). Data from the second year of legal PAS revealed that only those with college educations were at increased risk for PAS relative to other Oregon residents (Sullivan et al. 2000   ). Discussion The results of our analyses revealed: (1) the vulnerability of persons who were not terminally ill to seek Kevorkian for euthanasia, unchecked by clinical safeguards; (2) the high representation of women who chose euthanasia; and (3) the greater likelihood of persons who were divorced or never married to seek an assisted death, a pattern evident in both the Kevorkian euthanasia and first-year (1998) PAS cases. Terminal Illness Discussions about PAS and euthanasia typically assume that patients are near death, yet only one quarter of persons who sought Kevorkian for euthanasia were terminally ill when they died. Nearly all of the Kevorkian euthanasia cases had serious physical illnesses that in some cases may have been compounded by depressive symptoms or other psychiatric illnesses. In addition, nearly three quarters had experienced a recent decline in health status. The actual or perceived inability to cope with illness may also have impacted the decision to seek assistance in dying. When such patients run out of options for treatment, yet fall outside the usual 6 months of life requirement for hospice care, their desperation may lead them to consider an assisted death instead of other options, including palliative care and mental health services.The vulnerability of Kevorkian's euthanasia cases is in stark contrast to the PAS cases in Oregon. The Oregon experience with an articulated standard for legalized PAS assures that terminally ill, competent individuals make the decision to obtain a lethal prescription after being informed of available alternatives such as palliative care and pain management. Only two of the Kevorkian cases were under the care of hospice at the time of death. Because the majority of Kevorkian's euthanasia cases had prognoses longer than 6 months, which would usually exclude them from hospice eligibility, it is even less likely that these patients received adequate information about palliative care as an alternative to assistance in dying. In particular, a sense of urgency about impending disability and narrowing future options may have motivated the patients with neurodegenerative diseases to seek help from Kevorkian before they were considered terminally ill by medical criteria (Ganzini et al. 1998   ).Patients in Oregon who seek a lethal prescription have to be certified by two physicians as free from depressive symptoms or other conditions that might affect their ability to make health care decisions. Kevorkian's patients included individuals compromised by depressive symptoms, undertreated pain, and dementia. The small but troubling number of cases in which no anatomical evidence of disease was found at autopsy also highlights the significance of pain and psychiatric issues in the desire to die and the motivation to seek assistance in dying. The lack of anatomical evidence of disease may underestimate the suffering and desperation of these patients.As legalizing PAS continues to be considered in state legislatures, we need to know more about the motivations and antecedent factors that precipitate a decision to die. Alternatives such as aggressive pain and symptom management and treatment for psychological distress need to be more widely available so that, if legal, PAS represents a choice, not the only alternative to suffering. While patients near death deserve better options for end-of-life care that include their preferences and values, opportunities are missed to address the needs of patients with longer prognoses (and sometimes fewer options) in our efforts to provide better care for the dying. Gender The high representation of women among euthanasia cases is disturbing, given what is known about the Oregon PAS experience, U.S. mortality data, and the low suicide rate in women. Men and women were almost equally represented in the Oregon cases, but women were 2.5 times more likely to seek Kevorkian for euthanasia than men. The factors that made women, particularly older women, more vulnerable to euthanasia are difficult to discern from the available data.Differing experiences with medical care may influence the ways in which women approach medical decisions, including decisions to seek assistance in dying. Disparate treatment in cardiac care has been demonstrated, (Ayanian and Epstein 1991   ; Giles, Anda, Casper, Escobedo, and Taylor 1995   ; Schulman et al. 1999   ; Steingart, et al. 1991   ) as well as the greater risk for women to have inadequate pain control (Cleeland et al. 1994   ). Women are patients more often than men, have more contacts with physicians, and more frequently make decisions about when others should seek medical care (Benson and Marano 1993   ; Horton 1992   ; Thomas and Kelman 1990   ). Recent research has begun to target the shortfall in knowledge about women's health, disability, and help-seeking behavior that may also be helpful for understanding gender differences in end-of-life decision making (Hu et al. 1997   , Hu et al. 1999   ; Legato 1998   ; Legato, Padus, and Slaughter 1997   ; Michels et al. 1998   ; Rexrode et al. 1998   ; Willett et al. 1996   ).The availability of a caregiver may also differentially affect the end-of-life decisions made by men and women. Women provide most of the care that is given to dying patients, although women who need care tend to receive less assistance from family members than men, and are more likely to have to pay for assistance even if married (Emanuel et al. 1999   ). Wives are only one third as likely as husbands to report their spouses as caregivers (Allen, Goldscheider, and Ciambrone 1999   ). Marital Status Marital status was a significant risk factor for PAS cases in Oregon in the first year after the practice was legalized, as well as for Kevorkian euthanasia cases. Those who were divorced or had never been married were significantly more likely to seek an assisted death than those who were married. These results suggest the need to understand more about the family and psychosocial context of medical care decision making in general, and end-of-life decision making specifically. Medical decision making places considerable demands on patients and families to assess the risks and benefits of treatment as well as to make decisions that may result in the death of the patient. The decision-making process brings family dynamics such as guilt, conflict, ambiguity, and uncertainty to the surface, all of which must be dealt with in the clinical context as family members act as surrogate decision-makers or advisers to dying relatives.Medical care decision making about end-stage or terminal illness may differ for patients who are alone. The primary vulnerability of women and certain groups of men (i.e., those who are alone and coping with the burden of serious illness) requires clinical attention and should be the focus of additional research. The adequacy of psychosocial support networks should be considered in persons with long-standing chronic, end-stage, or terminal illnesses. Limitations This study has several limitations. Interpretation of our results is limited by biases in the data sources that were collected for other purposes (i.e., law enforcement investigations in Oakland County, Michigan, and compliance with statutory regulations in Oregon). Autopsy data are an excellent source for detailed anatomical and toxicology information for the Kevorkian euthanasia cases, but they do not allow for an evaluation of other relevant factors, such as an evaluation of mental illness. Variables such as psychiatric status, family structure, and other psychosocial factors outside the autopsy examination had to be constructed from medical examiner records. As mentioned previously, autopsies are not required of individuals who die from legalized PAS in Oregon; published summary data based on mandatory physician reporting provided the data on these cases.These infrequent and often concealed deaths due to PAS and euthanasia yield a small sample of cases that limits our ability to generalize. Both the Kevor-kian euthanasia cases and the Oregon PAS cases may not be representative of the majority of individuals who may want assistance in ending their lives. Further, the mortality comparisons used to estimate population parameters must be interpreted carefully. Although it would be more precise to select mortality statistics that matched the underlying diseases of the Kevorkian cases, the small samples that would result precluded this approach. However, the broader mortality comparisons did suggest some overall trends and demographic patterns that suggest risk factors in the population.From available data sources, assisted death appears to be an end-of-life choice almost exclusively for White men and women. Studies of attitudes about preferences for end-of-life care tend to show that Whites are more likely to indicate that they would forego life-sustaining treatment and more favorably inclined to advance directives than African Americans (Caralis, Davis, Wright, and Marcial 1993   ; Garrett, Harris, Norburn, Patrick, and Danis 1993   ). The racial bias in the sample raises questions about end-of-life choices in minority populations that could not be addressed in this study.The implications of our results for understanding end-of-life decisions are important despite the small numbers of persons available for study and the potential biases in the data sets from Michigan and Oregon. While efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on individuals who are in pain and suffering from depression near the point of death, the results of our analyses suggest that further improvements may be realized by including better care options for patients with longer prognoses who are struggling with the burdens of the chronic illnesses that will eventually cause their deaths. The descriptive analysis of the Kevorkian euthanasia cases and the emerging data from Oregon on PAS also present an index of concern to researchers and clinicians about the possible vulnerability of women and those who are not married at the end of life. Continued research on the role of gender and marital status in end-of-life care is merited.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: We examined the effects of communication skills training and the use of memory books by certified nursing assistants (CNAs) on verbal interactions between CNAs (n = 64) and nursing home residents (n = 67) during care routines. Design and Methods: CNAs were taught to use communication skills and memory books during their interactions with residents with moderate cognitive impairments and intact communication abilities. A staff motivational system was used to encourage performance and maintenance of these skills. Formal measures of treatment implementation were included. Results:Results were compared with those for participants on no-treatment control units. Trained CNAs talked more, used positive statements more frequently, and tended to increase the number of specific instructions given to residents. Changes in staff behavior did not result in an increase in total time giving care to residents. Maintenance of CNA behavior change was found 2 months after research staff exited the facility. Although an increase was found in positive verbal interactions between CNAs and residents on intervention units, other changes in resident communication were absent. Implications: Nursing staff can be trained to improve and maintain communication skills during care without increasing the amount of time delivering care. The methodological advantages of including measures to assess treatment implementation are discussed.   Long-term care ,  Staff training ,  Dementia Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe social milieu of the nursing home is a critical component of both quality of care and quality of life in this setting. In recent years, researchers have focused their efforts on understanding and improving various aspects of staff–resident and resident–resident social interactions. Direct behavioral observation of residents on a psychogeriatric ward revealed that 21% of residents' time was spent in physical care interactions (Hallberg, Norberg, and Eriksson 1990   ). Observation of certified nursing assistants' (CNAs') work behavior in nursing homes revealed that 53% of observation time was spent in a broader category of resident care, with 11.8% of observation time engaged in staff–resident verbal interaction (Burgio, Engel, Hawkins, McCormick, and Scheve 1990   ). Sadly, positive verbal interactions appear to be as rare as negative verbal interactions in nursing homes (Burgio et al. 1990   ), where neutral interactions appear to be the norm (Carstensen, Fisher, and Malloy 1995   ). These data suggest that intervention is necessary to structure staff–resident social interactions during care to positively affect resident quality of life.Communication-based interventions in nursing homes have the potential to improve resident behavioral deficits such as excess disability, low-rate social engagement, and behavioral excesses such as disruptive vocalization (Allen-Burge, Stevens, and Burgio 1999   ; Burgio and Stevens 1999   ). Through these interventions, staff are taught therapeutic strategies for approaching residents and responding to both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Recent small-sample studies of communication-based staff-training interventions to reduce resident problem behaviors have suggested that training staff to communicate more effectively might reduce the incidence of physical aggression (Boehm, Whall, Cosgrove, Locke, and Schlenk 1995   ; Hoeffner, Radar, McKenzie, Lavelle, and Stewart 1997   ).Many recent studies have used packaged staff interventions that include both communication skills training and the use of prosthetic memory aids, such as memory books, to compensate for residents' diminished cognitive capacity. Memory books contain images and brief, simple sentences that use the preserved automatic processing abilities of frail older adults to improve the structure and quality of communication with others, hopefully making interactions more pleasant for both older individuals and their partners in communication (Bourgeois 1990   , Bourgeois 1992a   , Bourgeois 1992b   , Bourgeois 1993   ; Bourgeois and Mason 1996   ).Memory books can serve two functions. First, they can provide meaningful stimulation to nursing home residents in an environment that can be both physically and socially barren. Second, they can be used as a tool by staff or other residents to facilitate communication with cognitively impaired residents. Through the use of memory books, community-residing dementia patients with a wide range of cognitive deficits have increased the informativeness and accuracy of their conversations and decreased their ambiguity and repetitiveness (Bourgeois 1990   , Bourgeois 1992a   , Bourgeois 1992b   ; Bourgeois and Mason 1996   ). Use of these aids has decreased disruptive verbal behaviors such as repetitive questioning (Bourgeois, Burgio, Schulz, Beach, and Palmer 1997   ). In nursing homes, content analysis of researcher-initiated, semistructured 5-min conversational interactions between demented residents and their primary CNAs, and social validity ratings of these interactions by unfamiliar judges, revealed modest improvements in resident and CNA conversational behaviors (Hoerster, Hickey, and Bourgeois in press   ).Ripich, Wykle, and Niles 1995    developed and tested a didactic training program for improving communication between CNAs and residents. In addition to teaching specific verbal and nonverbal communication strategies, training modules included information on language difficulties associated with different stages of dementia, depression, and cultural–ethnic considerations. Results showed that training improved both CNA knowledge and attitudes toward residents with dementia.McCallion, Toseland, Lacey, and Banks 1999    evaluated a Nursing Assistant Communication Skills Program on various staff and resident outcomes in nursing homes. In addition to teaching verbal and nonverbal communication skills, staff were taught to use memory aids. Memory aids included placing written and graphic signs in important locations and the use of memory charts placed on resident bedroom walls. Memory charts contained photographs, brief statements, and conversation topics that were meant to encourage communication with the residents. To facilitate maintenance of therapeutic effort, the trainer made informal monthly visits to the nursing homes to verify continued implementation of the Nursing Assistant Communiation Skills Program techniques. Results showed durable effects (6 months posttreatment) on resident depressive symptomatology. However, the effects on resident disruptive behaviors were mixed and generally transient.McCallion, Toseland, and Freeman 1999    also developed a Family Visit Education Program, which focused on improving communication among residents, nursing staff, and visiting family members. Compared with a control group, the Family Visit Education Program showed benefits for residents and family members, but not for nursing staff. Specifically, family members demonstrated improved communication patterns with residents; residents showed improvements in depression, irritability, and verbal behavior. Staff also reported a reduction in agitation.The success of communication-based interventions designed to improve nursing home care depends heavily on the receptiveness of nursing staff to learn new skills and on the establishment of staff motivational systems to ensure the maintenance of these skills (Burgio and Burgio 1990   ; Burgio and Scilley 1994   ; Burgio and Stevens 1999   ; Stevens et al. 1998   ). Staff motivational systems such as behavioral supervision (Burgio and Burgio 1990   ) and total quality management (Schnelle, Ouslander, Osterweil, and Blumenthal 1993   ) have been used successfully to motivate staff in the implementation of a variety of interventions in nursing homes. Behavioral supervision is designed to motivate management and direct care staff to observe and analyze skill performance in order to identify problems and to induce supervisory staff to provide direct and specific feedback suggesting practical ways of maximizing skills (Burgio and Stevens 1999   ; Daniels 1994   ). Using behavioral supervision, Stevens et al. 1998    showed that CNAs could be trained to increase and maintain the rate of task announcements and positive statements made to residents during care over a 46-week assessment period.In a small intra-subject pilot study (N = 8), Allen-Burge, Burgio, Bourgeois, Sims, and Nunnikhoven 2001    examined the effects of communication skills training and the use of memory books. CNAs were taught to use communication skills and memory books during their interactions with residents with mild to moderate cognitive impairment but relatively intact communication abilities. An abbreviated system of behavioral supervision was attempted to encourage performance of these skills on the nursing units. Results showed that, regardless of sporadic implementation of the intervention by nursing staff, the intervention improved communication between staff and residents during care routines, increased the amount of time other residents and visitors spent talking with target residents, and increased the rate of positive statements made by the target residents and others in their immediate environment.The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of communication skills training and the use of individualized memory books in improving communication between CNAs and a larger group of residents (N = 67) during care. In contrast to the pilot study, we used a more comprehensive staff motivation system (behavioral supervision). In addition, formal measures of treatment implementation were included (Lichstein, Riedel, and Grieve 1994   ). We hypothesized that (a) through the use of behavioral supervision, CNAs' use of therapeutic procedures would increase, compared with their baseline performance, and would maintain at a 2-month follow-up assessment; (b) trained CNAs would increase their frequency of overall verbal interaction and positive verbal interactions compared with their own baseline performance and untrained CNAs; and (c) residents on trained nursing units would show increases in overall amount of coherent verbal interaction (i.e., understandable speech) compared with residents on untrained units. Methods Settings This study was conducted in five nursing homes with an average census of 120 residents on three units. On average, 11% of the beds were Medicare, 50% were Medicaid, and the remainder were private pay. Four of the nursing homes were corporately owned facilities; one was privately owned with a religious affiliation. Special care units were not included in the study. Residents had an average length of stay of 3 years; 93% were female, 75% were white, and 25% were African American. Resident-to-CNA ratios were 9:1 during the day shift and 12:1 during the evening shift. Reported yearly rates of staff turnover were 8% among registered nurses (RNs), 18% among licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and 49% among CNAs. The American Health Care Association reported that the national turnover rate is 97% for CNAs (as cited in Harrington et al. 2000   ). Participants Residents Residents were entered into the study on the basis of the following criteria: (a) age of at least 55 years; (b) Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ) total score greater than 0 or Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer 1975   ) with fewer than 10 errors (our purpose for using these criteria were to exclude nonresponsive residents); (c) retention of minimal ability in verbal communication involving spontaneous speech based on criteria established by Bourgeois 1993   (criteria available by writing Louis D. Burgio or Rebecca Allen-Burge); (d) absence of major sensory impairment; (e) life expectancy greater than 6 months; and (f) residence within the facility for at least 1 month. Because of the importance in this study of observing staff–resident interactions during care routines, residents who completed activities of daily living (ADLs) independently during baseline were excluded. Residents were considered independent if the care tasks were completed with no nursing assistant present for at least 5 minutes across two observational occasions during baseline.Two hundred sixty-three of 403 residents in the five nursing homes met entry criteria on the basis of nursing staff referral; 111 consented to participate, the majority through proxy. The consent rate was 42%. Nineteen were excluded during the baseline phase because the communication assessment and ADL observation indicated that they did not meet entry criteria; thus, 92 residents meeting entry criteria completed baseline. A decision was made to include in the data analyses only residents who had data available for all three assessment points (baseline, Postintervention Assessments I and II). Twenty-five residents were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 67 residents for data analysis (33 control and 34 intervention residents). The reasons for exclusion were the following: eight residents died prior to the intervention phase, 9 moved to another nursing unit or different facility, 4 residents or sponsors withdrew consent for participation, and 4 residents refused to be observed during care. There were no significant differences between the surviving (n = 67) and the excluded (n = 25) residents on age, gender, race, dementia diagnosis, MMSE, or Functional Independence Measure (ADL) scores.  Table 1  shows selected characteristics of surviving residents in the study sample at baseline. As can be seen, there were no significant differences between residents on the control and treatment units. Staff Ninety-eight CNAs were working on either the intervention or control units during baseline assessment. Observational data were available during all three assessment points for 64 CNAs; thus, 34 CNAs were dropped from the analysis. There were no differences in gender, race, education, age, or length of service between the 98 CNAs available at baseline and the 64 surviving CNAs.  Table 2  shows selected characteristics of surviving CNAs in the study sample at baseline; however, demographic data were available for only 37 CNAs in the intervention group. As can be seen, there were no significant differences between CNAs on the control units (n = 25) and treatment units (n = 39; 37 providing demographic data). Design and Procedures We used a two-group comparison design with an intragroup comparison component embedded in each group. The two groups were (a) memory book intervention with a staff motivational system and (b) no-treatment control (NTC). The study was conducted sequentially across nursing homes. Upon entering a nursing home, two units were selected randomly and also randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Data were collected on treatment and control units concurrently. We spent the first 3 to 4 weeks in each facility, prior to baseline recording, gathering information on all consenting treatment and control residents and on regular day and evening shift nursing staff.This was followed by a 4-week (Weeks 1 to 4) baseline phase (both units) designed to assess the social environment in the nursing homes before intervention. During this and all phases, direct observational and paper-and-pencil assessments were completed (see Measures section). On treatment units, communication–memory book skill inservice workshops were conducted during a 1-week period immediately following baseline (Week 5; see Intervention Conditions section). This was followed by hands-on training on the intervention units during the next 4 weeks (Weeks 6 to 9). During this phase, CNAs were instructed in the use of communication–memory book skills by research and indigenous nursing staff. Research staff also instructed supervisory nursing staff in the use of the staff motivational system during this time.The next 8 weeks consisted of evaluation of the intervention's effectiveness using the same assessments as at baseline. This assessment period was divided into two phases: Postintervention Assessment I (PIA–I) represented staff and resident performance during the first 4 weeks (Weeks 10 to 13); Postintervention Assessment II (PIA–II) represented their performance during the second 4 weeks of this phase (Weeks 14 to 17). During the first segment of this latter phase, supervisory nursing staff continued to receive assistance from research staff on the use of the staff motivational system. By the end of the phase, indigenous staff controlled all aspects of the system and received no assistance from research staff.To enhance maintenance of the staff motivational system, consultation visits by the project manager were conducted at 3 and 6 weeks after we had departed from the facility (i.e., after PIA–II). Two months after PIA–II, probe follow-up data were collected on staff and resident performance during a 1-week period in four of the five nursing homes. The fifth nursing home declined the follow-up assessment because of a high level of administrative and nursing staff turnover. Observational data were collected using a reduced sampling schedule. Intervention Conditions Communication–Memory Book Skills and Staff Motivational System Participating residents received a personalized 12-page laminated memory book consisting of biographical, orientation, and daily schedule information. Each 5- × 5-in. page included a 6–10 word declarative sentence printed in 14- or 20-point Times New Roman type with a color or black-and-white photograph or line drawing illustrating the statement. Residents' books might contain pictures of their wedding and family, their CNA, other residents, their daily schedule, instructions on bathing, and pages targeting behavior problems such as wandering, aggression, or repetitive questioning. It was the CNA's responsibility to ensure that books were always present in the residents' living space. Residents were provided with individually tailored vests that attached the book to the resident's torso, wheelchair caddies that attached the book to the resident's wheelchair, or a stand to display the book prominently in the resident's room. Additional pages were added to the books every 4 weeks in order to maintain staff and resident interest in this aspect of the intervention. Memory books were replaced by research staff if lost. Replacements were provided for 38% of the residents.All nursing staff on intervention units were trained in the use of memory books and general communication skills. The first component of staff training consisted of a 2-hr inservice session on communication–memory book skills conducted by the project manager (a licensed clinical psychologist). Members of the nursing staff were instructed to use memory books with residents (a) to increase general communication among residents and between nursing staff and residents, (b) to increase the independent functioning of residents during targeted care routines, and (c) as a distraction to decrease resident disruptive behaviors. Inservice materials are available from Louis D. Burgio or Rebecca Allen-Burge on request.CNAs and supervisory staff then attended a 1-hr inservice to introduce the staff motivational system. An additional hour of training was provided to LPNs and RNs on the supervision of this system. The critical roles of the CNA and LPN were emphasized because these members of the nursing staff have the most direct contact with residents (Burgio et al. 1990   ). In addition to didactic training, active learning techniques including the use of role play, discussion of real-life examples from the nursing units, and discussion of written vignettes were used to engage staff. Notebooks were provided to each member of the nursing staff that included all information from the inservices. Staff were encouraged to refer to these notebooks while working with residents on the unit.To increase the likelihood that staff would use the newly learned skills on the units, behavioral supervision (Burgio and Burgio 1990   ) was taught during the inservice, implemented by research staff during the 4-week hands-on training phase and trans-ferred to indigenous nursing home staff during the 8-week postintervention assessment period. Initially, the CNAs were trained by research staff in the use of memory books, communication skills, and components of the staff motivational system. CNAs on the day and evening shifts were observed by research staff once per day while providing care to residents. Researchers and LPNs used the Communication Skills Checklist (CSC) during the care routine to record whether CNAs displayed the skills taught in the inservice; feedback was provided to CNAs regarding their use of the memory books, use of specific versus general instructions, one-step instructions, positive statements, responses to behavioral disturbances, and general distraction techniques. CNAs were provided verbal performance feedback immediately following the care routine. The project manager also completed the Observation of the LPN's Supervisory Activities (OLSA) on the LPNs during this period. Only data collected by research staff were used in outcome analysis.Thirty-nine CNAs on the intervention units were taught to monitor and record their own skill performance as a means of tracking their performance and as a daily reminder of the skills needed to be an effective communicator. CNAs were asked to use the self-monitoring form during shifts worked throughout the week. CNAs had the opportunity to use the form an average of four times (range 1–10) per week. To meet job performance goals, CNAs were asked to complete at least an average of 80% of their assigned self-monitoring forms. To reach performance criterion, they were also expected to obtain an average of 80% accuracy on the CSC completed by LPNs or research assistants.Trained CNAs received public recognition for meeting job performance criteria (i.e., 80% completion of forms and 80% accuracy) by having their names posted weekly on a CNA Honor Roll. Those CNAs whose names appeared on the honor roll received an opportunity for a performance incentive. All honor-roll CNAs listed were entered into a performance-based lottery held once each week for day and evening shifts (Reid, Parsons, and Green 1989   ). For each shift, the individual winning the lottery was provided with his or her choice of incentives from a list of choices determined by each nursing home, including the following: (a) free lunch in the cafeteria every day for 1 week, (b) a "goodie bag" full of inexpensive snacks, beauty products, and knick-knacks, (c) permission to arrive at work 15 min later than scheduled every day for 1 week, (d) permission to leave work 15–30 min earlier than scheduled every day for 1 week, (e) permission to leave work 2.5 hr early on Friday, or (f) 2.5 hr of extra pay. Across nursing homes, the most frequently chosen incentives were the opportunity to leave work earlier than scheduled, extra pay, and goodie bags.LPNs on the intervention unit also received public recognition for meeting job performance criteria (i.e., 80% completion of CNA monitoring and supervisory forms) by having their names posted weekly on an LPN Honor Roll. On average, LPNs were assigned 2–5 CNAs to monitor and supervise in their section on their shift. NTC CNAs and LPNs on the NTC units did not participate in any intervention-related activity. Assessments were conducted on NTC units on the same schedule as on the intervention units. CNAs and LPNs on the intervention units were occasionally pulled to the NTC units. When this occurred, they were asked not to use any of the skills learned on the intervention units. After the 2-month follow-up assessment period, staff on the NTC units were offered instructions and materials on communication–memory book skills. Measurement CNA Communication Skills Checklist The CSC is a direct observation behavioral frequency measure allowing the researcher to assess CNAs' use of specific versus general instructions, one-step instructions, positive statements, biographical statements not included in the memory book (generalization), responses to behavioral disturbances, and use of general distraction techniques (Allen-Burge et al. 2001   ). Research staff attempted to observe every CNA daily during hands-on training, twice during baseline and each of the two postintervention assessments, and once during follow-up. We were successful in completing this target number of observations for 83% of the CNAs. The CSC focused on communication skills demonstrated during a care interaction. To allow for an adequate sampling of CNAs' use of communication–memory book skills, at least three separate care activities (i.e., bathing, dressing, transfer) were included during the observation in order for the data to be retained.A total of 76.37 hr of observation (range 2–60 min per CSC) were completed across all study phases (i.e., 22.60 hr during baseline, 18.94 hr during PIA–I, 16.20 hr during PIA–II, and 18.63 hr during follow-up). Data were expressed as total number of occurrences of each type of statement divided by the total number of seconds in the observation period.Interobserver reliability was assessed independently among observers during 13% (80/603; 14.03 hr) of the observations across all sites and phases. Observer agreement for each behavioral category measured by the CSC was calculated by using a total occurrence agreement calculation. The average percentage of agreement for this measure across all categories was 84% (range 71%–99%). OLSA The OLSA allows the researcher to measure LPNs' accuracy in observing and recording CNA skill performance during supervision, and LPNs' skill in providing CNAs with verbal performance feedback. As part of the staff motivational system, LPNs observed each of the CNAs under their supervision once per week using a form similar to the CSC during 15-min samples of care routines with residents. During these observations, LPNs recorded the occurrence of CNAs' use of memory books, specific versus general instructions, one-step instructions, positive statements, negative or unhelpful statements, biographical statements not included in the memory book, and CNAs' responses to behavioral disturbances.LPNs' accuracy was checked against the project manager's recording of the same behaviors during the same observation. The project manager was present with LPNs observing CNAs using the CSC during the staff training period. The OLSA also allowed the project manager to rate the LPNs' use of verbal supervisory feedback. Verbal supervisory feedback is rated with regard to beginning and ending a session with a supportive statement to the CNA, the provision of accurate and specific positive and corrective feedback to the CNA, the provision of specific performance scores to the CNA with a statement indicating the CNA's training status, and the provision of an opportunity for the CNA to discuss any of the feedback given by the LPN.CNAs received positive or negative written feedback letters at the end of the hands-on training period and at the end of PIA–I. To receive a positive feedback letter, CNAs had to attain an average performance score of 80% or better in their completion of self-monitoring forms and LPN evaluations for the previous 4-week period. These letters were placed in the CNAs' personnel files, and copies were given to CNAs and to administrative nursing staff. Computer-Assisted Behavioral Observation System (CABOS): Hardware and Software As in Burgio, Scilley, Hardin, Hsu, and Yancey 1996    prior research, the Portable Computer Systems for Observational Research software programs from Communitech International (DeKalb, IL) were used for this project (Repp, Karsh, van Acker, Felce, and Harman 1989   ). The recording of behavior was synchronized with each computer's internal time clock and controlled through a software routine.Real-time CABOS data were generated by sampling behaviors during care interaction between residents and their primary day- and/or evening-shift CNA. All participating residents were observed twice during baseline, PIA–I and PIA–II, and once during follow-up. Care routines had to be at least 5 min in length for the data to be retained.Domains of behavior divided into mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories relevant to the hypothesized outcomes were identified, and detailed operational definitions were generated for all behavior codes within categories. One category coded the residents' activity, including the amount of ADL care. Four categories coded aspects of the residents' social environment: (a) nonverbal presence of staff or other residents, (b) verbal interaction, (c) verbal content, and (d) disruptive behaviors. Each behavioral category contained codes that allowed specification of type of behavior within the category and whether it was initiated by staff or resident (e.g., content had separate positive and negative statement codes).A total of 70.29 hr of observation (range 5–51 min per care interaction) was completed across all study phases (i.e., 24.24 hr during baseline, 20.31 hr during PIA–I, 18.90 hr during PIA–II, 6.84 hr during follow-up). Interobserver agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa (Cohen 1968   ; Hays 1994   ). Reliability was assessed independently among four observers during 14% (14.03 hr) of the total observation time across all phases. Average kappa reliability across all categories was .79 (range .68–.95). In behavioral research, recommended lower limits for acceptable kappas range from .60 to .75 (Hartmann 1982   ). Memory Book Checks Research assistants recorded whether residents were in possession of memory books (i.e., memory books were prominently displayed and within arm's reach of the resident) during separate observational checks conducted twice daily, once during the morning and evening shifts. This yielded a total of 282 checks during PIA–I, PIA–II, and the 2-month follow-up assessment. Data were recorded dichotomously (yes/no) at both checks for each resident. Because NTC residents did not possess memory books, checks were conducted only on intervention units. Paper-and-Pencil Measures Assessment instruments were administered either by a clinical psychologist or by research assistants trained and supervised by the clinical psychologist to administer these measures. MMSE (Folstein et al. 1975   ) The MMSE, a measure of global cognitive ability, measures orientation, immediate and delayed recall for words, attention and concentration, language, and praxis (total score range 0–30). The test–retest and interevaluator reliabilities are .89 and .83, respectively. Functional Independence Measure (FIM)—REACH Version Information for completing this instrument was provided by CNAs familiar with the daily care needs of the participating resident (Hamilton, Laughlin, Fiedler, and Granger 1994   ; Kidd et al. 1995   ). The version used in this study was developed for the National Institutes of Health–funded cooperative agreement Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH; Coon, Schulz, and Ory 1999   ). As in the REACH project, only the motor subscale consisting of self-care, sphincter control, transfer, and locomotion items was used in this study (total score range 13–91). Reliability data indicated an intraclass correlation coefficient of .96 for the motor domain, with unweighted kappas ranging from .53 to .66 (Hamilton et al. 1994   ). Method of Analysis Analyses were conducted on the CSC and on CABOS data collected during care routines. CNAs were the unit of analysis for CSC data; data were expressed as mean rate of CNA statements per hour. CSC outcome data included (a) the rate of specific, one-step instructions, (b) the rate of CNA positive statements, (c) the rate of biographical statements, (d) the rate of multiple-step instructions, and (e) the total duration of care. CABOS data were expressed as mean total percentage of observation time spent in each activity or mean rate per hour of positive statements, and the unit of analysis was the resident. CABOS outcome data included (a) total percentage of time of resident coherent verbal interaction, (b) total percentage of time of staff speech directed to the resident, and (c) the rate per hour of positive statements made by either residents or CNAs. We did not discriminate between staff and resident positive statements on this variable. Positive statements are brief duration events and were expressed as the rate of statements per hour.Our analytic questions centered on (a) assessment of treatment delivery and enactment (Lichstein et al. 1994   ), (b) establishing an initial change in behavior for both staff and residents after implementation of the intervention, and (c) assessing the maintenance of any staff or resident behavior change 2 months later. Descriptive statistics were used to address the first question. For the second analytical question, analyses were run by calculating 2 (group) × 3 (time) mixed-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the between-subjects factor Group included intervention and control and the within-subjects factor Time included baseline, PIA–I, and PIA–II phases. The primary outcome of interest in these analyses were significant Group × Time interaction effects, showing that the intervention group improved in the targeted behavioral outcomes for CNAs and residents over and above any improvements seen in the control group as a result of the passage of time or observation. For these interaction effects, Greenhouse-Geisser p values are reported throughout in order to correct for potential violations to the sphericity assumption (Winer 1971   ).Finally, a 2 (group) × 2 (time) mixed-factor ANOVA was run comparing PIA–II outcomes to follow-up. The primary outcome of interest in these analyses were significant main effects of Group, showing that intervention participants maintained any behavior change. Results Treatment Receipt and Enactment Memory Book Availability Observational data from research staff memory book checks indicated that residents were in possession of their memory books during 72% of the morning checks and 75% of the afternoon checks during the hands-on training phase. This figure remained steady or increased during the PIA–I (70% morning, 73% afternoon), PIA–II (78% morning, 81% afternoon), and 2-month follow-up phases (77% morning, 80% afternoon). CNA/LPN Training and Performance of the Staff Motivational System Thirty-nine CNAs with data at all three assessment times (baseline, PIA–I, PIA–II) completed the hands-on training phase on the intervention units. Of these 39 CNAs, 92% (n = 36) passed a final evaluation with a performance score of 80% or above in the use of communication skills as measured by the CSC. The average final evaluation score for CNAs was 84.77% (range 53%–97%). The average number of training sessions on the unit per CNA was 6 (range 1–13).CNAs completed an average of 64% of their self-monitoring forms during the training phase (SD = 28%; range 5%–100%). The percentage of self-monitoring forms completed increased somewhat during the postintervention phases (PIA–I M = 67%, SD = 33%, range 0%–100%; PIA–II M = 66%, SD = 36%, range 0%–100%). CNAs were not required to self-monitor during the follow-up phase.Across the five nursing homes, a total of 55 written feedback letters regarding CNAs' skill performance were distributed. Fifty-eight percent of these letters were positive; 42% were negative. The number of supervisory training sessions conducted with 20 LPNs ranged between two and four. One hundred percent of LPNs reached a criterion of 80% correct performance in their accuracy of CSC recording and the provision of verbal feedback to CNAs regarding communication skill performance by the end of the hands-on training phase. On average, during the training phase LPNs conducted 62% (SD = 36%, range 0%–100%) of their assigned observations of CNAs. This number remained relatively stable after the hands-on training phase when LPNs conducted CNA observations independently (i.e., not accompanied by the project manager). During PIA–I, LPNs conducted 57% (SD = 44%, range 0%–100%) of their assigned independent observations, and during PIA–II LPNs conducted 61% (SD = 46%, range 0%–100%). CNA Use of Communication Skills There were no baseline differences between intervention and control groups on the CSC-generated overall communication skills score, time spent giving care to residents, specific one-step instructions, multistep instructions, positive statements, or biographical statements.Results of the 2 (group) × 3 (time) ANOVA analyses are shown in  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3 . The mixed-factor ANOVA for the overall total correct communication skill percentage score revealed significant main effects of group, F(1,62) = 16.87, p = .0001, and time, F(2,124) = 37.30, p = .0001, and a significant Group × Time interaction, F(2,124) = 17.20, p = .0001 (see  Fig. 1 ). CNAs in the intervention group improved their use of general communication skills with residents during care in comparison with NTC group CNAs at both PIA–I and PIA–II.More specifically, CNAs in the intervention group tended to increase their rate per hour use of specific, one-step instructions during care in comparison with control group CNAs at both PIA–I and PIA–II (see  Fig. 2 ), as shown by a marginally significant Group × Time interaction, F(2,124) = 2.80, p = .06. Intervention CNAs significantly increased their rate of positive statements made to residents during care in comparison with control group CNAs at both PIA–I and PIA–II (see  Fig. 3 ), as shown by a significant Group × Time interaction, F(2,124) = 6.16, p = .004. There was also a significant group effect with intervention CNAs using fewer multistep instructions, F(1,62) = 5.21, p = .03, but no Group × Time interaction. There were no differences between intervention and control group CNAs across time in use of biographical statements. Notably, there was also no difference between intervention and control group CNAs across time in the amount of time spent in daily care with residents.Forty-three residents (21 control, 22 intervention) and 29 CNAs (13 control, 16 intervention) had data available from all assessment points from baseline assessment through the 2-month follow-up (i.e., maintenance sample). Analyses indicated that there were no significant differences in the characteristics of residents or CNAs who survived to follow-up and those who completed baseline. There were also no differences between CNAs on the control and intervention units at the 2-month follow-up assessment. The only significant difference between residents on the control and intervention units at the 2-month follow-up was that residents on intervention units were more independent in self-care as measured by the FIM, F(1,41) = 4.33, p = .04.Results of the ANOVAs show significant main effects of group in overall communication skills score on the CSC, F(1,27) = 12.92, p = .001 ( Fig. 1 ) and the use of positive statements, F(1,27) = 11.91, p = .002 ( Fig. 3 ), indicating maintenance of change at the 2-month follow-up assessment point. CNA–Resident Interactions During Care Results of the 2 (group) × 3 (time) mixed-factor ANOVA of the CABOS care interaction data are shown in  Fig. 4  and  Fig. 5 . There were significant main effects of group, F(1,65) = 5.37, p = .02, and time, F(2,130) = 8.57, p = .0003, and a significant Group × Time interaction, F(2,130) = 4.11, p = .02, for the total amount of staff speech directed toward residents (see  Fig. 4 ). CNAs in the intervention group increased their verbal interaction with residents during care in comparison with control group CNAs at PIA–II.Regarding resident coherent verbal interaction, only the main effects of group, F(1,65) = 6.50, p = .01, and time, F(2,130) = 3.20, p = .05, were significant. However, the rate of positive verbal interactions between CNAs and residents during care routines increased in the intervention group across time, as shown in  Fig. 5  by a significant Group × Time interaction, F(2,130) = 4.81, p = .01.Analysis of maintenance data indicated that there were significant main effects of group for total amount of staff speech, F(1,41) = 5.20, p = .03 ( Fig. 4 ), and positive statements by either staff or resident (i.e., positive verbal interactions), F(1,41) = 5.83, p = .02 ( Fig. 5 ). Intervention group CNAs maintained a higher rate of speech with residents during care, and there were more positive statements made during care in CNA–resident dyads in the intervention group.The occurrence of agitation during care among the 67 residents was extremely low during all phases of the study (e.g., on average less than 1% of observation time). Thus, changes in this behavior could not be assessed. Discussion The results of this study suggest that, through the use of communication–memory book skills training and a staff motivational system, CNAs can improve aspects of their communication with nursing home residents. CSC data, derived from direct observation of care interactions, showed that CNAs' overall communication skills level increased significantly as compared with an NTC group. CNAs increased their use of positive statements and showed a marginal increase (p = .06) in single, one-step instructions, which can be less confusing than multiple nonspecific instructions when interacting with individuals with cognitive impairments. Moreover, CABOS data showed a significant increase in the amount of staff speech directed toward the resident during care routines. Finally, a behavioral code measuring the amount of positive statements during CNA–resident verbal interactions also showed a significant increase. Importantly, all of the changes in staff behavior were maintained at an assessment conducted 4 months after the initiation of treatment. Thus, the current data would appear to corroborate pilot data from Allen-Burge and colleagues 2001    and the findings of McCallion and colleagues 1999   .These changes in staff behavior were brought about without increasing the amount of time necessary to deliver daily care. It has been argued that even if CNAs can be taught to play a more therapeutic role in the nursing home, it would require a time commitment that might not be feasible in the current nursing home environment (Schnelle and Beck 1999   ). For example, Rogers and colleagues 1999    reported success in training research therapists to increase independent dressing in residents; however, their therapeutic procedure required more time for staff to complete. Our data suggest that using better communication skills and memory books during care routines does not require more staff time. It is important that researchers delineate which therapeutic routines do and do not require additional time commitments so that staffing adjustments can be made when planning therapeutic routines.Contrary to our hypothesis, residents in the intervention group did not improve their rate of coherent verbal interactions with CNAs during care routines in comparison with control group residents. As discussed above, there was a significant increase in the rate of positive statements during CNA–resident interactions after training. However, due to our definition of this behavioral code, we did not examine how much residents contributed to this increase. Moreover, we were unable to assess any positive effects of the intervention on disruptive behavior due to its extremely low rate of occurrence in this sample. In this study, residents were required to show minimal ability in verbal communication involving spontaneous speech for entry. Consequently, residents were, on average, moderately cognitively impaired (MMSE M = 13.39), and prior research has indicated that moderately cognitively impaired residents are less likely to display serious disruptive behaviors (Burgio et al. 1994   ; Cohen-Mansfield, Werner, and Marx 1990   ).A main feature of this study was the careful attention given to the assessment of treatment implementation (Lichstein et al. 1994   ). Although the assessment of treatment implementation has long been a standard in nongerontological psychosocial intervention research (Cook and Campbell 1979   ; Moncher and Prinz 1991   ; Sechrest, West, Phillips, Redner, and Yeaton 1979   ), it has seldom been used in gerontological intervention research (Burgio, Corcoran, et al. 2001   ). Aspects of treatment receipt (e.g., CNAs' understanding of and use of the treatment) and treatment enactment (e.g., use of the staff motivational system and memory books by CNAs and LPNs) were investigated. The methodological advantages of directly assessing the implementation of interventions in applied settings are numerous and include greater assurance in the internal and external validity of the study. Internal validity concerns whether observed changes in behavior in CNA and resident outcomes actually coincide with increased use of the communication–memory book skills by CNAs. Measurements of treatment implementation also provide guidelines for the assessment of external validity by indicating what level of enactment of therapeutic skills by indigenous nursing staff was necessary to produce the observed therapeutic gains.Our results show that both CNAs and LPNs received (i.e., learned) the intervention as we intended. Ninety-two percent of CNAs demonstrated through direct observational evaluation that they could perform communication skills at the 80% criterion. One hundred percent of the LPNs reached a criterion of 80% accuracy of completing the CSC as compared with the project manager's completion of the CSC.Demonstrating skill acquisition in no way guarantees that staff will use these skills in the clinical setting. However, our assessment of treatment enactment shows that memory books were available to staff and residents during an average of 76% of observations. Their availability remained constant after the intervention was transferred completely to indigenous staff.CNAs completed an average of 66% of their self-monitoring forms. LPNs sent CNA performance feedback memos as instructed, and they completed an average of 60% of assigned observations of CNAs with the CSC form. This also remained relatively constant throughout all phases of the study. Although the completion of CNA self-monitoring forms and LPN CSC observations were only in the 60% range, considering the workload of these personnel we consider this to indicate successful, though less than ideal, treatment enactment.There are several limitations of this study. First, the reported CNA turnover rate in the nursing homes was 49%, well below the national average of 97% (American Health Care Association, 1997, cited in Harrington et al. 2000   ). Large staff turnover rates present significant difficulties in implementing psychosocial interventions, and our results may not be replicable in more typical nursing homes with larger turnover rates. In this study, newly hired staff viewed videotapes of the inservice, and hands-on training was also provided. Still, it is possible that continuous training of incoming staff in nursing homes with turnover near 100% may present challenging logistical problems.In all studies using direct observational measurement, participant reaction to observation is a potential problem. Specifically, the CNAs' performance of skills during observation may be influenced by social desirability factors and may not be representative of their actual day-to-day performance. There is no completely satisfactory answer to this problem, and we do not know to what degree social desirability influenced the CNA results. However, in this and our prior studies, we have developed specific procedures for observing staff unobtrusively; thus, and presumably, limiting reactivity (see Burgio 1996   , and Burgio, Scilley, Hardin, and Hsu 2001   , for a more detailed discussion of this issue).Multiple outcome measures were collected to provide a comprehensive assessment of treatment effects. This was useful for broadly identifying effects on CNA behavior, resident responses, and CNA–resident interactions. However, the Type I error rate is undoubtedly inflated by the fact that no adjustments were made for each individual analysis. A Bonferroni correction might be considered, although this procedure markedly elevates the Type II error rate and decreases power. Given the relatively limited sample size available for this initial efficacy evaluation, we chose to not implement this more conservative approach. Exact probability levels are reported instead so that the reader can make any interpretive adjustments deemed necessary.Another potential limitation was our choice to randomize nursing units within each nursing home into groups instead of randomizing entire nursing homes. Because CNAs were occasionally pulled to work on other nursing units, it is possible that trained CNAs applied communication skills on control units. This is a potential threat to the study's internal validity. However, we believe that this threat was minimized by including only nursing homes using fixed staffing and minimal pulling. The alternative of randomizing groups to nursing homes presents its own methodological problems, including the difficulty of finding nursing homes that are equivalent on all factors that might affect outcome. We have written about this dilemma in more depth elsewhere (Burgio and Stevens 1999   ).Because this was an evaluation of a multicomponent treatment package, we do not know the separate contribution of communication training and memory book usage to the changes in staff behavior. Perhaps more important, we do not know whether the inclusion of a staff motivational system was necessary for producing and maintaining staff behavior change. Studies that have used similar training techniques, including hands-on training, have generally shown an immediate training effect but no maintenance of behavior change (e.g., Schnelle, Newman, and Fogarty 1990   ). In a study currently under review (Burgio, Stevens, et al. 2001   ) we compared a behavior management skills training package with and without a staff motivational system. As hypothesized, results showed an immediate training effect for both groups, but maintenance of CNAs' behavior change was demonstrated more frequently at a 6-month follow-up in the group that received a staff motivational system.In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that CNAs can be trained to use improved communication skills and memory books with their residents during care interactions. With the use of a staff motivational system integrated into the training program, staff will perform these skills and will maintain this performance up to 4 months after the initiation of training. Although increases were observed in the overall amount of staff speech during interactions, use of positive statements, and positive statements during dyadic interactions between staff and residents, there is no direct evidence of changes in the resident communication behaviors targeted in this study. Future studies may want to examine other resident behaviors that may be influenced by improved CNA communication skills. One candidate for investigation is resident affect, which has been shown to be sensitive to change due to intervention in residents with dementia (Lawton, Van Haitsma, and Klapper 1996   ).Finally, although management of the intervention program was transferred to indigenous staff midway through the intervention phase, this was predominantly an efficacy trial. To optimize the internal validity of the study, training was conducted by a PhD-level licensed clinical psychologist, both inservice and hands-on training were used, and, as discussed above, nursing homes with relatively low rates of CNA turnover were chosen. Although it is our belief that this intervention can be manualized and implemented by typical staff development personnel in most nursing homes, only an effectiveness trial can shed light on the true feasibility of this intervention program.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study adapts the Stress Process Model (SPM) of family caregiving to examine the predictors of depression in a sample of caregivers (n = 133) with demented relatives residing in suburban skilled nursing facilities. Design and Methods: We interviewed family caregivers of family members residing in skilled nursing homes using a variety of measures to assess primary stressors, secondary strain, nursing home stressors, and caregiver depression. We used block-wise regression analyses to determine the predictors of caregiver de-pression. Results: Results indicated that positive resident adjustment to placement was best predicted by the closeness of the resident–caregiver relationship and nursing home stressors. Caregiver strain, resident adjustment, and nursing home stressors best predicted caregiver adjustment. In turn, the best predictors of caregiver depression included caregiver age, caregiver adjustment to the nursing home, and nursing home stressors. Implications:These results suggest that caregiver depression is closely linked to how well both the resident and caregiver adjust to the nursing home environment. Results also indicate that by broadening the SPM to include stressors common to the nursing home experience, researchers will be able to understand more clearly the specific components of the stress process that may lead to depression in family caregivers of persons living in nursing homes.   Caregiver depression ,  Family caregiver adjustment ,  Nursing home placement Decision Editor: Vernon L. Greene, PhDThere is substantial empirical evidence indicating that the stress of providing long-term in-home care for a cognitively impaired relative is associated with compromised mental health functioning. Family caregivers are more depressed than age-matched controls in the general population (Haley, Levine, Brown, Berry, and Hughes 1987   ), and report emotional strain in terms of higher levels of depression, anger, and anxiety (Anthony-Bergstone, Zarit, and Gatz 1988   ; Friss and Whitlatch 1991   ; Gallagher, Rose, Rivera, Lovett, and Thompson 1989   ). Elevated levels of depression and distress among caregivers are related to the impaired adult's functional and behavioral characteristics (e.g., need for assistance with personal care like bathing, feeding, toileting) and level of cognitive or behavioral impairment (e.g., memory, wandering, agitation, aggressive behavior; Clipp and George 1993   ; Deimling and Bass 1986   ; Miller, McFall, and Montgomery 1991   ; Pruchno and Resch 1989   ; Schulz and Williamson 1991   ; Sheehan and Nuttall 1988   ). Similarly, sociodemographic characteristics of both the impaired adult and caregiver are linked to compromised caregiver mental health. Many studies report gender and kin group differences in levels of caregiver depression: female caregivers are typically more depressed than male caregivers (Dura, Haywood-Niler, and Kiecolt-Glaser 1990   ; Friss and Whitlatch 1991   ; Schulz and Williamson 1991   ; Schulz, Williamson, Morycz, and Biegel 1993   ; Tennstedt, Cafferata, and Sullivan 1992   ) and wives are more distressed than husbands (Fitting, Rabins, Lucas, and Eastham 1986   ).Over the years, research efforts have led to greater specification of mental health indicators for in-home caregivers, yet few studies have examined these indicators for caregivers who have relatives living in long-term care environments. Early research suggests that most caregivers do not abandon their relatives after placement (Pratt, Schmall, Wright, and Hare 1987   ; Smith and Bengtson 1979   ), but remain involved with their relatives in a variety of ways (Chenoweth and Spencer 1986   ; Rosenthal, Sulman, and Marshall 1993   ; Townsend 1990   ). Family caregivers continue to provide a great deal of hands-on care for and remain emotionally involved with their relatives after placement (Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ). They visit often, help with feeding and personal care, and work with nursing home staff to ensure their relative obtains the best care possible. Only a handful of studies have examined how the experiences of placing a relative affect the mental health of family caregivers, such as increased feelings of guilt and depression. Family caregivers who have recently placed a demented relative report relatively high levels of depression, anger, and anxiety and many continue to experience these negative consequences up to three years after placing their relative (Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ). These same caregivers, however, also report feeling less overwhelmed and tired (Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ) than their in-home care peers. Placement seems to have a selective effect on caregiver outcomes suggesting that caregiver stress and emotional well-being must be thoroughly evaluated within the context of the various transitions experienced by family caregivers.Research by Pearlin and colleagues (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, and Whitlatch 1995   ; Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, and Skaff 1990   ; Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ) indicates that the Stress Process Model (SPM) of family caregiving is useful in the conceptualization of stress proliferation and containment for both in-home caregivers and those who continue to provide care after placing their relative. Briefly, this model proposes that there are a host of stressors specifically associated with family caregiving. As described by Aneshensel and associates 1995   , caregiving stressors are "the problematic conditions and difficult circumstances experienced by caregivers" which "exceed or push to the limit" the caregiver's ability to adapt (p. 34). These stressors are influenced by a variety of background and contextual characteristics of the caregiver and impaired adult (i.e., sociodemographic factors), primary objective and subjective stressors (i.e., impaired adult functional abilities and caregiver overload), and secondary role strains (e.g., work and/or economic strain, etc.). Together, stressors and contextual factors can proliferate to such an extent that they produce negative caregiver outcomes that are the consequences of caregiving stress.The SPM is broad in scope and dynamic in nature making it easily adapted to test the course of stress for persons involved in a variety of caregiving situations. In the original presentation of the SPM, Pearlin and colleagues 1990    emphasized the stress associated with providing in-home care to persons with dementia. More recent and longitudinal work has since expanded the model to explain stress proliferation and containment for "placement" caregivers, those facing the death of a demented elder, and caregivers of persons with AIDS (Aneshensel et al. 1995   ; Mullan 1992   , Mullan 1998   ; Pearlin, Aneshensel, and LeBlanc 1997   ; Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ). The present study further expands the SPM by introducing stressors associated with the changing nature of the relationship between the family caregiver and impaired adult in institutional settings. The SPM for Family Caregivers of Nursing Home Residents The process of placing a family member into a long-term care setting brings additional stressors and strains to the lives of caregivers. Stressors common to placement involve the new relationships and interactions that must be negotiated with staff, residents, and families of other residents. A wife who finds it necessary to place her demented husband must interact with staff and administrators to insure her husband receives the best care possible. She develops relationships with other residents and their families. These interactions have the potential to be positive and/or negative. As well, placement leads to role changes for the family caregiver. The caregiver must relinquish her role as the primary provider of her husband's personal care. She may continue to provide limited hands-on care for her husband, but may find that there are new roles she is expected to fulfill as well. If her husband has difficulty adjusting to his new environment (e.g., becomes more disoriented, refuses to eat), she may experience increased stress and compromised emotional well-being. These caveats illustrate the many changes and resulting stress that a caregiver may experience once a relative moves to an institutional setting. We have incorporated these additional stressors into an expanded SPM that broadens the conceptualization of primary subjective stressors and secondary role strains and adds the dimension of nursing home stressors in order to reflect the experience of "placement" caregivers.First, as seen in  Fig. 1 , in addition to caregiver strain, we have broadened the conceptualization of primary subjective stress to include a dimension of the emotional closeness of the resident and family caregiver. In addition, we have included a measure of the caregivers' subjective appraisal of their own difficulty in dealing with the relative's mental and emotional state. These two additional stressors reflect the "restructured relationship between caregiver and patient" (Pearlin et al. 1990   , p. 588) that may occur as a result of nursing home placement.Next, we have responded to anecdotal evidence suggesting that caregivers are keenly aware of their relative's reaction and adjustment to living in a nursing home, regardless of the relative's level of cognitive impairment. We have conceptualized this awareness of resident adjustment as a secondary role strain for a number of reasons. First, caregivers often feel responsible for their relative's comfort, happiness, and satisfaction with the new living arrangement. Feeling responsible for their relative's well-being and happiness is especially significant if the caregivers believe that the move to a nursing home was somehow against the wishes or preferences of the relative. Often, we see caregivers assuming new roles, which require them to do their best to ensure their relative's well-being and happiness. Therefore, we have added a measure of the caregivers' perception of "how well" their relative has adjusted to the nursing home environment. If caregivers believe their relative is not adjusting well, caregivers are likely to feel great pressure to remedy the situation thereby increasing the potential for additional role strain in the caregivers' lives. In addition, caregivers' perceptions of their own adjustment to the nursing home and the new roles they assume are indicators of the stress they feel. Thus, we have added two secondary role strains to the SPM to account for the stress associated with the adjustment of both residents and caregivers to the nursing home.Third, consistent with the original SPM's emphasis on the context of caregiving, we have added the domain of nursing home stressors. As noted, the potential stress of placement takes many forms for caregivers including visiting the facility, interactions with others (e.g., the impaired relative, staff, and families of other residents), and activities while visiting (e.g., helping to feed the relative). These stressors are likely to influence how well both the impaired resident and family caregiver adjust to the nursing home environment and, in turn, contribute to caregiver outcomes, specifically, caregiver depression. Research Questions The present study broadens the SPM of family caregiving for use with a sample of caregivers of demented family members residing in nursing homes. By examining "placement" caregivers, a group whose well-being has the potential to be compromised, we are able to explore the particular mechanisms of the stress process in order to understand the various contexts within which caregiving stress occurs. Specifically, the present study focuses on the influence of resident and caregiver adjustment to placement and how this adjustment predicts depression in family caregivers. Our work addresses three important research questions: (a) What are the stressors associated with family caregiving in a long-term care environment (e.g., problems or dissatisfaction with staff, services, etc.)? (b) How are these nursing home stressors related to resident and caregiver adjustment to placement? (c) How do resident and caregiver adjustment and nursing home stressors contribute to depression for caregivers of institutionalized family members? Methods Study Sites We obtained cross-sectional data from in-person interviews with family caregivers of residents with diagnosed dementia. The five study sites were skilled nursing facilities located in suburban areas of Cleveland, Ohio, that ranged in size from 82 to 203 beds. We selected these facilities because they primarily serve residents with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. Two of the facilities were philanthropic, and three were proprietary; four of the five included special dementia care units. The data presented here are from a larger study that also included in-person interviews with 114 nursing assistants of the residents to examine factors affecting their job satisfaction and the quality of their relationship with families (Looman, Noelker, Schur, Whitlatch, and Ejaz 1997   ; Noelker, Schur, Looman, Ejaz, and Whitlatch 1996   ; Schur, Noelker, Looman, Whitlatch, and Ejaz 1998   ). Sample To obtain the sample, each nursing home supplied research staff with a list of residents who met the following criteria: (a) a diagnosis of irreversible dementia, (b) a resident in the current unit for at least 2 months, and (c) a family member listed as the resident's primary responsible party. Participating nursing homes supplied contact information for eligible family members. We sent each family member a letter signed by the facility administrator on nursing home letterhead. The letter briefly described the study and indicated that someone from the research staff would contact families within a few weeks unless they preferred not to be contacted. No family members dropped out of the study at this point. Next, field operation staff screened family members via telephone to determine whether the family members visited the resident at least twice a month and had contact with the nursing assistants. Of the initial 331 caregivers screened, the staff found 101 (30.5%) ineligible (e.g., primary responsible party was not a family member, resident admitted less than two months previously, or responsible party was unable to participate because of the death of their relative), 72 (21.8%) refused to participate, and 25 (7.6%) could not be contacted. The final sample (n = 133) represents 57.8% of the 230 caregivers eligible to participate in the study. Field operation staff forwarded contact information for family members who met all inclusion criteria and agreed to participate to interviewers for scheduling. Interviewers conducted interviews face-to-face in the caregiver's home or the relative's nursing home from July 1994 through August 1995. Measures Structured interviews consisted of close- and open-ended questions which examined five domains of the SPM: (a) caregiver and resident background characteristics (i.e., sociodemographics), (b) primary objective and subjective stressors related to the resident's functional status, problem behaviors, caregiver strain, and the closeness of the resident–caregiver relationship, (c) nursing home related stressors, (d) secondary role strains in the form of resident and caregiver adjustment to placement, and (e) caregiver depression.Caregiver and resident background characteristics included age, gender, education, marital status, employment status, caregiver and resident living arrangement preplacement, length of resident's occupancy in the current facility, and caregiver kin group (e.g., wife, husband, and adult child caregiver).We measured primary objective stressors related to the resident's functional status in two ways. First, we asked caregivers whether their impaired relative was currently able to perform seven activities of daily living (ADLs) including positioning self in bed, getting up from bed and/or chair, moving about room, dressing self, feeding self, managing own personal care (combing hair, shaving, etc.), and using the toilet. Response options ranged from "none of the time," and "some of the time," to "all or a good part of the time." Possible summary scores ranged from 0 to 14 with higher scores indicating greater physical impairment (α = .92). Second, we asked caregivers if their family member showed signs of problematic behaviors (e.g., moaning, shouting or yelling, biting or spitting, hitting or slapping or other physically aggressive behaviors). Response options included "none of the time," "some of the time," "a good part of the time" or "all of the time." A summary measure of these items ranged from 4 to 16 with higher scores indicating greater frequency of occurrence (α = .71).We measured primary subjective stress in three ways. First, a seven-item indicator of care-related strain assessed the stress a caregiver feels as a result of having a relative in a nursing home. Examples of questions include: (a) "I don't have enough time for myself," (b) "I have more things to do than I can handle," (c) "I feel that my social life is limited," and (d) "I have trouble managing all the demands on my life." Caregivers chose between four response options: (a) strongly agree, (b) agree, (c) disagree, and (d) strongly disagree. Possible scores ranged from 7 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater care-related strain (α = .90).Second, we added a measure of the caregiver's perception of the "closeness of the relationship" between the caregiver and resident. This measure of closeness (α = .90) included six items: (a) "My relative always understood what I value in life," (b) "My relationship with my relative has always been close," (c) "My relative always made me feel that whatever I did for him/her was not enough," (d) "My relative always made me feel like a special person," (e) "My relative was often critical of me," and (f) "My relative and I could always discuss things together." Four response options were possible from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" with higher scores reflecting a more close relationship between caregiver and impaired relative (range from 6 to 24).Third, we added a single-item measure of the caregiver's difficulty in dealing with the relative's mental state. This question asked caregivers "How much difficulty do you have with your relative's mental or emotional state?" (no difficulty = 0, some difficulty = 1, a great deal of difficulty = 2). Responses were coded so that higher scores indicated more stressful reactions (e.g., caregiver had a great deal of difficulty with their relative's mental and emotional state).We expanded secondary role strains to include the adjustment of both the resident and caregiver to the experiences of institutionalization. We added these stressors to our model to reflect the role stress experienced by caregivers as they adjust to the new and shifting responsibilities associated with nursing home care. In addition, we propose that caregivers' perception of how well the relative adjusts to the nursing home will have a profound influence on the role stress experienced by caregivers. The placement of these indicators within the domain of secondary role strains is based on the original SPM, which defines secondary stress as derived from the primary stressors driving the stress process. Thus, the caregiver's adjustment to placement is a product of primary conditions related to the resident's physical abilities and adjustment. Caregivers rated both their relative's level of adjustment to the nursing home as well as their own adjustment. These single item questions reflected adaptation ranging from very poor/poor, fair, good, and very good/excellent with higher scores indicating better perceived adjustment (range 0 to 3).We categorized nursing home stressors into five domains. The first two domains assessed caregivers' perceptions of the nursing assistants' (NAs') attitudes toward them as family members of residents in their care. We asked caregivers to respond to 20 questions by answering either "most of the time," "some of the time," or "hardly ever" with higher scores reflecting that NAs had more positive attitudes toward the family caregivers. Results of factor analysis revealed two distinct measures. The first measure, NAs' communication with residents' families (α = .73), assessed the caregivers' opinions of how well they were treated by the NAs when they visited the nursing home. This six-item measure included questions such as do NAs (a) "greet you when you visit," (b) "seem glad to see you," (c) "seem interested in learning more about your relative by talking with you," (d) "have all the information they need to care for your relative properly," (e) "respond to your questions promptly," and (f) "act rude or unpleasant." Scores ranged from 2 to 12 with higher scores indicating more positive communication by NAs with residents' family members. The second measure, NAs' support for families (α = .76), was composed of five items that rated the caregivers' perceptions that NAs provided support and reassurance to family caregivers. Items included statements such as the NA (a) "reassures me that my family member's behavior is not unusual," (b) "helps me know who to contact at the home regarding a problem," (c) "encourages me to talk about my fears and concerns," (d) "keeps me informed about changes in my relative's condition," and (e) "understands that having my family member in a home is stressful for me." Scores ranged from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more supportive and reassuring NA relationships.The third domain included measures that assessed dimensions associated with personal interactions and experiences within the nursing home environment. We asked family caregivers if there were persons at the facility that they confided in, felt frustrated by, made them laugh, etc. Questions included the number of positive and negative interactions family caregivers had with (a) their institutionalized relatives, (b) the staff at the facility, (c) other residents, and (d) the families of other residents. We worded five positive items to determine (a) if caregivers felt they were "able to confide in relative/staff/families," (b) if they felt "relative/staff/families were capable of reassuring them when they were upset," (c) if relative/staff/families "showed respect to families," (d) if relative/staff/families "made them laugh," and (e) if relative/staff/families were "affectionate." We worded negative items to determine if caregivers felt the relative, staff, or families of other residents made the caregiver feel "frustrated," "angry or provoked," "guilty," or if these persons made them "cry" or "got on their nerves." We coded items dichotomously to reflect whether an interaction had occurred with each of the four possible categories of persons (i.e., interactions with placed relative, staff, other residents, or families of other residents). To illustrate, a caregiver with a score of five positive interactions with staff would signify that the caregiver had experienced all five types of positive interactions with staff (i.e., confiding, reassuring, respect, laugh, and affectionate). Thus, we were able to assess the positive and negative interactions caregivers might have had with a variety of persons involved in the nursing home.Alphas for the measures of positive and negative interactions are as follows. Interactions with other residents: positive interactions variable discarded because of too few cases, negative interactions α = .79. Interactions with the families of other residents: positive interactions α = .78; negative interactions variable was discarded because of too few cases. Interactions with facility staff: positive interactions α = .65; negative interactions α = .79. Interactions with institutionalized relative: positive interactions variable discarded because of too few cases; negative interactions α = .80.The fourth domain of nursing home stress included three measures to assess whether caregivers performed any of 18 specific activities while visiting their family members (e.g., bring food, talk with relative, hold hands with relative, tidy relative's room; α = .66), the caregivers' visiting patterns (e.g., length of time visiting), and frequency of visits (e.g., daily, weekly).The fifth and final domain assessed how upset the caregivers were that their relative was in a nursing home. This single-item measure questioned caregivers about "how upsetting is it for you to see your relative in a nursing home" (very upsetting, somewhat upsetting, or not upsetting). Responses were coded so that higher scores indicated more stressful reactions (e.g., caregiver felt very upset seeing their relative in a nursing home).We measured caregiver depression using the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff 1977   ). This 20-item, 4-point scale covers the areas of depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, loss of energy, and disturbances of sleep and appetite (α = .88). The CES-D is designed to measure current state and has been used in numerous caregiving studies (Deimling 1991   ; Pruchno, Kleban, Michaels, and Dempsey 1990   ; Schulz and Williamson 1991   ). Scores of 16 or higher indicate significant depressive symptoms (Radloff and Teri 1986   ). Analytic Design and Procedures Given the large number of independent variables we wished to examine, we used a step-wise analysis strategy that entered variables by blocks consistent with the four conceptual domains. We carried over variables that were significant and included them in the next block of variables we entered. To determine the final regression predicting depression, we first considered the effects of secondary role strains (i.e., resident and caregiver adjustment to placement). As seen in  Fig. 1 , secondary role strains are viewed as being influenced by primary and nursing home stressors. Additionally, they have the potential to have an effect on each other and on caregiver depression. In designing our analyses, we chose to examine resident adjustment to placement first because of anecdotal evidence suggesting that caregivers' perception of how well their relative has adjusted to placement may influence how well caregivers react to the placement experience. In other words, we conceptualized resident adjustment as a predictor of caregiver adjustment rather than the reverse.As shown in the equation BC + PS + NHS = RA, for the first series of block-wise regressions, resident adjustment (RA) was regressed onto three blocks of variables consistent with the conceptual domains of background characteristics (BC), primary stressors (PS), and nursing home stressors (NHS). We carried over the significant predictors of resident adjustment from the first block (i.e., background characteristics) and included them in the next block of variables we entered (i.e., primary stressors). For example, because no background variables were significant predictors of resident adjustment, we did not include any in the next regression that added primary stressors. After we entered all blocks, we determined the model predicting resident adjustment.Next, we regressed caregiver adjustment (CgA) to placement onto three blocks of variables consistent with the conceptual domains of background characteristics (BC), primary stressors (PS), resident adjustment (RA), and nursing home stressors (NHS; BC + PS + RA + NHS = CgA). Similar to the regression predicting resident adjustment, no background characteristics were significant predictors of caregiver adjustment so that we did not carry over any to the next block that added primary stressors. We carried over significant primary stressors to the next regression that added resident adjustment and nursing home stressors as predictors of caregiver adjustment.The last blockwise analysis regressed caregiver depression (CgD) onto background characteristics (BC), primary stressors (PS), caregiver adjustment (CgA), and nursing home stressors (NHS; BC + PS + CgA + NHS = CgD). As with the previous models, we included any variables that were significant in the next block of variables to be added to the model. Using this method, we were able to develop systematically a model predicting caregiver depression that started with the influence of background characteristics on primary stressors, the effect of primary stressors and nursing home stressors on secondary role strains (i.e., resident and caregiver adjustment), and the final effects on caregiver depression. Results Caregiver and Resident Background Characteristics Residents were predominantly women (77.4%) and, on average, 84.1 years old (SD = 7.6, range 58 to 102 years;  Table 1  ). The mean number of months since the impaired adult had been placed was 34.9 (SD = 28.9, range less than 6 months to more than 6 years). Caregivers were predominantly women (69.9%), married (80.4%), Caucasian (83.5%), had not lived with their impaired family member prior to placement (63.2%), and, on average, were 60.5 years of age (SD = 13.7, range 34–90 years;  Table 2  ). Caregivers were most likely to be adult daughters or daughters-in-law of the impaired adult (48.9%), or spouses (18.1%), sons (18.0%), or other relatives or friends (15.0%). Nearly half the caregivers were employed either full time (30.1%) or part time (15.0%) while the remaining were retired (36.8%), homemakers (13.5%), or unemployed (4.5%). Primary Objective Stress On average, residents were fairly physically impaired (mean = 5.27, SD = 4.84) with over half never able to dress themselves (69%), to get out of the bed and/or chair (57%), or to move about their room (53%). About one-third or fewer demonstrated various problematic or disruptive behaviors (mean = 5.2, SD = 1.6) such as shouting or yelling (37%), hitting or slapping others (28%), moaning (27%), or biting or spitting (13%). Primary Subjective Stress On average, caregivers reported moderately low levels of care-related strain (mean = 13.8, SD = 4.4, range 0–23). Turning to the first of two measures of primary subjective stress that we added to the SPM, we found that caregivers reported fairly high levels of closeness (mean = 18.92, SD = 4.36, range 6–24). When asked if they had any difficulty with their relative's mental or emotional state, 33% of caregivers reported they had a great deal of difficulty, 44% had some difficulty, and 23% reported they had no difficulty. Secondary Role Strains Caregivers generally felt their relative's adjustment to the nursing home was positive. Specifically, one third responded that the relative's adjustment had been very good or excellent (34%), while the remainder rated the relative's adjustment as good (34%), fair (20%), or poor/very poor (11%). Similarly, the caregivers' perceptions of their own adjustment to the placement of their relative was found to be relatively positive. One third (34%) reported their adjustment had been very good or excellent, while 32% felt their adjustment had been good, 20% felt their adjustment had been fair, and 14% felt they had adjusted poorly or very poorly. Nursing Home Stressors Results for the first and second domains of nursing home stress (i.e., NAs' communication with and level of support of the caregivers), indicated that care-givers felt NAs were generally quite positive with them (mean = 9.9, SD = 2.2, range 2–12). Caregivers felt that NAs greeted them most of the time (86%), hardly ever acted rude or unpleasant (92%), and hardly ever ignored the caregiver (89%). Similarly, caregivers felt NAs were fairly supportive of them (mean = 6.3, SD = 2.8, range 0–10). For example, caregivers felt that most of the time NAs helped solve a question/concern the caregiver had (73%), helped the caregiver to know who to contact when a problem arose (69%), understood that it is stressful to have a relative in a nursing home (66%), and reassured the caregiver that the relative's behavior was not unusual (63%).The third and fourth domains assessed dimensions associated with personal interactions and experiences common to caregivers involved in placement settings (i.e., activities while visiting and positive and negative interactions with others at the facility). Results indicated that caregivers remained very involved in the care of their relatives after placement. Caregivers visited often, with most (45%) visiting two to five times per week while others visited three to four times per month (29%). During each visit to the facility, many caregivers spent 30 min to 1 hr (48%) while others stayed for a few hours (35%). When at the facility, nearly all caregivers (over 90%) talked with their relative, held hands, talked to RNs or LPNs, and/or talked to NAs. Over half (50%–89%) brought others to visit their relative, brought food, helped with personal care, took their relative for an outing, arranged for services, talked to social workers, tidied their relative's room, inventoried their clothing, and/or talked to other residents and their families.Given the amount of time spent at the nursing home, it is not surprising that caregivers were involved in both positive and negative interactions with others. Positive items reflected interactions with their relative, the staff, other residents, and the families of other residents that allowed the caregiver to confide in someone, to feel reassured or respected, to laugh, or to receive affectionate gestures. Negative interactions included those which made the caregiver cry, feel frustrated, guilty, or angry, or "got on their nerves." Caregivers had an average of 4.79 positive and 1.50 negative interactions with their relative, 6.41 positive and 1.42 negative interactions with facility staff, 1.91 positive and 2.5 negative interactions with other residents, and 2.34 positive and 2.25 negative interactions with other residents' family members. Nearly all caregivers (99%) had at least one positive interaction whereas 69% had at least one negative interaction. Overall, results indicated that caregivers experienced more positive (10.82) than negative (4.51) interactions with their relatives, staff, and others in the nursing home.The fifth and final dimension of nursing home stress examined how upset caregivers were at seeing their relatives in a nursing home. Nearly one third (30%) of the caregivers reported that they were not upset seeing their relative in a nursing home, nearly half (47%) reported feeling somewhat upset, and 23% were very upset at seeing their relative in a nursing home. Caregiver Depression We found levels of caregiver depression to be relatively low for this sample of "placement" caregivers (mean = 9.69, SD = 7.31, range 0–34). Over three quarters (79.8%) were under the CES-D cutoff of 16, reflecting that 20.2% reported symptoms of clinical depression. Multiple Regressions Predicting Resident Adjustment, Caregiver Adjustment, and Caregiver Depression Using multivariate ordinary least squares regression, we examined the predictors of resident adjustment to the nursing home, caregiver adjustment to the nursing home, and caregiver depression. As seen in  Table 3  , resident adjustment to the nursing home was predicted by the closeness of the relationship between the caregiver and resident, and nursing home stressors (R2 = .28, p < .0001). This regression analysis indicated that caregivers viewed their relatives as better adjusted if caregivers felt greater closeness to the relative (β = .23, p = .008), if caregivers and their relative had few negative interactions (β = −.28, p = .004), if caregivers and other residents had more negative interactions (β = .37, p = .000), and if caregivers felt less upset by seeing the relative in a nursing home (β = −.17, p = .099). Better resident adjustment was predicted by nursing home stressors as well. For example, residents were viewed as better adjusted by caregivers who felt the NAs offered more support to families (β = .21, p = .018).Predictors of family caregivers' adjustment (R2 = .28, p < .0001) included the resident's adjustment (β = .15, p < .10). In addition, caregivers who had little difficulty with their relative's mental and emotional state were more likely to adjust successfully (β = −.34, p = .001), as were caregivers who felt that NAs displayed higher levels of communication toward them (β = .30, p = .007).Finally, predictors of caregiver depression (R2 = .20, p < .001) included caregiver age (β = .19, p = .03) and adjustment to placement (i.e., caregivers who had adjusted poorly to the relative's placement were more depressed; β = −.18, p = .05). Caregivers who reported a higher frequency of negative interactions with their relatives were more likely to be depressed (β = .17, p = .04), as were caregivers who reported having difficulty with their relatives' mental and emotional state (β = .21, p = .04). In addition, caregiver depression was predicted by negative interactions with the families of other residents (β = .22, p = .007; see  Fig. 2 ). Discussion The present study examined the factors leading to caregiver depression in a sample of families with demented relatives residing in skilled nursing facilities. Our analytic approach demonstrated that the predictors of caregiver depression are connected to various components of the SPM of family caregiving. In the first step of this pathway, variables associated with the interpersonal relationship between the caregiver and resident (i.e., closeness, negative interactions, caregiver being upset seeing the relative in a nursing home) along with stressful characteristics of the nursing home (i.e., negative interactions with others) were predictive of resident adjustment to placement (i.e., secondary role strain). Next, we found that resident adjustment in combination with the caregiver's difficulty in dealing with the relative's mental state and the NAs' communication with the family (nursing home stressor) were predictive of caregiver adjustment to the relative's placement (i.e., secondary role strain). Lastly, the final outcome or consequence of caregiving, caregiver depression, was predicted by caregiver age, negative interactions between the caregiver and resident, the caregiver's difficulty with the relative's mental state, caregiver adjustment, and the caregiver's negative interactions with the families of other residents.These findings support the application of the SPM in this sample of "placement" caregivers. By adding conceptually relevant measures that reflected primary subjective stress, secondary role strain, and nursing home stress, we were able to demonstrate the utility of the SPM within the context of institutional care. For caregivers of a demented relative living in a nursing home, level of depression is closely linked to how well their relative adjusts to the nursing home environment. In turn, the relative's perceived adjustment is associated with the caregivers' reported adjustment to the nursing home. Moreover, adjustment of the relatives and caregivers is associated with specific nursing home stressors, which, in turn, play a role in the caregivers' level of depression. Thus, the relationship between caregivers and institutionalized relatives in combination with specific nursing home stressors are paramount to the adjustment of both residents and caregivers, which, in turn, are related to the caregivers' level of depression.It is interesting to note that the caregivers in this study had fairly low levels of depression (i.e., mean CES-D scores less than 10). This mean rate of depression is nearly half the level of previously reported CES-D rates for in-home caregivers (Whitlatch, Feinberg, and Sebesta 1997   ), yet comparable to other studies of the general adult population (e.g., mean CES-D scores ranging from 8.6 to 9.9; Linn, Dean, and Ensel 1986   ). Our sample's CES-D scores were also lower than scores reported in comparable studies of in-home caregivers with reported mean CES-D scores ranging from 14 to 18 (Cattanach and Tebes 1991   ; Deimling 1991   ; Pruchno et al. 1990   ). To date, no comparable studies of caregivers that have placed a demented relative have reported mean levels of depression using the CES-D.Surprisingly, the residents' physical functioning and problem behaviors (primary objective stressors) and the caregivers' visiting behavior (i.e., frequency of visits, activities performed while visiting) had no bearing on the caregivers' adjustment or depression. This finding supports previous research documenting that the change from in-home to institutional caregiving is marked by a decrease in primary stressors related to the impaired adult's functioning and hands-on care provided by the caregiver. Placement may alter the stressors caregivers experience but may also lead to the generation of new and potent caregiving stressors (Aneshensel et al. 1995   ; Zarit and Whitlatch 1992   ).These results point to the importance of interpersonal relationships and interactions within the nursing home environment. Recall that caregivers reported greater number of positive rather than negative interactions with staff and others in the facilities. Yet, negative interactions were more powerful predictors than positive interactions of resident and caregiver outcomes (i.e., adjustment and caregiver depression). The measures of positive and negative interactions were fairly simple suggesting that there is much to learn about the complex nature and potential stressfulness of interactions within nursing homes. The results indicate that compared to positive interactions, negative interactions have a greater impact on the well-being of both resident and caregiver. While this result may appear obvious, this study is the first to document its occurrence, suggesting that it may be more important to "eliminate the negative" rather than "accentuate the positive" within the context of family caregiving in a nursing home environment.An interesting and unexpected finding concerns the fact that caregivers who reported more negative feelings from interactions with other residents (e.g., frustration, annoyance, sadness) also reported that their impaired relative had adjusted better to the facility. It is possible that, within the context of having negative feelings from interactions with other residents, caregivers may form a more positive appraisal of their own relative's adjustment. A phenomenon similar to this has been reported in studies examining the influence of social comparisons as important predictors of well-being (Heidrich and Ryff 1993a   , Heidrich and Ryff 1993b   ). This body of work draws upon Rosenberg 1979    description of the mechanisms by which individuals give meaning to their experiences. Most appropriate to the current research is the principle of social comparisons whereby persons evaluate themselves through selected comparisons with others. In our work, we extend this idea to caregivers of nursing home residents who may evaluate their relative's well-being by comparing him or her to certain residents seen as "worse off" (downward comparison) than their relative. In turn, caregivers perceive their institutionalized family member as having adjusted better as compared to other residents in the facility.The relative strength of our single-item measures of resident and caregiver adjustment warrant discussion and further inquiry. One explanation for the strength of these preliminary constructs draws upon studies of older women that examine the reasons for and outcomes of relocation. Ryff and Essex 1992    suggest that specific aspects of well-being (e.g., purposefulness, continued development, positive self-regard, etc.) can be compromised when women relocate to settings that are discrepant with their reasons for moving; that is, "push–pull discrepancy." For example, a woman may consider relocating because of health problems, death of her significant other, loss of friends, or other "push factors." If she wishes, but is unable, to relocate to a place with health facilities and opportunities for social activities (i.e., "pull factors"), she will likely experience compromised well-being. For the present study, it may be that our exploratory dimension of resident and/or caregiver adjustment may touch upon this notion of "push–pull discrepancy." Caregivers may perceive themselves and/or their relative as poorly adjusted when they believe that their relative's relocation is discrepant with their reasons for the placement: "I wanted him to get three meals a day because he wasn't eating at home. Now he refuses to eat because the nursing home food doesn't taste like home cooking." Future research could expand upon these findings by exploring the specific components underlying perceived resident and caregiver adjustment.The caregivers' perceptions of the support provided by and communication with NAs were also important predictors of the adjustment of the resident and caregiver, respectively. Our research suggests that caregivers may depend on the information provided by NAs about the impaired relative in order to formulate their appraisal of the resident's adjustment to the facility. Comments by NAs such as "your relative's behavior is not uncommon" or "there's nothing to worry about," may help caregivers feel that their relative is doing well. Similarly, caregivers' perception of an "open line" of communication between themselves and the NA may help caregivers to adjust better to the stressful experiences of nursing home care. In either case, nursing home stressors are important and added components of the SPM that can have differential effects on the caregiver and resident.Although we were successful in adapting the SPM to this sample of placement caregivers, it is important to note three limitations of the study. First, many stress indicators described in the original model were not included in the interviews and analyses since the stress model was not used to guide the development of the original research. Key concepts, such as caregiver overload, were not included in the present study although a similar measure of "care-related strain" was found to be unrelated to adjustment and depression. We also had no exact measure of the loss of the relationship between caregiver and resident, although a similar measure of the current level of closeness was measured and found to be nonsignificant. Moreover, although single-item measures of adjustment were central to the results, future work will be needed to clarify the exact components and mechanisms underlying and defining resident and caregiver adjustment to placement. For example, is the better adjusted resident one who does not cry, is fairly active, and/or does not ask to go home? Is the well-adjusted caregiver one who is not consumed by their visits to the facility or who has become reintegrated into their larger social network in the community? These limitations mark a critical dilemma facing researchers who wish to apply the SPM to secondary analyses of existing data. Using secondary data to test a theoretical model that was not used to ground the initial study can lead to an inaccurate representation of the model's components. Although there may be missing pieces in our adapted SPM, the concepts we added fit well and our results proved promising.Second, the present study was cross-sectional, unlike the original methodology testing the SPM, which included five waves of data. Without longitudinal data it is difficult to say that the present results confirm that resident adjustment at Time 1 will affect caregiver adjustment at Time 2, which will affect caregiver depression at Time 3. As well, the specific nature of a causal relationship between adjustment and depression remains unclear. Depression in family caregivers prior to placing their relatives may have hindered the adjustment of both the caregiver and resident. We hope that these findings prompt further and more detailed inquiry into the longer term effects of "placement" caregiving.Third, it is important to recognize the potential limitations of the study's generalizability to the larger population of family caregivers. This sample consisted of caregivers who remained involved in the care of their placed relatives by visiting often and providing hands-on care. Residents were predominantly living in suburban facilities whose clients were predominantly white elderly. Compared to many previous studies, where reported samples consist predominantly of spouse caregivers, our sample is unusual in that most caregivers were adult daughters. It may be that sample recruitment from within a nursing home leads to samples of adult daughters rather than spouses. This is not to say that adult daughters are more likely to place a demented relative, although it is possible that the competing demands of work, family, and caregiving may lead daughters to place relatives earlier than spouses. The group may also be atypical of the larger population of caregivers of demented relatives who are unable to place their relatives because of inadequate financial resources or lack of adequate facilities. Our sample may be more representative of families where the placed relative is quite impaired as indicated by the inability to perform ADLs. Further research on placement caregivers will undoubtedly shed light on the mechanisms and timing of placement, which will increase the generalizability of findings.Recently, there has been increased interest in developing interventions for individuals caring for persons with dementia. While the effectiveness of these interventions has been criticized, improvements in design and methods of evaluation indicate the usefulness of focused caregiver interventions. It may prove helpful to caregivers if these interventions were further developed to address the issues of community-dwelling caregivers who continue to care for persons residing in nursing homes (e.g., support groups or counseling for caregivers throughout the various stages of the placement process). Past research indicates that the effects of placement are both short- and long-term suggesting that interventions should be designed to meet the changing needs of placement caregivers. A limited number of service agencies and nursing homes provide interventions to promote the adjustment and well-being of caregivers who have placed a relative, yet no empirical investigations have examined the effectiveness of these interventions. The results of the current study suggest that reducing caregiver depression is a multistage phenomenon influenced chiefly by the caregiver's own adjustment and the relative's adjustment to placement. The importance of negative relationships and interactions among caregivers, residents, and others at the nursing home are also paramount to the caregiver's adjustment and depression. Interventions that help eliminate or contain caregiving distress by focusing attention on caregivers' perceptions of the residents' adjustment may improve the well-being of placement caregivers.A final note concerns the importance of using secondary data to test current or emerging theories of caregiving stress. Rather than spend precious time and resources collecting new caregiving samples, researchers should consider adapting models such as the SPM to existing data sets. Our results suggest that the SPM is broad enough in its application that it can be used successfully with caregivers who have made the transition to institutional care. By adapting and expanding the model, we were able to confirm that nursing home stressors are critical to the adjustment of both the resident and caregiver and to the caregiver's level of depression. Research that builds upon and generates more detailed specificity of process and outcome holds great promise for advancing caregiving research and developing effective caregiver interventions.The ForumBook ReviewsPractice Concepts  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: Denmark is cited as a model in the development of home- and community-based systems for the frail elderly population. We examined the results of this natural experiment and considered implications for U.S. policy. Design and Methods: We used international comparative policy analysis, including site visits and semistructured interviews with Danish leadership in conjunction with a review of published literature, reports, and administrative data from Denmark and the United States. Results: After 12 years of implementing integrated systems for home- and community-based services in 275 municipalities, growth in Danish long-term care expenditures has leveled off; expenditures appear to be decreasing for the over-80 population and have dropped as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Access to and quality of long-term care services appear to remain generally satisfactory. During this period, comparable expenditures in the United States have increased, and deficits in access and quality persist. Implications: These findings should be of interest to state and federal policy makers considering strategies to reduce the rate of growth in Medicaid and Medicare expenditures for elders and to expand home- and community-based services.   Long-term care ,  Medicaid ,  Medicare Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDDespite considerable attention, the United States' ability to meet the long-term care needs of its aging population remains an issue of pressing national concern. Projections for the future, ranging from two to four times the current number of disabled elders by the middle of the century (Friedland and Summer 1999   ), have sparked debate regarding the magnitude of projected costs. Controversy also enshrouds the question of whether economic growth will be adequate to finance future costs and how to construct policies that maximize participation of elderly people in the labor force. However, no one argues that our current long-term care system is well suited to meet the needs of today's elders, let alone to address tomorrow's needs. Testifying before the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on Aging (Scanlon 1998   ), a senior official reported, "What we know today with some certainty is that the aging of the baby boomers will lead to a tremendous increase in the elderly population in the next 3 decades, with an even larger increase in individuals aged 85 and over, who are more likely to use long-term care services. What is less certain, however, is the nature, magnitude, and funding sources for those services. Financing these services—within the context of evolving service needs and alternatives—will be a challenge for the baby boomers, their families, and federal and state governments" (p. 2–3).Denmark has been widely recognized as a leader in care for its elderly population and is often cited as a model by European experts. In the context of considering policy alternatives for the United States, it may be useful to examine the results of the Danish expansion of home- and community-based services (HCBS). To better understand the history and structure of these Danish systems, we conducted a series of site visits and semistructured interviews with senior public health officials, providers, and economists in Denmark between 1995 and 1999. To determine outcomes for Danish HCBS, we reviewed published literature, program reports, and administrative data. Overview of the Danish System In the early 1980s Denmark began to face demographic trends not unlike those facing the United States today—increasing numbers of elderly people and a declining work force. At the time, Denmark relied heavily on an institutional system of care. By the mid 1990s there were extensive systems of HCBS available throughout the country; just under 29% of the elderly population were receiving some form of long-term care, and approximately 25% (one in four) of persons aged 67 and over were receiving home help (Danish Ministry of Finance 2000   ).The Danish system is based on a structure that goes back 100 years, when the local community, or "commune," was established as a local government with specific responsibilities. According to Henning Kirk, MD, who chaired several Danish commissions on long-term care (interview in Hellerup, Denmark, May 3, 1999), local political accountability to a population with an increasing proportion of elderly people means that municipal officials attach considerable importance to providing services to this important constituency. As we will explore, however, this alone does not ensure that all municipalities provide services to the satisfaction of all residents all of the time.Like other European countries, Denmark has a national health care system. Nearly all health and long-term care services are financed by general taxes, and all residents of Denmark are eligible for most of these services (Wagner 1997   ). According to a study conducted for the Economic Union (EU) by the London School of Economics, the level of satisfaction in Denmark with the health system is greater than in other EU countries, including France and Germany, which have much larger health care expenditures per capita (Danish Ministry of Health, 1997). Health care expenditures in Denmark (including long-term care) are currently 7.95% of the gross domestic product (GDP), with public expenditures accounting for 6.9% of GDP and private expenditures at 1.09% of GDP as compared to the United States, where health care accounts for 14% of GDP, with public expenditures 6.5% and private expenditures 7.5% (International Sammenligninger, 1999).Responsibility for health care services in Denmark is distributed among the three administrative levels of government: national, regional, and local. At the national level, the primary tasks are to initiate, coordinate, and supervise the health care system, including setting goals for national health policy. The Ministry of Health is responsible for legislation related to health care and controls the health care system mainly by issuing rules and guidelines. At the regional level, Denmark's 14 counties are responsible for hospitals and general practitioners. These responsibilities are financed mainly through county income taxes. At the local level, Denmark's 275 municipalities are responsible for nursing homes and home care services. They also finance their activities through income taxes and differ from each other in the proportion of resources that they devote to care for the elderly population, education, and other municipal services (Wagner 1997   ). Denmark's Expansion of Home Care In the early 1980s, in response to policy direction from the national government, local municipalities began to experiment with 24-hour home care services as an alternative to nursing homes. Services included home help (e.g., assistance with domestic tasks such as housecleaning) as well as nursing care. After-hours service for acute needs was provided in addition to regularly scheduled visits. By the mid 1980s, municipalities began to experiment with new forms of housing for disabled elders, emphasizing the development of various types of assisted living in lieu of new nursing home construction. In 1988, legislation was passed limiting the construction of new nursing homes (Pederson 1998   ), and remaining nursing homes were converted to single-occupancy rooms (personal communication, L. Wagner, April 4, 2000). Care was taken to minimize perverse financial incentives for institutionalization; individuals pay for housing and the government pays for necessary health and social services, regardless of the setting in which care is received (Hansen 2000   ). In 1997 another law mandated that all new housing for elders must have at least the following rooms: bedroom, sitting room, kitchen, and bath (personal communication, L. Wagner, April 4, 2000).The mid 1990s also saw widespread adoption of an approach referred to by the Danish as "the integrated care system." Where earlier, nursing homes and home care organizations were staffed separately, with the integrated care system only one organization cares for elderly and disabled people in a district (Hansen 2000   ). This organization provides the necessary services regardless of the type of housing. The integrated care system, which is now in use in approximately 75% of municipalities, was developed originally under the direction of Lis Wagner, RN, in Skaevinge, a small rural community north of Copenhagen (Wagner 1997   ).Skaevinge was one of the earliest and most successful of the Danish demonstration projects. Beginning in 1984, Skaevinge took what was, at the time, a radical approach. After an intensive planning process, this community decided to eliminate its one existing nursing home. The facility became a hub for community support services that include a senior center, day care, rehabilitation, 24-hour home care, and assisted living. Nursing home staff were guaranteed jobs in the new plan. During the transition process from nursing home to community care, staff had to learn to avoid taking over responsibility for tasks residents could do for themselves, and residents had to relearn self-care skills. The community was divided into three geographic service areas and staff were divided into three teams, each assigned to serve the residents of a given geographic area.Today, geographic integration of services facilitates transitions in the continuum of care. When an individual in Skaevinge becomes ill and requires closer supervision than can be provided in the home, she comes into the assisted living unit until well enough to go home. Similarly, someone who has been hospitalized may be discharged to the assisted living facility until able to go home. At night, a skeleton staff provides coverage for all three service areas. The staff believe that even severely demented residents function better in the company of less impaired individuals, so these residents live among others in the assisted living facility, although with special therapeutic services devoted to them (Wagner 1994   ; site visit and interview with L. Wagner and P. Poulson, Skaevinge, Denmark, May 4, 1999).Odense, known to Americans largely as the home of Hans Christian Andersen, is another of the communities that the Danes consider a model for HCBS. Odense, like Skaevinge, has eliminated its nursing homes. However, where Skaevinge converted the existing nursing home into an assisted living unit operated by the municipality, Odense entered into a partnership whereby private developers build and operate new assisted living units with the municipality providing the health and social support services. The assisted living facility in Odense provides a hub for community services including day care, rehabilitation, and 24-hour home care. As in Skaevinge, we observed demented patients living and eating next to the nondemented residents (Elderly Policy 1995   ; site visit to Odense, June 1995). Outcomes How successful have the Danes been in increasing access to HCBC? What has been the impact on costs and quality of care? As measures of access we consider increases in adaptive special dwellings (a new type of housing introduced in 1988 to replace nursing homes and older forms of municipal housing, consisting of apartments specifically adapted for the needs of older people), utilization of home help, and reductions in nursing home beds. As measures of quality, we consider consumer satisfaction. To assess the relative growth in expenditures between Denmark and the United States we compare total expenditures (i.e., both public and private expenditures) for nursing homes and home health care between 1985 and 1997. To determine whether change has occurred in the amount each nation is spending on such care in relation to the size of the economy, we compare total expenditures as a percentage of GDP in 1985 and 1997. Finally, to determine whether differences in total long-term care spending might be explained by differences in the number of elderly individuals or the proportion of the population that has become "old elderly" (i.e., those with the highest use rates for long-term care), we calculate a ratio using total expenditures as the numerator with the number of people aged 65+ and 80+ as the denominator.In some instances we compare Danish outcomes and cost with those reported in U.S. studies to provide a context for the reader. Such comparisons must be viewed with caution. Outcomes and costs are best evaluated within a culture and service delivery system (Perrin, Durch, and Skillman 1999   ). Comparisons between the United States and other nations are fraught with difficulties. Not only do patterns of illness vary, even between different states in the United States, but the structure of medical and social service systems differs as well. Thus, comparisons are based on available, rather than strictly comparable, data. Access Between 1985 and 1997, the number of nursing home beds in Denmark decreased 30% (Hansen 2000   ), whereas nursing home beds in the United States increased 12% (National Center for Health Statistics 2000   ). As shown in  Table 1  , the number of individuals older than age 65 in Denmark remained stable at 15% during this period, whereas the proportion in the United States rose from 11.9% to 12.8%. In Denmark, the number of beds per thousand people aged 65 and over decreased 32% compared to a 7% decrease in the United States. The proportion of very old (80+) individuals increased in both countries by about 25%. Thus, although Denmark started with a larger percentage of elderly people, the growth of the very old, in those most likely to require long-term care, has been comparable. In Denmark, the number of beds per thousand people aged 80 and older decreased 45%, compared to a 21% decrease in the United States.The decrease in Danish nursing home beds was accompanied by an increase in adapted dwellings for elders and in the use of home help. Between 1985 and 1998 the number of sheltered housing and other adapted dwellings in Denmark increased 331%, from 9,622 to 31,854. Although it is unknown how many of these dwellings are staffed with personal care or health care professionals, Danish experts estimate that the majority of them are not. Residents rely on the 24-hour home care service as needed. The percentage of people aged 67 and older receiving home help increased from 19% to 25%. A major increase occurred in the percentage of people receiving fewer than 4 hours of home help per week (185%), but the percentage of people receiving 4–6.9 hours per week decreased. This shift occurred as Danish municipalities gave priority to providing assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs), such as getting in and out of bed, dressing, and bathing, and reduced the time available for housework and shopping. The percentage of people receiving 13 or more hours of help increased by 196%, reflecting the greater level of need in the community due to the shift in housing policy and, possibly, some decrease in care provided by families (Hansen 2000   ).In comparison with other European countries, Denmark provides the most home care, providing on average nearly twice as many hours of home help for all individuals older than age 65 as its closest competitor, Sweden. Net spending on care services for elders was comparable between Denmark and Sweden in 1995, with Sweden spending a far larger percentage of these funds on institutional care (Danish Ministry of Finance 2000   ). However, while all citizens of Denmark may have access to long-term care, the mix and cost of services provided in different municipalities varies substantially (Copenhagen Post 2000   ; Hansen 2000   ). Some municipalities have attempted to cut back on services to elders, relenting only when forced by litigation (Copenhagen Post 1999   ).An important dimension of access in the Danish system is the letter that goes to all Danes at age 75, offering them a home visit. The Home Prevention Act mandates home visits twice a year for elders, regardless of their health status. Through these home visits, health professionals promote access to appropriate services and increase the probability that Danish elders will know where to turn if they have problems or questions and that they will be aware of the services available to them. Quality of Services As Denmark reduced access to nursing homes, the major concern was whether new housing modalities and home care services could keep pace with the needs of an increasing number of disabled elders. Evaluations from some of the earliest experiments with 24-hour home care indicate that these services increased older people's sense of security (Hansen and Werborg 1984   ). A study conducted at the end of the 1980s (Pedersen 1992   ) reported that a marked shift in attitude had occurred in attitudes toward aging, with people showing "an optimistic and self-confident attitude to their own old age." More recent evaluation studies do not indicate a decline in overall consumer satisfaction with long-term care services available to elders (Pederson 1998   ), and users generally feel they receive enough help with personal care and home nursing (Hansen and Platz 1995   ).Despite this generally positive assessment, there is widespread recognition that the quality of long-term care varies among the municipalities. In areas where the level of home help has been reduced, a significant number of residents express dissatisfaction with the amount of help available for domestic tasks such as housecleaning (Hansen and Platz 1995   ). As opposed to other European countries, individuals receiving permanent home help pay no user fees, and this benefit is not means tested (Danish Ministry of Finance 2000   ). Nonetheless, efforts to introduce private payment for practical home help services have been controversial. Daneage, an advocacy group for the elderly population, takes credit for helping block such a policy change in 1999. It successfully took three cases to court where a municipality had cut back on practical home help services for a disabled elderly individual; also, it advocates increasing the availability of nursing homes for elders who might prefer this mode of care (Daneage 2000   ). In response to widespread criticism of the amount and quality of home help given to elderly people, the right to appeal has been enhanced. Since 1996, municipalities have been required to explicitly define the service package available locally, develop service specifications, and set up local boards to hear complaints (Pederson 1998   ).Danish experts indicate that the municipality of Skaevinge continues to serve as a model, citing a recent evaluation of the Skaevinge project from its inception in 1984 to 1997. This study reports high levels of satisfaction among residents and staff, improvements in both self-reported and actual health status, and reductions in hospitalizations, particularly among the "old elderly." The proportion of individuals rating their health as better than average (when compared to their peers) rose from 29% in 1985 to 41% in 1997. This improvement in self-rated health scores is mirrored by a statistically significant decline in the number of elders with diagnosed circulatory disorders. The proportions of older people reporting dependence in ADLs (walking, toileting, dressing) remain unchanged although there is an improvement in the proportion who report that they can cut their own nails, pick up shoes from the floor, prepare their own food, and do their own laundry (Knudsen, Christensen, Friis, and Wagner 1999   ). In summary, the picture from this study is one of an elderly population whose health status has improved somewhat and whose physical capacities are largely unchanged from those of an earlier cohort, but who appear more satisfied with their health and are more confident of their abilities. Given the many factors that can affect health status, these improvements cannot be attributed solely to the provision of HCBS. Nonetheless, the shift from nursing homes to HCBS cannot be said to have undermined the health status of elders in Skaevinge. Costs of HCBS What has been the impact of the Danish shift toward HCBS on total long-term care spending? Between 1985 and 1995, total long-term care expenditures as a percentage of GDP dropped from 2.4% to 2.2% of GDP for the Danes (an 8% decline), whereas in the United States total long-term care expenditures as a percentage of GDP increased from 1.03% to 1.59% (a 54% increase). Note that although the proportion of elders in the U.S. population increased as opposed to Denmark, where it remained stable, the increase of less than 8% in the proportion of elders cannot account for the magnitude of the expenditure increase.During this same period the ratio of total expenditures to the population aged 65+ increased 8% for the Danes, whereas in the United States the ratio of total expenditures to population 65+ increased 67% (see  Table 1  ). The percentage change in spending is most striking in reference to the population aged 80+, the segment of the population that is most at risk for nursing home care. Between 1985 and 1997, Denmark achieved a 12% reduction in the proportion of long-term care expenditures to the population aged 80+. By contrast, the United States realized a 68% increase. In 1985 the ratio of Denmark's long-term care expenditures to the population aged 80+ was nearly twice that of the United States ($16,811 for Denmark compared to $8,949 for the U.S.). However, by 1997 this ratio was similar for both countries ($14,818 for Denmark compared to $15,008 for the U.S.).Careful consideration to the comparability of the expenditures between the two countries is warranted. Whenever an accounting construct is designed, it is important to understand what is measured, the data sources, and methods used (National Health, 2000). All expenditures have been adjusted to 1997 dollars to control for inflation. Our estimates for both countries include durable medical supplies and equipment and nursing home expenditures for the nonelderly disabled as well as the elderly populations. We have excluded from U.S. long-term care estimates Medicare expenditures for hospital-based skilled nursing facilities, because these facilities largely provide care relating to acute illness, and comparable patients in Denmark would remain in the hospital. The value of time spent on caring by informal caregivers is excluded from both the Danish and U.S. expenditures.Danish figures for home care exclude the estimated costs for services to nonelderly disabled individuals. Consequently, we have excluded Medicaid payments for personal care and for home- and community-based waiver services from our calculations. Although in a few states these programs are a significant source of home care for elders, we chose to omit them from our comparison because available U.S. data for 1997 do not differentiate Medicaid expenditures by age for these services. If we adjust U.S. 1997 data proportionately, using data from 1995 (Wiener and Stevenson 1998   ), long-term care expenditures for the United States would increase by about 1%.U.S. home health care expenditures are from the U.S. National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHE), which define home health care services (National Health 2000b   ) as "medical services delivered in the home by private and public nonfacility-based home health agencies." The NHE include Medicare, Medicaid, and private expenditures with certain exceptions. Medicare hospital-based home health expenditures are not included, nor are other public expenditures for home care that are channeled through programs that do not have the provision of care or treatment of disease as their primary focus. Thus, expenditures for nonmedical home care services such as housecleaning, meals on wheels, chore-worker services, or other custodial services for disabled elders that are publicly funded through Title XX of the Social Security Act, the Older Americans Act (Administration on Aging 2000   ), or with state, county, or local appropriations are excluded from U.S. estimates; however, comparable services would be included in the Danish estimates. These expenditures are relatively small and, if included, would increase estimates of U.S. total long-term care expenditures by about 3%. Discussion and Implications for the United States It appears that Denmark's relatively small size, historic commitment to elder care, and political decentralization have provided a natural experiment in the development of efficient and "consumer friendly" HCBS for the elderly population. These findings can have important implications for the United States, where fragmentation of financing makes evaluation of HCBS problematic. As a recent report from the ASPE Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy (Doty 2000   ) noted, "It is difficult—indeed it is virtually impossible—to design and conduct research that truly measures cost-effectiveness as distinct from cost-shifting from one program to another, from state to Federal funds, and from formal to informal care" (p. 11). A number of states have implemented HCBS (see Leutz 1999   , for a review), and there is evidence that some of these may have produced savings (Alecxih, Lutzky, and Corea 1996   ; Bodenheimer 1999   ; U.S. General Accounting Office 1994   ; Weissert, Lesnick, Musliner, and Foley 1997   ). A few states have begun to emphasize construction of alternative residential facilities in place of nursing homes (U.S. General Accounting Office 1994   ). However, because of the fragmentation in reimbursement, eligibility, and services for long-term care in the United States (Boult and Pascala 1999   ), American elders do not receive the security afforded by the Danish system. As Feder 1999    aptly sums up the U.S. situation, "In long-term care, there is no ‘system’; almost nobody has protection" (p. 4).Between 1985 and 1997, total expenditures for home care in the United States rose 470%, from $5.6 billion to $32.3 billion. Public expenditures for home care provided by Medicare and Medicaid grew 611%, from $2.5 billion to $17.7 billion (NHE 2000   ). Despite the enormous growth in U.S. home care expenditures, many disabled elders lack the services they need. In contrast to the relatively positive assessment of Danish personal care and home health services, a recent study reports that nearly half of home care clients in the United States receive only some or none of the support services they need. Necessary services are not provided for several reasons: because they are not reimbursable; the demand for services exceeds supply; physicians who write the home care orders are unaware of all the patient's needs; or the hospital discharge planners have not arranged for the proper mix of services (Thomas and Payne 1998   ).One frequently cited reason for not making home care more accessible in the United States is the "woodwork effect," that is, the argument that if home care is offered as an alternative to nursing homes, more people will demand care and "community-based services are unlikely to save money, because the demand for these services will drown any unit cost savings" (Kane, Kane, Ladd, and Veazie 1998   , p. 364). The Danish experience is particularly interesting in this context because it would appear to represent a "worst case scenario" with regard to the woodwork effect. Among European countries, Denmark is noted for the independence of its elders—only 3% of those over age 70 live with their children (Kahler 1992   ). Although studies have found that up to 60% of Danish older people receive some form of help from relatives, friends, and neighbors, this is rarely the sole source of care (Hansen and Platz 1995   ). In Denmark, private expenditures for long-term care are very modest. Few people hire private assistance for home care, as these services are supplied without user payment. User copayments in nursing homes are also low, about 2.5% of total income for these institutions in 1997 (E. B. Hansen, personal communication, April 6, 2000).By contrast, in the United States, 46% of home health care and 38% of nursing home care are paid for out of private funds (NHE 2000   ). Approximately one third of people discharged from nursing homes pay with private funds when admitted but eventually spend down to Medicaid eligibility (Wiener, Sullivan, and Skaggs 1996   ). Among elders with functional limitations who live in the community, 90% receive some informal care and 65% depend solely on help from family and friends (Scanlon 1998   ). This help is often provided at considerable personal and financial cost to the caregiver as well as to the employer. One recent study (Schulz and Beach 1999   ) found that participants who were providing care and experiencing caregiver strain had mortality risks that were 63% higher than noncaregiving controls. The value of time devoted to informal caregiving in 1997 was estimated at $196 billion (Arno, Levine, and Memmott 1999   ).Time devoted to caring for parents substantially reduces the labor supply for both men and women (Johnson and Lo Sasso 2000   ). This factor was noted as a consideration in the Danish policy shift toward HCBS by several of the Danish experts we interviewed, and it has substantial implications for the United States as well. As declining mortality rates increase the number of older people, especially the "old elderly," it is anticipated that declining fertility rates will reduce the number of children who will be available to care for their aging parents. At the same time, women at midlife, who have traditionally been the primary caregivers for frail elders, are participating in the labor force in increasing numbers (Friedland and Summer 1999   ; Johnson and Lo Sasso 2000   ). Unless efficient services for HCBS can be developed in the United States, these trends will create enormous pressure on future financing of long-term care as increased demand for institutional long-term care results in concomitant increases in expenditures (Friedland and Summer 1999   ). Conclusion In 1985, Denmark was spending considerably more per capita on long-term care than was the United States. However, by 1997 Danish and U.S. per capita expenditures for the elderly population appear to be roughly comparable. U.S. growth in long-term care expenditures during the past 15 years has occurred despite the fact that cost containment has been a major priority for state governments, as it continues to be today (Wiener and Stevenson 1998   ). Currently, there is reason for concern that Medicare cutbacks in home health care will further fuel increases in state Medicaid costs (Kenney, Rajan, and Soscia 1998   ). In this context, the results of the Danish experience—that growth in expenditures has leveled off, expenditures have dropped as a percentage of GDP, and expenses appear to be decreasing for the over-80 population—are especially noteworthy for state leadership. Rather than discouraging further experimentation with HCBS and alternative residential housing for elders, the Danish experience suggests that these approaches can be successful in controlling costs for long-term care as well as increasing security for older people and their families. This experience may give some comfort to state policy makers as they grapple with the expansion of Medicaid HCBS mandated by the decision in Olmstead v. L.C. (Supreme Court of the United States 1999   ).We do not suggest that the Danish model for HCBS can or should be transplanted directly into the United States. Although Denmark's development of comprehensive services to elders is impressive (without the impediment of the fractured funding and cost-shifting that so marks the U.S. health care system), the variation in services offered by Danish municipalities mirrors some of the variations in our own state Medicaid programs. Concerns expressed over attempts to cut back on housekeeping services to Danish elders, or to privatize these services, may seem trivial when contrasted with the problems U.S. elders have in obtaining home nursing and personal care; however, it should be kept in mind that the "welfare state" ideology and egalitarian income structure in Denmark leave many elders with little discretionary income. In short, the issue of preserving individual freedom and autonomy for older people while optimizing resource allocation remains a difficult challenge for the United States and Denmark alike. It is in this context that we suggest that the Danish experience belies the common belief in U.S. health policy circles that HCBS can not be cost-effective. In addition, municipalities such as Skaevinge offer models not only in how services in an efficient system might be structured, but in how the transition process from institutional to community-based care can be successfully managed. We hope that consideration of the Danish experience will encourage and inform the efforts of U.S. policy makers to develop new and better systems of care for older Americans, even as they struggle with the ongoing need to contain costs.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: In published dementia caregiver intervention research, there is widespread failure to measure the level at which treatment was implemented as intended, thereby introducing threats to internal and external validity. The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of inducing and assessing treatment implementation (TI) strategies in caregiving trials and to propose Lichstein's TI model as a potential guide. Design and Methods: The efforts of a large cooperative research study of caregiving interventions, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH), illustrates induction and assessment of the three components of TI: delivery, receipt, and enactment. Results: The approaches taken in REACH vary with the intervention protocols and include using treatment manuals, training and certification of interventionists, and continuous monitoring of actual imple-mentation. Implications: Investigation and description of treatment process variables allows researchers to understand which aspects of the intervention are responsible for therapeutic change, potentially resulting in development of more efficacious and efficient interventions.   Treatment implementation ,  Alzheimer's caregiving ,  Interventions Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDIt is estimated that 4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), with 80% of these individuals living at home and being cared for by family caregivers (Czaja, Eisdorfer, and Schulz 2000   ). The number of people with ADRD is expected to grow exponentially as the U.S. population ages (Schulz and O'Brien 1994   ). Potential stressors associated with family caregiving are numerous and can include managing behavioral disturbances, attending to physical needs, and providing seemingly constant vigilance (Gold et al. 1995   ; Vitaliano, Russo, Young, Teri, and Maiuro 1991   ; Wright, Clipp, and George 1993   ). The effects of these stressors on family caregivers can be catastrophic. Family caregiving has been associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety as well as higher use of psychoactive medications, poorer self-reported physical health, compromised immune function, and increased mortality (Light, Niederehe, and Lebowitz 1994   ; Schulz and Beach 1999   ; Schulz, O'Brien, Bookwala, and Fleissner 1995   ).Over the past 20 years, researchers have examined a plethora of psychosocial interventions aimed at alleviating distress associated with dementia caregiving. Intervention programs have included intensive personalized counseling, supportive group counseling, providing knowledge about ADRD through educational programs, specific therapeutic skills training, enhancing problem-solving skills, and teaching behavior management techniques (see reviews by Bourgeois, Schulz, and Burgio 1996   ; Kennet, Burgio, and Schulz 2000   ; Knight, Lutzky, and Macofsky-Urban 1993   ; Toseland and Rossiter 1989   ; Zarit and Teri 1992   ). The conclusions from these reviews are varied. However, there is a growing consensus in the literature that interventions that are comprehensive, intensive, and individually tailored to caregivers' needs are likely to be more effective than those lacking these characteristics (Haley, Ehrbar, and Schonwetter 1997   ; Kennet et al. 2000   ; Mittelman, Ferris, Shulman, Steinberg, and Levin 1996   ).Another conclusion of these reviews is that existing dementia caregiving intervention studies are fraught with methodological weaknesses that present threats to their internal validity, that is, their ability to infer that the intervention was related to therapeutic changes in caregiver and care recipient outcomes. These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the use of weak experimental designs, problematic sampling and randomization strategies, and the use of inadequate outcome measures. In their review, Bourgeois and colleagues 1996    focused on the importance of describing treatment process variables and the lack of attention caregiving intervention researchers have devoted to describing these variables.The investigation and description of treatment process variables allows researchers to understand which aspects of the intervention are responsible for therapeutic change; this, in turn, can result in the development of more efficacious and efficient interventions. Much has been written over the past two decades on the therapeutic process, particularly surrounding psychotherapy outcome research. Early writings by Cook and Campbell 1979    and Sechrest and colleagues (Sechrest, West, Phillips, Redner, and Yeaton 1979   ; Sechrest and Yeaton 1981   ) helped focus researchers' attention on critical process variables such as the quality of the therapeutic relationship (therapeutic alliance), the level of therapist skill, and treatment dosage. However, the sine qua non of investigating treatment process variables is the description in precise terms of what the intervention involved (i.e., the treatment components) and establishing through empirical means that the intervention was presented as intended. This is commonly referred to as establishing treatment integrity. In the absence of assessing treatment integrity, conclusions regarding treatment efficacy cannot be made with any confidence (Sechrest et al. 1979   ; Sechrest and Yeaton 1981   ).However, over the past decade clinical researchers have come to recognize that establishing treatment integrity (i.e., that the treatment was delivered as intended), though necessary, is insufficient for asserting that an unbiased test of the treatment was conducted. The participant's mastery of treatment (termed receipt) and the participant's application of treatment beyond the boundaries of the therapy session (termed enactment) are no less critical (Lichstein, Riedel, and Grieve 1994   ). Thus, the path of the independent variable (treatment) has been partitioned into three components—delivery, receipt, and enactment—and their summative impact on the client has been termed treatment implementation (TI).The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of assessing and reporting treatment implementation in dementia caregiver intervention research. Although we focus on caregiver interventions, these issues have relevance to all geriatric intervention research (e.g., comprehensive geriatric assessment, psychosocial nursing home interventions). We propose Lichstein's TI model (Lichstein et al. 1994   ) as a means of conducting unbiased tests of intervention efficacy, and we describe the efforts of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) cooperative group to apply this model in ongoing caregiver intervention trials. Lichstein's approach was chosen because it is the only existing system for evaluating treatment along its entire path from presentation to the client to the client's use of treatment in the natural environment. Treatment Implementation TI strategies are used to facilitate and monitor activities between two actors, the interventionist and the client, so that the action of an intervention can be understood. Typically, the term treatment implementation refers to a class of strategies to document the implementation of individual treatment components.TI strategies can be classified according to three fundamental aspects of intervention application: delivery, receipt, and enactment (Lichstein et al. 1994   ). Treatment delivery targets the actions of the interventionist, specifically his or her ability to present the intervention to the client as intended. The focus here is on the therapist's therapeutic skills and his or her ability to engage the client in the treatment protocols. Thus, delivery is concerned with including all intended parts of the treatment, but also with excluding inadvertent introduction of parts of other treatments.Treatment receipt refers to the degree to which the client actually received the intended treatment, as indicated by mastery of concepts and/or skill development. The focus of treatment receipt is on the client's actions, for example, the extent of the client's knowledge or skill level in the area being targeted.Treatment enactment targets the degree to which the client demonstrates changes in therapeutic behaviors related to the intervention in the natural environment, that is, does the client use appropriately, in his or her daily life, the skills and knowledge that define the particular intervention? In theory, enactment should be closely associated with desired treatment outcomes, but it is important to note that enactment indicators are distinct from the primary outcomes of the study.Lichstein and associates 1994    differentiated between strategies that are used to induct and those used to assess TI. Induction refers to the methods researchers use to enhance the probability that proper TI occurs. Assessment refers to either quantitative or qualitative measurement of their occurrence. This distinction is important because clinical researchers can use several TI strategies but might assess only a portion of those strategies (Lichstein et al. 1994   ). TI Induction. Formal and informal induction methods for delivery, receipt, and enactment should be instituted on an ongoing basis to help ensure appropriate implementation of the intervention. One mechanism for ensuring appropriate and accurate delivery is the use of a detailed written treatment protocol. Other induction procedures include didactic instruction, role playing, performance feedback, and discussions of each of the interventions and how they differ during structured therapist training and recalibration sessions.Although delivery induction is aimed at improving interventionist skills, receipt and enactment induction focus on encouraging the client's understanding and performance of therapeutic skills. Receipt and enactment induction methods include instructions and reminders by the interventionist to use the treatment components. Other methods include written materials related to the intervention, role playing, and performance feedback provided to the client during therapeutic sessions. TI Assessment. Unlike data obtained from study outcome measures, information from TI assessments is collected continuously and is inspected and interpreted as part of the ongoing intervention. Direct measures of client performance of intervention components yield more reliable judgments than indirect measures but are generally more difficult to obtain. Direct measures are more common in delivery and receipt assessments, whereas enactment assessment often relies more strongly on indirect assessment.Delivery assessment focuses on the skills of the interventionist and his or her ability to deliver the intervention as intended, without additions, and within the amount of time allotted for the intervention. Direct measures of delivery include the frequency, format, and content of all interactions between interventionist and client. One standard methodology for directly assessing delivery is to specify the components of the intervention that are intended, along with plausible confounding components that should not occur, and rating the interventionist on the basis of the occurrence of each. One method for assessing delivery is to obtain independent ratings of an intervention session, using audio- or videotapes or an observer.Treatment receipt is often assessed by documenting the client's knowledge or skill level, frequently through the use of pen-and-paper surveys or questionnaires. However, for clients who have low literacy, some direct methods of assessing intervention receipt, such as written tests of knowledge or understanding, may be burdensome or impossible. Other direct measures of receipt that are less obtrusive than written measures include asking the client to demonstrate a skill or asking him or her to recall intervention suggestions. Two "soft" indirect measures of treatment receipt, often used as the sole measures of receipt, are to confirm that the client has the intervention materials in his or her possession and to ask if he or she has any questions about the intervention. Direct and indirect measures of treatment receipt can be scored by the interventionist or by an independent rater, again using tapes or observation.Assessment of enactment is more difficult but critical to establishing the internal validity of an intervention. Written self-reports of client use of therapeutic components provide a direct assessment of enactment; however, as in receipt assessment, these may prove difficult for clients with low literacy. Indirect assessment of enactment is more common and can include questioning the client regarding the use of intervention techniques. Enactment assessment is more commonly completed by the interventionist but can be scored by an independent observer.TI assessment provides information concerning the process of treatment as the study unfolds. It provides critical information to the investigator regarding the current state of the intervention protocol and creates the opportunity for corrective action if the interventionist "drifts" from the treatment protocol. Such assessments can also be useful in determining why an intervention did or did not achieve the desired outcomes with specific individuals.Strategies to induce and assess treatment delivery, receipt, and enactment must be customized to the specific intervention. In the remainder of the article we use examples from the six REACH intervention projects to illustrate several approaches, as well as complications, to TI induction and assessment. However, before we describe specific TI strategies, we present a brief general description of the REACH cooperative effort. A more detailed description can be found in Coon, Schulz, and Ory 1999   . REACH REACH is a unique, 5-year program sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute for Nursing Research. REACH grew out of a National Institutes of Health initiative that acknowledged the well-documented burdens associated with dementia caregiving, as well as the emergence in the literature of promising dementia caregiver interventions. In 1995, NIH funded six intervention sites and a coordinating center to develop interventions for family caregivers of individuals at the moderate level of impairment (see  Appendix ). Each site investigated a different intervention, although there were commonalities in the treatment components used across sites. The sites investigated the following Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver interventions: (a) home-based behavioral skills training and problem solving (Birmingham/Tuscaloosa), (b) telephone-based system offering voice mail support and advice (Boston), (c) training in behavior and stress management provided through a primary care setting (Memphis), (d) home-based, family-focused multisystem intervention with computer–telephone integration (Miami), (e) group-based coping skills training and enhanced support (Palo Alto), and (f) home-based environmental and behavioral skills training (Philadelphia). Because the caregiving experience in ethnic minority families has been particularly neglected in the field, all of the sites included substantial minority participation. The cooperative agreement fostered the development of standardized outcome measures to assess the impact of comparable strategies on caregivers and their care recipients and the creation of a common database to help compare the efficacy of these different interventions across the range of identified populations. REACH TI Strategies Strategies to Induce and Assess Treatment Delivery Accurate and consistent delivery of the intended treatment is critical to intervention effectiveness as well as to the interpretation of both significant and null findings. Although few will disagree with this fundamental statement, mechanisms to ensure the accurate and consistent delivery of a treatment protocol can be difficult to achieve and are often omitted by investigators. Common induction and assessment strategies used in the REACH projects were designed to combat potential threats to delivering treatment as intended.  Table 1  shows some of the induction and assessment strategies used in the initiative. Many of the strategies used in REACH served both induction and assessment functions.There are multiple threats to consistency of inducing treatment delivery, particularly in large, complex intervention trials. For example, all of the REACH interventions included multiple treatment components. Ensuring consistent, accurate application by an interventionist of a single component intervention (e.g., imparting knowledge about ADRD) was simpler than an intervention involving knowledge plus behavioral skills training. Similarly, the complexities of treatment delivery assessment multiply as a function of the number of interventions being compared in a multisite trial. Length of intervention is also a factor. Some of the REACH sites extended their intervention phase over 12 months or longer. It is not uncommon for interventionists to drift from intervention protocol when lengthy intervention phases are used (Moncher and Prinz 1991   ). Moreover, although the use of multiple interventionists is advisable to control for "extratherapeutic" factors (e.g., therapist personality), therapist attrition during multiyear therapy trials presented complications for ensuring consistent treatment delivery throughout the trial.Strategies to induce (i.e., enhance) and assess treatment delivery included (a) using treatment manuals, (b) interventionist training and certification, and (c) providing monitoring and feedback on performance. Each is discussed below. Treatment Manuals. To guarantee a consistent level of accuracy in treatment delivery, all REACH interventions were guided by detailed treatment manuals. Each of the manuals was examined by the coordinating center for consistency across sites in format and level of detail. These extensive manuals described all aspects of treatment delivery and assessment. Manuals were used as training tools and to maintain accurate delivery over time. Interventionists were given a treatment manual that provided a detailed account of each treatment component and a step-by-step timeline to ensure timely delivery of all intervention activities. In many of the sites, therapists also carried into each session treatment delivery checklists to remind them of the necessary treatment components. Manuals were also a convenient and accurate source of guidance regarding special circumstances that might occur during intervention. Structured Training and Certification. Methodical interventionist training is a critical step to ensure accurate delivery of treatment. A formal procedure for training interventionists was developed by the investigators at each site. Training consisted of independent readings, didactic instruction, hands-on demonstration, and performance feedback to enable interven-tionists to implement treatment with AD caregivers. Training was followed by an evaluation procedure, supervised by the coordinating center, that certified the individual to serve as an interventionist. Interventionists were provided with certificates acknowledging that they had acquired the skills necessary for delivering the intervention. Ongoing Monitoring and Feedback. Although certification procedures confirmed that interventionists had a standardized level of expertise prior to delivering interventions, ongoing monitoring of the interventionists' performance during the trial was critical. Thus, all REACH sites conducted periodic assessments of the interventionists' performance. This was accomplished largely by audiotaping interactions with caregivers, either at every therapeutic session or on a random basis. These audiotaped interactions were coded by an individual at the site who was knowledgeable about the intervention to ensure accurate and consistent adherence with protocol. Coding of each interventionist's performance was guided by a treatment delivery and accuracy checklist on which the coder rated the interventionist's performance according to previously identified key treatment components. The completed checklist was then used to provide feedback to the interventionist on accuracy of performance. Thus, both the therapist and the supervisory checklists were used for delivery induction and assessment.In addition, some REACH sites incorporated the practice of weekly group supervision sessions to allow very careful and consistent feedback and monitoring of their interventionists. This was done particularly at sites where multiple and, at times, rotating interventionists (e.g., psychological interns) were used, to ensure that treatments were delivered in a consistent manner by all involved throughout the life of the project. As an example, three of the sites used a similar "minimal support condition" (MSC). In this condition, therapists contacted caregivers by telephone to offer limited social support; however, only very general therapeutic information was provided. In the MSC, the handling of serious issues (such as possible elder abuse) often required a delicate balance between the constraints of the protocol itself and the ethical mandate to respond appropriately to the problem under discussion. In group supervision, all current interventionists and those in training would discuss possible ways to handle a situation, and a plan of action would be agreed on and followed up on. For those sites that used group supervision, attendance was required for all staff, including those functioning in outlying areas who were connected by phone to the face-to-face weekly group meetings. To increase the consistent application of the MSC protocol across sites, the project managers from each site participated in regular phone conferences where problems in delivery were discussed. Cultural Diversity and Language Issues in Treatment Delivery. Four of the six REACH sites heavily recruited African American caregivers (Birmingham/Tuscaloosa, Boston, Memphis, and Philadelphia), and two focused on Hispanic/Latino caregivers (Miami and Palo Alto). Diversity issues were often complex and required special attention. At those sites serving the Hispanic/Latino populations, language issues—notably language preference and translation issues—added to the complexity of delivering the REACH interventions as intended. We raise this issue, and describe experiences handling it, to alert other researchers to some important considerations as it is anticipated that in the future more intervention programs will be designed for diverse cultural and ethnic groups.Language preference and translation issues go hand in hand: interventions cannot be delivered in the caregivers' language of choice unless suitable translations of the material are available, along with bilingual (and preferably bicultural) staff to offer the programs. Because two of the six sites worked with Spanish-speaking caregivers (in Miami, Cuban Americans were the majority of Hispanics seen; in Palo Alto, Mexican Americans were the majority), efforts were made to coordinate translation processes across these sites.The multiple translation processes were lengthy, complex, expensive, and often frustrating for the investigators for a variety of reasons. First, accepted practices of forward and back translation needed to be implemented to arrive at a consensus regarding the meaning and intent of the treatment protocols. A professional translation company had to be used first for the forward translations, to get them into "generic Spanish" that would provide a culturally appropriate starting point. Then panels of bilingual and bicultural Hispanics representing different Hispanic subgroups were convened to do the back translations. Discrepancies in meaning had to be discussed until consensus was achieved. Some use of idioms (which vary regionally in their meaning) was permitted to facilitate accurate comprehension, but this was kept to a minimum.Overall, the process took about a year to accomplish. Second, once these translations had been accomplished effectively, interventionists who were bilingual (and in most instances, bicultural) had to be selected and trained to use the manuals and the treatment delivery assessment forms. These were relatively unfamiliar concepts for most of the staff at these two sites: Even those with a significant background in the social sciences were unaccustomed to following very detailed protocols when interacting with people in distress. Third, many culturally sensitive issues arose over the course of time that needed to be addressed by the interventionists. For example, depression was very common among the caregivers enrolled at both Spanish-speaking sites, and at times it was present to a clinically significant degree. However, management of significant clinical depression was beyond the scope of the REACH protocols. Therefore, the interventionists had to be trained to locate appropriate referral sources, make the actual referral, and follow up to encourage the caregiver to accept the referral.In summary, providing standardized, manual-guided interventions in languages other than English poses challenges in treatment delivery, specifically in adequacy of translation, effective training and supervision of staff, and handling of off-protocol topics and situations. Despite the challenges involved, however, this type of work will be more and more common in the future, particularly in areas of the United States that have high immigrant populations who often do not speak English well enough to communicate their distress and benefit from help that is not delivered in their native language. Strategies to Induce and Assess Treatment Receipt Even if treatment is delivered by the interventionist in exemplary fashion, the investigator should not assume that the caregiver has received the intervention as intended. Numerous threats to treatment receipt are present in caregiver intervention research. For example, burdened caregivers might be distracted and inattentive during training sessions due to events in their environment. Also, older adult caregivers might have diminished hearing, vision, or memory abilities that can hamper their learning. The REACH cooperative group induced and assessed treatment receipt through various methods, including maintaining a record of intervention contacts, assessing caregiver knowledge, documenting intervention sessions, and eliciting caregiver feedback. Each is discussed in more detail below. Record of Contacts and System Utilization. A minimal requirement for any intervention is an accurate record of the frequency, duration, and types of contact between interventionist and client. This information is essential for assessing both treatment delivery and receipt. At all REACH sites, a standard form was used to systematically document information related to contact with caregivers. This information included the number of contacts, duration, and method (e.g., telephone, face-to-face, group, access to computerized information system). The form was completed by the staff member involved in the contact; this individual also documented whether the contact was scheduled or unscheduled, who initiated the contact, who was involved in the contact (e.g., other family members, other professionals, the care recipient), and if the contact was "off protocol." This information was immediately entered into the REACH core database by data entry staff. A record of contacts allowed investigators to analyze outcomes based on type, number, and duration of contacts. It also allowed the supervisor to provide feedback to the interventionists about the degree to which the intervention was delivered to and received by the client.It is important to note here the potential for overlap and the interface between treatment delivery and receipt. For example, interventionists in sites using the MSC were asked to engage the caregivers in phone conversations lasting 15 min. If the contact of record form showed that conversations were consistently much briefer in duration, the supervisor asked the interventionist to redouble his or her efforts to lengthen the conversations (delivery); however, the caregiver's willingness to engage in conversation also influenced the duration of contact (receipt). This example also shows how a TI strategy can serve both induction and assessment functions. The recording process provided data on treatment delivery and receipt; however, supervisory feedback based on the data induced the interventionist to adhere more closely to the protocol. Assessing Caregiver Knowledge of Key Treatment Concepts and Skills. It is important to assess changes in the caregiver's knowledge of the key concepts and skills involved in the targeted intervention. Some of the sites that included didactic caregiver instruction in group or face-to-face format used a formal pre–post knowledge test. Most of the sites achieved this goal by audiotaping intervention contacts. Audiotaped intervention contacts were scored for caregiver understanding of fundamental knowledge of therapeutic behavior using a standard form. Interventionist Documentation. A rich source of information about treatment receipt in REACH was the interventionists' field notes and documentation. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used by the REACH sites and included written summaries of dementia management strategies developed during therapy sessions and documentation of behavioral or environmental problems addressed during treatment. Supervisory feedback from both the knowledge assessment and interventionist documentation was used to induce as well as assess treatment receipt. Feedback From the Caregiver. To collect information about caregiver perspectives on the intervention, all REACH sites used a standard 17-item survey. The questions asked the caregivers to rate their experiences in several topical areas, including education about dementia, caregiver skill building, and perceived benefit of the intervention. In addition, each site included up to 10 site-specific questions to gain information about topics that were unique to their intervention. For instance, 2 of the sites used new technology to deliver the treatment; these sites asked caregivers to rate their experiences of learning to use the system and frequency of problems with the system. The survey was administered to caregivers after the primary endpoint, the 12-month assessment. Thus, the information was used to assess but not induce treatment receipt. Use of this standard form directly accessed information about the caregivers' level of treatment receipt and provided a mechanism for comparing receipt across sites. Strategies to Induce and Assess Treatment Enactment Strategies for inducing and assessing treatment enactment are designed to assess the level at which caregivers actually use the knowledge and skills acquired in treatment and apply these skills to situations outside of the therapy session. Enactment suggests that mechanisms of change are in operation. It is preferable to assess enactment by collecting data from various perspectives. Specifically, combining direct observations with reports from both the caregivers and the interventionists is most advantageous. In the REACH initiative, these strategies were used to both assess and induce treatment enactment. Direct Observation of the Caregiver. Observation of caregivers is the most direct and reliable means of determining the level of treatment enactment. However, for some interventions, such as home-based treatments, this method might also be costly for the researchers and burdensome for the caregiver. At the Alabama site, one of the goals of intervention was to improve caregiver communication skills. Subsequently, all caregiver–care recipient dyads were asked to participate in structured, staged social activities. Each dyadic interaction was videotaped for a total of 90 min, 30 min during baseline followed by four 15-min observations completed over the first 10 weeks of the intervention. Specific feedback was provided to the caregivers at the end of each session regarding communication skills used during the session. Project staff then completed a detailed assessment of these videotaped social interactions. Observing the caregiver's behaviors during these staged social activities provided an opportunity to examine the effects of communication skill training on the caregiver's verbal and nonverbal social behaviors.Group and office-based interventions provide greater opportunities for observation of caregivers, and several REACH sites used this method. Intervention enactment during the sessions was documented on a checklist or rating scale by research staff. At the Philadelphia site, which focused on environmental redesign, caregivers consulted with the interventionist to decide which adaptive equipment addressed their management issues. The purchase of the adaptive equipment was then recorded on a log sheet. Information from these methods for assessing enactment was augmented by interventionist and caregiver reports, as described below. Caregiver Self-Report. Investigators can use caregiver self-reports to collect data regarding which aspects of the intervention are enacted and the frequency with which they are used. Self-reports can also provide valuable information regarding the barriers to enactment and the length of time that strategies are effective (this is particularly important in the case of a progressive condition such as dementia). Consequently, the REACH investigators used several types of self-reports. These included caregivers' reports concerning frequency of strategy use, ability to generalize skills and knowledge to newly emerging situations, and number of weeks that a strategy is in use. The use of self-report forms allows an opportunity for caregivers to reflect on the benefits or consequences of the intervention, to make suggestions for changes that are allowed within the protocol (i.e., individualizing the intervention), and to comment on the usefulness of specific components of the treatment. Interventionist Documentation. Assessing the interventionists' perspectives on enactment may be as simple as obtaining information similar to clients' self-reported use of interventions or as complex as a thematic analysis of field notes. REACH sites used various strategies, including the interventionists' record of caregiver adherence, rating of intervention effectiveness, and progress notes documenting use of treatment strategies. Interventionists at several sites also documented the degree to which caregivers used knowledge and skills to address newly emerging caregiving issues. Summary and Conclusions Dementia caregiving research has progressed from investigations of factors contributing to the stress of caregiving to the development of interventions to alleviate these stressors. Generally, reviews of the efficacy of these interventions have been equivocal, although comprehensive, intensive, and individually tailored interventions appear to be more efficacious than those lacking these characteristics. One problem with existing intervention studies is that the issue of treatment implementation has largely been ignored, making it difficult to interpret findings and draw conclusions regarding treatment efficacy.This article discussed some of the efforts undertaken in the NIH-funded REACH initiative to induce and assess TI. The approaches taken by the research sites vary with the intervention protocols and include using treatment manuals, training and certification of interventionists, and continuous monitoring of actual implementation by audiotaping therapist interactions with caregivers. A unique feature of REACH is that the approaches are based on Lichstein's TI model, which captures three fundamental aspects of TI: delivery, receipt, and enactment (Lichstein et al. 1994   ). Few caregiver intervention studies have reported systematic methods for evaluating treatment along its entire path from presentation to the caregiver to the caregiver's use of the treatment in the natural environment.Various strategies for inducing and assessing treatment delivery, receipt, and enactment have been discussed and are available for use by researchers investigating psychosocial interventions. The examples used from the REACH initiative highlight the necessity of adapting TI strategies to specific interventions and make apparent the potential complexities involved in their application. The amount of complexity is dependent, in part, on the type of intervention used. For example, tracking implementation of computer- or telephone-assisted information and support can be done easily by programming these devices to record usage. Conversely, obtaining quantitative data on caregiver skill usage in the home can be quite challenging, forcing the researcher to infer usage from multiple "softer" measures such as caregiver self-report and interventionists' impressions.As shown in  Table 1  , strategies can be used solely to induce or teach the systematic implementation of an intervention (e.g., treatment manuals) or they can be used solely to assess accurate implementation (e.g., interventionist certification), but most can serve a dual function of inducing and assessing TI. For example, audiotapes from a treatment session will provide information on the therapist's use of intended treatment components (assessment); however, the extent to which this information is used to induce the therapist to deliver the intervention more in line with the intended treatment depends on the study's basic aims. The REACH projects are efficacy trials wherein a specific aim is to clarify whether novel interventions are feasible and whether specific therapeutic activities are related to beneficial changes in caregiver outcomes. Thus, there is an emphasis within the initiative on both assessing TI and frequently using that information to induce the intended treatment.All intervention studies fall somewhere along the efficacy–effectiveness continuum. Effectiveness trials are designed to evaluate the use of interventions in the "real world" after efficacy has been established. An extreme example of an effectiveness trial would involve the evaluation of a manual-guided psychosocial treatment intended for use by therapists in existing community mental health clinics. In such a trial, ongoing induction techniques would be present, but deemphasized. In essence, TI becomes a major outcome variable in effectiveness trials.There are three issues pertaining to the generalizability of interventions incorporating TI strategies that require discussion. First, the process of inducing and assessing TI can and often does produce reactivity in the individual receiving the intervention. Thus, induction and assessment techniques become a part of the intervention itself. It is incumbent on intervention researchers to acknowledge this point when describing their methods and procedures. Second, although the use of induction and assessment techniques is essential, the specific techniques selected can have profound implications for the feasibility of implementing the intervention in the real world. For example, videotaping client behavior in the home, although an excellent enactment assessment strategy, may be too intrusive for some types of interventions and may even undermine intervention goals. In general, it is preferable in naturalistic settings to use strategies that are unobtrusive and maximally feasible. Finally, although we have stated that TI strategies are often deemphasized in effectiveness trials, if induction and assessment techniques are neglected this can have serious implications for the effectiveness of the trial and/or the researcher's ability to draw any conclusions from the study outcome.The availability of TI data will ultimately allow us to have greater insight into findings regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of caregiver interventions. TI data from the REACH initiative will provide information regarding needed modifications in future treatment protocols. If we find, for example, that caregivers have difficulty comprehending a particular aspect of a treatment protocol it would suggest that this component of the protocol requires modification. TI data should also yield valuable information regarding future requirements for interventionist training. Finally, we are planning to assess the impact of variations in TI on targeted outcome measures. If there are differences between actual and intended dosage in the various treatments, we can evaluate the impact of these differences on relevant outcomes (see Henggeler, Melton, Brondino, Scherer, and Hanley 1997   , and Huey, Henggeler, Brondino, and Pickrel 2000   , for examples of clinical studies that include TI data in their analyses).The importance of assessing TI in clinical studies cannot be overstated. Policymakers, researchers, and study participants pay high costs in time and money to develop and test interventions. Without an accurate assessment of whether the intervention was delivered as intended, received by the client, and enacted by the client, conclusions regarding treatment outcomes are suspect. The intervention that was described may not be the intervention that made the difference in caregivers' lives, or interventions that hold great promise for alleviating caregivers' burdens may be discarded altogether.The Forum REACH Research Group—Participating Institutions and Principal Staff University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, AL): Louis Burgio, PhD (Principal Investigator—Tuscaloosa), Alan Stevens, PhD (Principal Investigator—Birmingham), Alfred Bartolucci, PhD, Delois Guy, PhD, William Haley, PhD, David Roth, PhD, David Vance, PhDHebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged Research and Training Institute (Boston, MA): Diane Mahoney, PhD (Principal Investigator), Robert Friedman, MD, Brooke Harrow, PhD, Timothy Heeren, PhD (former participant), Ting Lin, PhD, Barbara Tarlow, PhD, Sharon Tennstedt, PhD, Ladislav Volicer, MD, PhDUniversity of Tennessee, Memphis (Memphis, TN): Robert Burns, MD (Principal Investigator), Marshall Graney, PhD, Kenneth Lichstein, PhD, Jennifer Martindale-Adams, EdD, Linda Nichols, PhD, Grant Somes, PhDUniversity of Miami (Miami, FL): Carl Eisdorfer, MD, PhD (Principal Investigator), Soledad Arguelles, PhD, Trinidad Arguelles, MS, Sara Czaja, PhD, David Loewenstein, PhD, Mark Rubert, PhD, Jose Szapocznik, PhDVeterans Affairs Medical Center (Palo Alto, CA): Dolores Gallagher-Thompson, PhD (Principal Investigator), David Coon, PhD, Helena Kraemer, PhD, Ana Menendez, MS, Larry Thompson, PhDThomas Jefferson University (Philadelphia, PA): Laura N.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined gender differences in cardiovascular responses to laboratory-based stress, as well as in ambulatory hemodynamic (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate) functioning among caregivers of persons with dementia. Design & Methods:Participants were 25 men and 25 women caregivers, matched on age, type of care recipient's dementia, and relationship to the care recipient. After cardiovascular reactivity to a laboratory-based caregiving stressor was assessed, the ambulatory hemodynamic functioning levels of caregivers were measured in caregivers' natural environments. Results:Female caregivers displayed greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to a laboratory-based stress task (i.e., discussing caregiving difficulties) compared with male caregivers (p ≤ .01). In contrast, no gender differences were found for ambulatory hemodynamic functioning when aggregated overall or when in the presence of the care recipient. Implications: Laboratory-based findings suggest that female caregivers experience greater blood pressure reactivity to caregiving-related stress than do male caregivers. However, these laboratory-based gender differences may not generalize to differences in hemodynamic functioning in caregivers' daily lives.   Stress ,  Blood pressure ,  Heart rate Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDCardiovascular reactivity (CVR; sympathetic nervous system activation) reverts to increases in blood pressure and/or heart rate levels in response to an acute stressor and has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (Gerin et al. 2000   ; Krantz and Manuck 1984   ; Manuck 1994   ; Matthews et al. 1986   ). Informal family caregivers of ill or disabled older adults represent a group who generally report high levels of stress and burden (Schulz, Visintainer, and Williamson 1990   ; Zarit 1989   ), the effects of which have been linked to higher ambulatory blood pressure levels (King, Oka, and Young 1994   ) and greater mortality (Schulz and Beach 1999   ) compared to noncaregivers. The caregiving literature further suggests that female caregivers report greater stress and burden than male caregivers (Dura, Haywood-Niler, & Keicolt-Glaser, 1990; Fitting, Rabins, Lucas, & Eastham, 1986; Lutzky & Knight, 1994; Miller & Cafasso, 1992; National Alliance for Caregiving and The American Association of Retired Persons [AARP] 1997   [Yee & Schulz, 2000), but only a few studies have examined gender differences in laboratory-based CVR to stress among caregivers. Results of these studies have been mixed. In one study that included caregivers, women displayed greater blood pressure reactivity to a laboratory-based emotional stress task compared with men (Vitaliano, Russo, Bailey, Young, and McCann 1993   ). Vitaliano and colleagues suggested that the observed gender difference may be the result of the emotional stress task (i.e., discussing familial relationships) being more salient for women than men. Yet, other research on caregivers of persons with dementia has failed to detect gender differences in CVR in response to a laboratory-based emotional stress task in which caregiving problems were discussed (Lutzky and Knight 1994   ).In contrast to the caregiving literature, several studies have suggested that men experience greater blood pressure reactivity to laboratory-based stressors compared with women (Allen, Stoney, Owens, and Matthews 1993   ; Delahanty et al. 2000   ; Matthews, Davis, Stoney, Owens, and Caggiula 1991   ; Polefrone and Manuck 1987   ; Stoney, Davis, and Matthews 1987   ). However, this prior research examining gender differences in CVR in the general population typically focused on young adults; it often did not indicate whether the individuals studied were, like caregivers, experiencing significant daily stressors that could exacerbate physiological responses to stress in the laboratory. The equivocal findings of prior caregiving studies on gender differences in CVR and the unique stress often experienced by older caregivers highlight the need for additional research examining gender differences in CVR among caregivers.Central to the reactivity hypothesis is the assumption that cardiovascular responses detected in the laboratory generalize to cardiovascular functioning in the natural environment (Manuck and Krantz 1986   ; Pickering and Gerin 1990   ). According to the "prevailing state model," CVR states in the laboratory are posited to resemble typical cardiovascular functioning as experienced in everyday life (Manuck and Krantz 1986   ). Based on this model, it would be predicted that if gender differences in laboratory-based CVR are present, then these gender differences should also be seen in the hemodynamic levels of caregivers in the natural setting. However, others have argued that laboratory-based CVR corresponds to the hemodynamic functioning in the natural environment only during times of stress (Matthews, Owens, Allen, and Stoney 1992   ). According to this perspective, it would be predicted that if gender differences in CVR among caregivers are displayed in the laboratory, then gender differences in ambulatory hemodynamic functioning in caregivers should be seen during distressing time periods in the natural setting. In our review of the caregiving literature, we could find no studies assessing gender differences in ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate functioning among family caregivers as experienced in their natural environments. The present study, therefore, provides new information related to whether gender differences exist in ambulatory hemodynamic functioning in caregivers' natural environments.The purpose of this study was twofold. Because of the relatively small number of caregiving studies previously conducted and equivocal findings, the first aim was to extend prior research by examining gender differences in cardiovascular responses to a laboratory-based emotional stressor among caregivers of persons with dementia, a group particularly vulnerable to the effects of stress and burden (Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, and Skaff 1990   ; Schulz and Williamson 1991   ). The second aim was to investigate gender differences in ambulatory hemodynamic (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate) functioning in the caregivers' natural environments. As research has found CVR to be relatively stable over time (Kamarck 1992   ; Veit, Brody, and Rau 1997   ), the present study conceptualized CVR as an individual difference variable.It was first hypothesized that female caregivers would display greater CVR (i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) to a laboratory-based emotional stressor compared to male caregivers. This prediction was based on prior research indicating that women generally report greater stress as a result of caregiving than men. Based on the prevailing state model, it was further hypothesized that women would display greater overall ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) levels compared to men. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that gender differences in ambulatory BP and HR functioning would be present only during times of distress. Specifically, the present study examined ambulatory hemodynamic functioning among both male and female caregivers when they were in the presence of their care recipients, a time period previously associated with distress and increased BP among at least some groups of caregivers (King et al. 1994   ). Methods Participants Male caregivers were recruited from several counties in Northern California to participate in a cross-sectional study designed to investigate the physiological (e.g., BP) and psychological (e.g., stress) health of men who provide informal care to dementia patients. Male caregivers were recruited from March 1997 through April 1999. Data for the matched sample (i.e., female caregivers of dementia patients) were selected from baseline assessments (recruited from February 1996 to April 1998) of the 100 women participating in the Teaching Healthy Lifestyles for Caregivers (TLC) study, a randomized controlled trial conducted in Northern California that examined the effectiveness of health promotion interventions for female caregivers (for a detailed description see Wilcox and King 1999   ). Both male and female caregivers were recruited using a variety of strategies, including newspaper and radio advertisements, posters placed on public transportation, notices sent to Alzheimer's and other caregiver organizations, and newspaper articles describing the research project. Eligibility criteria were similar for both men and women, requiring participants to (a) provide care to a family member or friend diagnosed with some form of dementia (as documented by the care recipient's physician) in the caregiver's home; (b) be 50 years of age or older; (c) not participate in a regular program of physical activity (defined as 3 or more times per week of exercise lasting 20 minutes or more per session over the past 6 months); (d) be free of cardiovascular disease or physical limitations that would hinder participation in light to moderate intensity exercise; (e) be stable on all medications for at least 3 months prior to study entry; and (f) agree to visit the clinical outpatient clinic at Stanford University for a health assessment.Eighty male caregivers were screened for eligibility, and 69% (n = 55) were found ineligible for participation or did not wish to participate. The primary reasons for ineligibility/nonparticipation among the male caregivers were: not interested (20%), not providing more than 10 hours of informal assistance (19%), being too active (17%), and not providing care to someone with dementia (15%). Similarly, the primary reasons for ineligibility/nonparticipation among the female caregivers were: not interested (25%), being too active (12%), not providing care to someone with dementia (18%), and not being in the target age range (5%). As some have argued that the effects of gender in caregiving studies may be confounded by the type of relationship to the care recipient (Lutzky and Knight 1994   ), each of the eligible men (n = 25) was matched to a woman (n = 25) on type of relationship to the care recipient (e.g., spouse, adult child/parent). Other research has suggested that caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients can experience greater caregiving stress and burden compared to caregivers of vascular dementia patients (Vetter et al. 1999   ). Thus, male and female caregivers were also matched on whether they were caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease versus other types of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia). Finally, male and female caregivers were matched on age, based on research suggesting that age is linked to cardiovascular reactivity (Uchino, Uno, Holt-Lunstad, and Flinders 1999   ). Thus, the present study compared 25 male caregivers with 25 female caregivers. Procedure Baseline study protocols for the male and female caregivers were identical, with the same research technicians performing the assessments for both. Participants were scheduled for morning clinic health assessments, which included measurement of height and weight, participation in a CVR task, a physical activity interview, and completion of questionnaires. After leaving the clinic (typically around 1:00 p.m.), participants wore the ambulatory BP/HR monitor throughout the day until they retired for the evening. Measures Demographics and Health Participants completed a measure of demographic characteristics, including their age (in years), education (in years), annual household income, and ethnicity. They also completed a health history, including current medications. Caregiving Characteristics Participants completed a survey focused on various aspects of their caregiving experiences (King and Brassington 1997   ). Items used in this investigation included their familial relationship to the care recipient, diagnosis of care recipient (confirmed by the care recipient's physician), age of care recipient, years or months spent caregiving, hours per week spent caregiving, and type of assistance provided to care recipient. Psychological Caregiver burden was measured with the 25-item Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB; Vitaliano, Russo, Young, Becker, and Maiuro 1991   ). It assesses the prevalence of experiences that are common among caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and the distress associated with each of the experiences (on a scale ranging from 1 = "no distress" to 4 = "severe distress"), thus yielding an objective and subjective burden score. Possible scores on the subjective burden scale range from 25 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater distress related to the caregiving experiences. This measure has adequate internal consistency, reliability, and validity (Vitaliano, Russo, Young, et al. 1991   ; Vitaliano, Young, and Russo 1991   ). Depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, and Erbaugh 1961   ), a 21-item self-report questionnaire. For each item, participants choose one of four statements, graded in terms of severity, that describes their thoughts over the past week. The BDI has been used extensively in clinical as well as community samples and has adequate internal consistency, reliability, and validity (see review by Beck, Steer, and Garbin 1988   ). Its psychometric properties are acceptable in noncognitively impaired older populations (Scogin 1994   ). CVR CVR to a laboratory-based psychological stressor was measured using an interpersonal interview with a trained research technician, a strategy previously used by prior researchers examining CVR among older adult caregivers (Lutzky and Knight 1994   ; Vitaliano et al. 1993   ). During the CVR interview, BP (mm Hg) and HR (beats/minute) levels were assessed in 2-min intervals using a Colin ambulatory BP/HR monitor (Model ABPM-630; Colin Medical Instruments, Plainfield, NJ) attached to the nondominant arm. The Colin monitor records BP using both oscillometric and auscultatory (Korotkoff sound) methods (White, Lund-Johansen, and McCabe 1989   ). As more complete data were obtained through the oscillometric method, and the two methods provided reasonably close reading in the study samples, only readings from the oscillometric method are reported (King et al. 1994   ).The CVR protocol proceeded as follows: First, participants were asked to sit alone quietly in a room and listen to relaxing music via headphones for a 10-minute rest period. Following the rest period, the research technician engaged the participant in conversation on a neutral topic for 2 minutes to obtain a recording while the caregiver was talking. Next, participants were asked to speak for about 6 minutes (i.e., task period) on the following topic: "Tell me what frustrates or disturbs you the most or what angers or upsets you about being a caregiver." The technician gave minimal verbal responses during the task period. An additional 10 minutes (i.e., recovery period) followed the speech task, in which the research technician left the room and the participants sat quietly. After the CVR protocol, participants were asked if they had additional comments or questions concerning the task. As prior research has suggested that aggregating multiple cardiovascular recordings within a particular time period increases measurement reliability (Kamarck 1992   ), BP and HR recordings in the present study were averaged within each time portion of the emotional challenge (i.e., rest, task, recovery) to obtain mean systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR levels. Ambulatory BP and HR Monitoring Details of procedures for collection of ambulatory monitoring data, described previously (King et al. 1994   ), will be briefly described here. The ambulatory recording portion of the protocol began typically around 1:00 p.m., following the participants' study assessment visit. The ambulatory BP/HR monitor was programmed to automatically record at one-hour intervals up until the time that the participant retired for the night. The decision to use hourly rather than more frequent recordings was based on information obtained during a prior study with female caregivers (King et al. 1994   ), in which caregivers indicated that more frequent recordings would create undue burden. To minimize movement artifact that could interfere with BP and HR recordings, participants were instructed to remain in the position (e.g., sitting, standing) they occupied during the initiation of the cuff inflation through end of the inflation, and to minimize movement of the cuffed arm (White et al. 1989   ). The recorder was placed in a waist-worn belt, with leads to the cuff worn under clothing to minimize disruption or inconvenience.Participants concurrently recorded psychosocial and health-related information on an hourly basis using a lightweight (440g) pocket computer diary (Casio PB-1000, Casio Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) until they retired for the night (detailed description of the Casio PB-1000 provided by King et al. 1994   ). The pocket computer was programmed to automatically inform the participant each hour, via a series of auditory beeps, that it was time to complete the diary. At each hour, participants answered a series of questions by touching the computer screen at designated times; the diary took approximately 3 minutes to complete. Information gathered via the computer included who was present (e.g., care recipient, other family members, coworker), position during each BP/HR recording (e.g., sitting, standing), current mood (anger, upset, tension/anxiety, and sadness; 1 = "none" to 10 = "extreme"), level of control over the situation (1 = "low" to 10 = "high"), level of demand of the situation (1 = "low" to 10 = "high"), and physical activity level. The PB-1000 has been found to be an accurate and reliable method of obtaining momentary health-related information in the natural environment in both caregiving (King et al. 1994   ) and noncaregiving (Taylor, Fried, and Kenardy 1990   ) samples. Analysis Plan CVR in Laboratory Descriptive analyses were first conducted to examine male and female caregivers on a number of demographic and caregiving-related variables. To test the first hypothesis (laboratory-based CVR gender differences), the female caregivers' SBP, DBP, and HR scores were subtracted from the respective SBP, DBP, and HR scores of the matched male caregivers, thus removing any influence of the matching factors. All participants had BP and HR scores for each time period (i.e., rest, task, and recovery). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was first conducted for the three outcome measures to test the overall main effect of Gender × Time. Given that individuals can demonstrate different levels of response across different hemodynamic variables (Matthews et al. 1986   ), the MANOVA test for overall Gender × Time effect was expected to be significant. Two-way ANOVA procedures (Pair × Time) were then conducted for each outcome (i.e., SBP, DBP, & HR). In each analysis, the main effect of Gender (i.e., grand mean) and Gender × Time were tested. When there was a significant Gender × Time effect, contrast analyses were conducted comparing (a) rest versus task scores to further examine gender difference in reactivity, and (b) task versus recovery scores to examine gender differences in recovery following the task. As some have suggested that the use of antihypertensive (including beta blockers and calcium channel blockers) and anxiolytic medication may confound the relationship between gender and CVR (Vitaliano et al. 1993   ), we also conducted multivariate analyses controlling for the use of these medications. None of the caregivers reported using anxiolytic medication in the absence of antihypertensive medication (one woman caregiver reported using both anxiolytic and antihypertensive medication), and the proportions of men and women using antihypertensive medication were equivalent (see  Table 1  ). As the findings from multivariate analyses (not shown) controlling for these medications were identical to the original analyses (not controlling for medication), only the original analyses are displayed. Ambulatory Hemodynamic Functioning To test the second hypothesis (gender differences in ambulatory hemodynamic functioning), two sets of paired sample t-test analyses (men vs matched women) were conducted. For the first set of analyses, ambulatory SBP, DBP, and HR scores were each averaged across the day for each participant. For each outcome measure (i.e., SBP, DBP, and HR), a t-test analysis compared male caregivers with their matched female caregivers. Ambulatory data were missing for one female caregiver, and her respective matched male caregiver was subsequently deleted from analyses. Thus, the sample sizes for the first set of analyses examining ambulatory functioning were 24 male caregivers and 24 female caregivers.For the second set of analyses, ambulatory SBP, DBP, and HR scores were each averaged only if the caregiver indicated (using the pocket computer) that the care recipient was present during the time the blood pressure was being measured. For each outcome (SBP, DBP, and HR in the presence of the care recipient), a t-test analysis compared male caregivers with their matched female caregivers. Two men and five women had missing pocket computer and/or hemodynamic functioning data, and their respective matched pairs were subsequently deleted from analyses. Thus, the sample sizes for the second set of analyses examining ambulatory functioning were 19 male caregivers and 19 female caregivers. Results In descriptive analyses ( Table 1  ), men and women were comparable in age, years of education, race/ethnicity proportions, household income, hypertension medication use, years of providing care, caregiving burden (SCB; Vitaliano, Russo, Young, et al. 1991   ), and level of depression (BDI; Beck et al. 1961   ). The ages of the care recipients and the types of caregiving tasks performed were also comparable. Despite matching on type of relationship with the care recipient, type of dementia, and age, women spent somewhat more hours providing care per week than men (89.5 vs 61.5 h/week, respectively; p ≤ .05). However, correlational analyses (not shown) indicated that gender differences in hours per week providing care were unrelated to the outcome measures (SBP, DBP, and HR reactivity; p values > .05).Among the female caregivers, descriptive analyses showed that those who were included were similar to those who were excluded in years of education (p = .88), years of providing care (p = .60), type of dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, p = .33), level of caregiving burden (subjective: p = .25; objective: p = .37), level of depression (p = .16), level of SBP reactivity (task—rest; p = .47), DBP reactivity (task—rest; p = .33), and HR reactivity (task—rest; p = .08). Women included in the present study were more likely to be spouses of dementia patients (p < .001) and were older (p < .001) compared with women not included. Cardiovascular Reactivity in Laboratory Results of the MANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Gender × Time, Pillai's Trace, F(6,94) = 2.26, p ≤ .05. Results of two-way ANOVA procedures testing the first hypothesis for each outcome measure (SBP, DBP, and HR) are presented in  Table 2  .With respect to SBP reactivity, results indicated that Gender × Time was significantly related to SBP levels in the laboratory. Contrast analyses revealed that rest SBP levels for men versus women were significantly different from task SBP levels for men versus women. Furthermore, task SBP levels for men versus women were significantly different from recovery SBP levels for men versus women. The SBP reactivity gender differences are displayed in  Fig. 1 . Women experienced greater SBP reactivity (i.e., increase from rest to task periods) compared with men. Although the SBP of men increased significantly from 135.2 mm Hg at rest to 147.3 mm Hg during the task, the increase was not as large as the change in womens' SBP levels (133.3 mm Hg to 152.6 mm Hg). Women also displayed greater SBP recovery following that task period than did men (p ≤ .01); recovery period SBP levels for both men and women were comparable to SBP levels during the rest period.Turning to DBP reactivity, results indicated that Gender and Gender × Time were significantly related to DBP levels in the laboratory (see  Table 2  ). Similar to SBP reactivity, contrast analyses revealed that rest DBP levels for men versus women were significantly different from task DBP levels for men versus women. In addition, task DBP levels for men versus women were significantly different from recovery DBP levels for men versus women. The DBP reactivity gender differences are displayed in  Fig. 2 . Women displayed greater DBP reactivity (i.e., increase from rest to task periods) compared with men. Women also displayed greater DBP recovery following the stress task compared with men (p ≤ .01); recovery period DBP levels were comparable to DBP levels during the rest period.Concerning HR reactivity, Gender × Time was not significantly related to HR levels (see  Table 2  ). The similar HR reactivity and recovery levels between men and women caregivers are displayed in  Fig. 3 . While HR levels of both men and women increased from rest to task periods, there was no significant difference between men and women in the magnitude (i.e., slope) of the increases from rest to task periods, nor in the magnitude of the decreases from task to recovery periods. Ambulatory Blood Pressure/Heart Rate Ambulatory BP and HR levels were assessed an average of 7.8 times during the day among the male caregivers. For female caregivers, ambulatory BP and HR levels were assessed an average of 8.1 times during the day, gender difference not significant, t(1,47) = –0.61, p = .55. Fig. 4  illustrate average daily (i.e., overall) ambulatory hemodynamic functioning in male and female caregivers (group means, representing the day, were obtained for each participant and then scores were averaged for each gender). In t-test analyses, no significant gender differences were detected for overall ambulatory SBP, t(1,23) = 0.46, p = .65; DBP, t(1,23) = 1.31, p = .20; or HR, t(1,23) = –0.42, p = .68. Taken together, findings indicated that overall ambulatory SBP, DBP and HR functioning were similar for male and female caregivers. Fig. 5  illustrate ambulatory hemodynamic functioning in male and female caregivers when they were in the presence of their care recipients (group means, representing the day, were obtained for each participant when care recipient was present; then scores were averaged for each gender). In t-test analyses, no significant gender differences were detected for ambulatory SBP, t(1,18) = 0.18, p = .86; DBP, t(1,18) = 1.54, p = .14; or HR, t(1,18) = –0.52, p = .61, levels in the presence of the care recipients. Thus, findings indicated that ambulatory BP and HR levels were comparable for male and female caregivers when they were in the presence of their care recipients.A possible explanation for the failure to detect gender differences in hemodynamic functioning in the presence of care recipients is that levels of caregiver distress and burden among these older caregivers were no different when in the presence versus absence of the care recipients. To explore this possibility, averaged mood (i.e., anger, upset, tension/anxiety, and sadness), control, and demand levels when the care recipient was present were compared to averaged mood, control, and demand levels when the care recipient was absent. A total of 34 male and female caregivers had pocket computer data both when care recipients were present and absent during the time of recording. These analyses revealed that caregivers reported higher levels of anger (p ≤ .05), upset (p ≤ .05), and tension/anxiety (p ≤ .05) when their care recipient was present compared with when their care recipient was absent. In addition, caregivers reported lower levels of control over the current situation (p ≤ .001) and higher levels of demand (p ≤ .05) when their care recipient was present compared with when the care recipient was absent. Taken together, these findings suggest that caregivers experienced greater distress and burden during the time period when the care recipient was present versus absent. Given this, it is possible that comparing male and female caregivers on hemodynamic functioning in the absence versus presence of the care recipient may represent a better reflection of caregivers' CVR in their natural environments than overall ambulatory levels. However, 7 male and 9 female caregivers in the present sample were either always with the care recipient during the monitoring period (n = 10) or did not have pocket computer data indicating whether or not they were with the care recipient (n = 6). Elimination of the matched pairs that corresponded to these 16 caregivers resulted in a significant reduction sample size (by nearly two thirds) and, thus, precluded our ability to assess gender differences in hemodynamic functioning in the absence versus presence of the care recipient. Discussion Informal caregivers of ill or disabled older adults can experience significant stress and burden, both acute and chronic (Zarit 1989   ). Caregivers of persons with dementia are particularly vulnerable to the experience of stress and burden (Pearlin et al. 1990   ; Schulz and Williamson 1991   ). Furthermore, some research has suggested that female caregivers experience greater stress and burden than male caregivers (Dura et al. 1990   ; Fitting et al. 1986   ; Lutzky and Knight 1994   ; Miller and Cafasso 1992   ; National Alliance for Caregiving & AARP, 1997; Yee and Schulz 2000   ). An issue not as well researched concerns gender differences in physiological responses (i.e., CVR) to caregiving stress.Laboratory results from the present investigation indicated that female caregivers experienced greater BP reactivity in response to a stressor compared with male caregivers. Gender differences were found even after controlling for (i.e., matching on) type of relationship to the care recipient, type of dementia, and age. Although the BP levels of male caregivers increased when discussing caregiving difficulties in the laboratory, female caregivers' BP reactivity responses were stronger and more pronounced. Insofar as CVR has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD; Gerin et al. 2000   ; Krantz and Manuck 1984   ; Manuck 1994   ; Matthews et al. 1986   ), the present laboratory findings suggest that female caregivers of dementia patients may be at increased risk of CVD by virtue of their elevated CVR levels.The laboratory-based CVR protocol (i.e., interpersonal interview) in the present study was analogous to strategies used to detect reactivity in prior caregiving research (Lutzky and Knight 1994   ; Vitaliano et al. 1993   ). The present laboratory findings converge with prior caregiving research indicating that women display greater blood pressure reactivity than men (Vitaliano et al. 1993   ), and contrast with other studies that have failed to detect gender differences in CVR among caregivers (Lutzky and Knight 1994   ). Although caregivers in the present study were similar to the 94 caregivers studied by Lutzky and Knight 1994    in age, ethnicity, type of caregiver (i.e., dementia caregiver), and years providing care, the caregivers in the present study had higher income and education levels. Yet, it remains unclear whether these socioeconomic differences in caregiver samples can explain the differential findings. The present results replicate results obtained by Vitaliano and colleagues 1993   , who suggested that salience of the emotional task may explain gender differences in CVR to laboratory-based stress. However, support for this explanation in studies on the general population has been equivocal. Some studies have indicated that gender-relevant stress tasks influence gender differences in CVR (Lash, Eisler, and Southard 1995   ; Lash, Gillespie, Eisler, and Southard 1991   ), whereas others failed to find a relationship between gender relevance and cardiovascular responses to laboratory-based stress (Matthews et al. 1991   ). Other possible explanations for gender differences in CVR among caregivers that future investigations could explore include gender differences in psychological (e.g., dispositional factors), physiological (e.g., circulating catecholamines), social (e.g., social support), and caregiving-specific (e.g., frequency of caregiving stressors experienced) characteristics.The present study also sought to examine whether laboratory-based gender differences in CVR generalized to hemodynamic functioning in the caregivers' daily lives. Findings from the present study were not consistent with the pattern of results as would have been predicted by the prevailing state model, which posits that CVR states in the laboratory should be similar to conditions typically experienced in everyday life. Overall ambulatory BP and HR levels were not significantly different for male and female caregivers as measured in their natural environments. We also failed to detect gender differences in ambulatory hemodynamic functioning among caregivers when they were in the presence of their care recipients. Thus, the difference between men and women in acute physiological stress reactions displayed in the laboratory was not found to generalize to the daily BP and HR levels of caregivers. Further research is needed to examine if gender differences in laboratory-based CVR generalize to specific situations (i.e., acute daily stressors), rather than more general conditions experienced in caregivers' everyday lives. Because of the undue burden of more frequent monitoring (King et al. 1994   ), the present study assessed ambulatory hemodynamic functioning on an hourly basis. Increased frequency of monitoring would, however, enhance power to detect group differences. Future research could also assess gender differences in hemodynamic functioning when the care recipient was absent versus present to better determine if such conditions are more sensitive in evaluating whether laboratory-based CVR findings generalize to the natural environment in this population. A challenge for this assessment strategy is monitoring hemodynamic functioning more frequently and over longer periods of time (i.e., more than one day) to more thoroughly capture hemodynamic functioning in different situations, while also avoiding undue burden.Some limitations of the present investigation must be acknowledged. First, all participants in the present study were caregivers of dementia patients. It is unclear whether the results would generalize to those providing care to older adults with other types of illnesses or disabilities. As most of the caregivers in the present study were spouses, the extent to which gender differences in CVR found in the present study would generalize to nonspousal (e.g., adult children) caregivers remains unclear. The limited number of male nonspousal caregivers in the study precluded an exploration of this issue. In addition, caregivers were primarily White, well educated, and of middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds. It is possible that male and female caregivers who differ from individuals assessed in our sample may show dissimilar patterns of physiological responses to stress as a result of different cultural and/or life experiences. Secondly, because a cross-sectional design was utilized, we can not ascertain whether gender differences in CVR emerged following the stress of caregiving or were present prior to the beginning of caregiving. Longitudinal and prospective caregiving research would help to shed light on when gender differences in CVR emerge or become pronounced during the course of caregiving.The exploration of gender differences in psychophysiological responses to stress among caregivers warrants further investigation, particularly given the high level of stress often reported by caregivers (Zarit 1989   ) and the detrimental health consequences linked to caregiving stress (King et al. 1994   ; Schulz and Beach 1999   ; Schulz et al. 1990   ). This study contributes to the caregiving literature by providing further evidence that female caregivers experience greater cardiovascular reactivity to a caregiving-specific stressor compared to male caregivers. Additional research is required to clarify and refine when laboratory-based gender differences in CVR among caregivers may generalize to hemodynamic functioning in real life.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: There is no clear consensus about how sex influences prevalent disability and through what mechanisms. We investigated whether sex had a direct inde-pendent effect on disability or whether sex had an interactive effect on the relationship between chronic diseases/conditions and disability, and whether these effects differed in middle-aged versus older adults. Design and Methods:We used baseline data from two nationally representative health interview surveys, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), and disability and covariate measures that were nearly identical in both surveys. Logistic regression models tested the contributions of diseases, impairments, and demographic and social characteristics on difficulties with prevalent activities of daily living (ADLs), mobility, and strength. Results:Models demonstrated no direct sex effect for ADL disability in either age group after adjusting for key covariates. However, sex did exert an indirect effect on ADL disability in older adults via musculoskeletal conditions and depressive symptoms. In contrast, female sex remained strongly associated with mobility and strength disability in both age groups, net of covariates. Major interactions were also significant, including a female sex/body mass index (BMI) interaction for mobility difficulty and several sex–disease interactions for strength disability in the middle-aged group. Implications: The effect of sex on ADL difficulty is largely explained by social and health-related covariates in middle-aged and older adults. In contrast, the independent association of female sex with decreased strength and mobility in both groups cannot be explained by our models' social or health-related variables. In addition, the positive association of BMI with mobility difficulty is significantly worse for women than for men.   Activities of daily living ,  Mobility ,  Strength ,  Body mass index Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDAlthough the relationship between sex and disability has been studied for more than 20 years, there is no consensus about how sex influences disability and through what mechanisms. It is well known that there is a consistently higher prevalence of self-reported disability in women than in men, yet the independent effect of sex varies with the measures of disability examined and the covariates considered (Fried, Ettinger, Lind, Newman, and Gardin 1994   ; Johnson and Wolinsky 1994   ; Verbrugge 1985   , Verbrugge 1989   ). The higher prevalence of disability reported by women can be explained: Women and men differ in the prevalence or severity of diseases causing disability, in their reporting of disability, and in their rates of mortality (Fried et al. 1994   ; Merrill, Seeman, Kasl, and Berkman 1997   ; Verbrugge 1985   , Verbrugge 1989   ; Wingard 1984   ). However, it is not clear why the independent effect of sex on disability differs across studies. Three reasons are plausible. First, researchers measure disability in different ways, evaluating some or all of the activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), or functional limitation measures, or using separate or composite measures, factors, or scales combining all three types of disability. Second, researchers use different covariates to adjust for confounding effects. Third, disability transitions differ by disease and sex (Crimmins and Saito 1993   ; Peek and Coward 1999   ). Although increased disability incidence in women may help to explain women's higher prevalence of mobility disability (Leveille, Penninx, Melzer, Izmirlian, and Guralnik 2000   ), the reasons for the higher incidence remain speculative.While some researchers concentrate on explaining the association of sex with disability, others assume interaction effects by modeling associations between covariates and disability separately for men and women (Ettinger, Fried, Harris, Shemanski, and Schulz 1994   ; Johnson and Wolinsky 1994   ; Manton 1988   ). Few have systematically tested an interactive model in which sex moderates the link between disease and disability. Such analyses could help determine whether processes leading from diseases to disabilities differ between men and women. Finally, most studies on sex and disability have examined data on older adults alone. Comparisons of older versus younger age groups (Clark, Stump, and Wolinsky 1997   ) may also provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and generalizability of the sex effect on different measures of disability and across age groups.The goal of this study was to answer two questions about the effect of sex on prevalent disability: (1) Can the association of sex with disability be explained by social and health-related covariates; and (2) Does sex have an interactive effect on the relationship between chronic diseases and disability? We hypothesized that the association of increased disability with female sex would not be fully explained by covariates and that the associations between chronic diseases/conditions and disability would not differ by sex. We examined these issues in two age groups using data from two nationally representative surveys: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51–61 and the Study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) of adults aged 70 and older. We developed a conceptual model linking chronic diseases, conditions, and impairments to disability, and examined three composite measures of disability that were identical in both surveys. Methods Conceptual Model and Covariates Our basic model included documented covariates of disability: demographics, chronic diseases and impairments, physiological characteristics, and social risk factors. We estimated models in both older and middle-aged age groups and tested whether sex modified the relationship of chronic diseases and impairments with disability. Further, we analyzed disability measures that were identical or nearly so in the two surveys and grouped them into three domains: measures of ADLs, mobility, and strength. These measures are similar to classic disability and functional limitation measures (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffe 1963   ; Nagi 1979   ; Rosow and Breslau 1966   ) and have been discussed in detail elsewhere. Their factor structure has been reported to be similar in the HRS and AHEAD (Clark et al. 1997   ).Because demographic and social variables are known to covary with disability, we controlled for age, race/ethnicity, educational level, and marital status as well as sex in all models. Similarly, we included measures of chronic diseases and conditions (cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, diabetes, stroke, vision, and hearing) that have different prevalences by sex and are strongly associated with functional difficulty (Boult, Kane, and Louis 1994   ; Fried et al. 1994   ; Manton 1989   ; Rudberg, Furner, and Dunn 1993   ).Declines in cognition are also associated with difficulties in daily functioning (Diehl, Willis, and Schaie 1995   ; Scherr et al. 1988   ; Wray, Herzog, Park, and Alwin 2001   ). Although women generally score higher on cognitive performance tests, net of age and education, few studies have evaluated the effect of sex on disability controlling for cognitive performance. Further, although the causal ordering of the depression/disability relationship is not well established (i.e., whether depression is the cause or consequence of functional difficulties), depressive symptoms have also been found to be significantly associated with disability, particularly in older versus middle-aged adults (Bruce, Seeman, Merrill, and Blazer 1994   ; Mirowsky and Ross 1992   ). Some studies have found that depressive symptoms are even stronger correlates of functional limitations than are the underlying diseases (Hays, Wells, Sherbourne, Rogers, and Spritzer 1995   ). In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms is generally reported to differ among men and women, but few studies have looked at the sex effect on disability while controlling for depressive symptoms. We controlled for both cognitive performance and depressive symptoms in our models.Finally, although physiological tests were not administered in our surveys, we used self-reported height and weight to construct body mass index (BMI, or weight corrected for height), which is known to be significantly and independently associated with disability (Launer, Harris, Rumpel, and Madans 1994   ; Verbrugge, Gates, and Ike 1991   ). Because the relationship is not linear but, rather, associated with high and low BMI (Ferraro and Booth 1999   ; Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley, Bales, and Fillenbaum 1994   ), we evaluated the effect of BMI in the highest tertile. Age Group Differences There are several ways in which age-group comparisons help validate findings about sex and disability in older adults. The association of sex with disability may differ in middle-aged versus older people because middle-aged men and women experience diseases and impairments in different relative prevalences than do older adults (Wingard 1984   ). Other covariates of disability (e.g., cognitive performance, depression, or education) may also differ between middle-aged and older men and women. Finally, selective survival and the sex difference in active life expectancy may confuse interpretation of sex effects on disability, particularly in older adults. Data Data were analyzed from the baseline waves of two population-based surveys: the 1992 HRS and the 1993 AHEAD. The HRS surveyed 12,652 Americans who were aged 51–61 in 1992 (or their spouses), and the AHEAD surveyed 8,222 Americans who were at least aged 70 in 1993 (or their spouses). The current study samples include the 9,824 HRS nonproxy respondents who were aged 51–61 in 1992 and the 6,660 AHEAD nonproxy respondents who were at least aged 70 in 1993. Additional information on the design and administration of the HRS and AHEAD is described in detail elsewhere (Juster and Suzman 1995   ; Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, and Wallace 1997   ). Variable Measurement The dependent variables measured the extent to which HRS or AHEAD respondents reported any difficulties with three categories of activities: Difficulties with ADLs—difficulties with any of four personal care activities (e.g., transferring in/out of bed, dressing, bathing, or eating);Difficulties with mobility activities—difficulties with any of three mobility (or lower body) activities (e.g., walking across a room, walking several blocks, climbing a flight of stairs); andDifficulties with strength activities—difficulties with any of two strength (or primarily upper body) activities (e.g., pushing a piece of furniture, lifting 10 pounds).The study's independent variables included:Demographic risk factors: Age (chronological age, 51–61 in the HRS, 70 and above in the AHEAD, centered on the grand mean in each data set); Female; Black (African American);Life-threatening or disabling chronic conditions: Cardiopulmonary conditions—history of heart problems or lung disease; Musculoskeletal conditions—active arthritis or history of fractures or broken bones; history of Stroke; active Diabetes; Other (history of cancer or high blood pressure) (see  Appendix , Note 1);Physiology: Body Mass Index (BMI in the highest tertile for the HRS or AHEAD respondents);Sensory conditions: Impaired vision (fair/poor/blind); Impaired hearing (fair/poor/deaf);Low cognitive performance—a total score from the immediate and delayed word recall tests within the lowest quartile for scores in the HRS or AHEAD (Herzog and Wallace 1997   ) (see  Appendix , Note 2);High depressive symptoms—a total score from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (Radloff 1977   ) within the highest quartile for the HRS or AHEAD respondents (see  Appendix , Note 3); andSocial risk factors: Education (years of completed education 0–17, centered on 12 years); being Married/partnered. Data Analysis Characteristics of HRS and AHEAD respondents were compared using standard descriptive methods. Logistic regression models tested the relative contributions of diseases, conditions, and impairments as well as demographic and social factors on three measures of functional difficulties. The models estimated the effects of four sequentially entered blocks of variables on functional difficulties in both age groups: (1) sex and other demographic risk factors; (2) sex, demographic factors, diseases, and impairments; (3) the measures in (2) plus the social risk factors; and (4) the measures in (3) plus interaction terms for sex by each of the diseases, conditions, and impairments. We weighted all models for selection probability and evaluated them by standard techniques to assess significance and goodness of fit using SAS for Windows (SAS Institute 1990   ). Results  Table 1  presents percentages and means on demographic and social risk factors as well as diseases, conditions, and impairments for HRS and AHEAD respondents, overall for each age group and by sex within each age group. Values that are significantly different for men and women (at p ≤ .05) are marked with asterisks.  Table 2  Table 3  Table 4  Table 5  Table 6  Table 7  follow with results of the multivariate analyses (presenting odds ratios and p values) on the models for ADL, mobility, and strength difficulties in the HRS and AHEAD age groups. The three factors most strongly associated with the outcomes (based on Wald chi-square statistics) are bolded. As shown in  Table 1  , the mean age in the two age groups differed by 20-plus years, and older AHEAD respondents had higher proportions of women and African Americans. Among HRS respondents, educational levels were similar for men and women, and men were more frequently married. Middle-aged HRS men and women differed on specific health conditions: Women reported more musculoskeletal conditions; men reported stroke, cardiopulmonary disease, and impaired hearing more often than did women. Women tested higher in cognitive performance and reported greater difficulties with ADLs, mobility, and strength, compared to men.Neither marital status nor education differed in AHEAD men and women. However, disproportionately greater numbers of older men reported cardiopulmonary conditions, strokes, and hearing im-pairments; more women reported musculoskeletal problems and other diseases. Although BMI was similar in older men and women, both means were less in the AHEAD than in the HRS. Similar to the middle-aged women, the older women performed somewhat better on the word recall tests. More than half of the older women reported difficulties with function. Although the prevalence of functional limitations was greater in the AHEAD group, the sex differences showed the same patterns as in the HRS. Difficulties With ADLs  Table 2  indicates that being a woman was not significantly associated with difficulties in personal care or ADLs in middle-aged adults. For example, older age and Black race/ethnicity status significantly increased the odds of reporting difficulties in Model 1 but female sex did not. Once diseases, conditions, and impairments as well as demographic factors were controlled in Model 2, age and race/ethnicity lost significance; instead, each disease, condition, and impairment was positively associated with ADL difficulties. Based on Wald chi-square statistics, depressive symptoms, musculoskeletal conditions, and impaired vision (bolded) were particularly important. After social risk factors were added in Model 3, higher levels of education were strongly significant. Finally, no interactions (Model 4) were significant or changed the previous pattern of associations. Table 3  illustrates that being an AHEAD woman was not directly and significantly associated with difficulty with ADLs; however, sex did exert indirect effects. Although all demographic variables were associated with ADL difficulties in Model 1, when diseases and impairments were added in Model 2, only the age effect remained significant and important and the direct sex effect was borderline. In contrast, all diseases, conditions, and impairments other than hearing and miscellaneous conditions were significant, the strongest associations being musculoskeletal conditions and depressive symptoms where sex differences have been demonstrated in previous studies. As shown in Model 3, social variables were not significantly associated with ADL difficulties nor did they add to the model. Notably, education did not change the association of low cognitive performance to ADL difficulties in the older age group (AHEAD).When the interaction terms were added in Model 4, the female by musculoskeletal conditions and female by depressive symptoms terms were significant for ADL difficulties. In addition, the main effect for female (from Model 3) disappeared, but the main effects for musculoskeletal conditions and depressive symptoms remained. One can calculate joint effects to distinguish how musculoskeletal problems influenced ADL disability differently in men and women: Women were about three times as likely to report ADL difficulties if they had musculoskeletal problems, and men with musculoskeletal problems were about twice as likely to report ADL difficulties compared to men without musculoskeletal problems (the referent group). In the absence of musculoskeletal problems, there was no direct sex effect. Age-Group Differences. HRS and AHEAD differences included the effects of older age, highest tertile BMI, lower cognitive performance, and sex/musculoskeletal and sex/depressive symptoms interactions in the older age group as well as significant associations of education and hypertension/cancer in the younger group. Age-group similarities included the disappearance of the sex effect on ADL difficulties when covariates were considered, and the strong associations of depressive symptoms and most major diseases and conditions. Difficulties With Mobility Being a middle-aged woman was significantly associated with difficulties in mobility, even after controlling for covariates ( Table 4  ). In Model 1, being female increased the odds of reporting mobility problems by 63%; and age and race/ethnicity were also positively associated. When diseases, conditions, and impairments were added (Model 2), the effect of age disappeared and the effect of sex increased. All of the health factors—particularly cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and depressive symptoms—were significantly associated with mobility difficulties. When education and marital status were controlled in Model 3, impaired cognition lost significance and the associations of other diseases and conditions were attenuated; however, the effect of being female persisted.In Model 4, the sex/BMI interaction was highly significant, and the independent effect of sex also remained. The joint effect of sex and high BMI nearly tripled the odds of mobility difficulties for women with high BMI, compared with a 53% increase for men with high BMI. Table 5  presents parallel models for mobility difficulties for AHEAD respondents. Sex and age were consistently significant, but race/ethnicity dropped out after health factors were added. All diseases, conditions, and impairments (except hearing) were significant in Model 2. Education became significant when added in Model 3, but impaired cognitive performance lost significance. Musculoskeletal conditions, depressive symptoms, and age were most strongly associated with mobility difficulties. A significant interaction between sex and BMI (Model 4) indicated that women with a high BMI were more than twice as likely as were men without high BMI to report mobility difficulty. Men with high BMI were about equally likely as women without high BMI to report mobility difficulty. Age-Group Differences Differences between the age groups were few: Age was associated with mobility difficulty in the older group and hearing in the younger group. In contrast, the significant direct associations of sex with education, depressive symptoms, most diseases and conditions, and a highly significant interaction between sex with BMI were of similar magnitude in both age groups. Difficulties With Strength As illustrated in  Table 6  , the effect of being female was strong for strength difficulties in middle-aged adults. Net of age and race/ethnicity, women were three times as likely as men to report difficulties with pushing furniture or lifting 10 pounds (Model 1). The effect increased once diseases, conditions, and impairments were added in Model 2, despite the fact that many health factors were also significant and positively associated with strength problems. As shown in Model 3, the effects of sex, diseases, and impairments remained strong even after controlling for education and marital status. Finally, after adding the interaction terms to the model (Model 4), the sex effect was even more pronounced. Similar to the mobility findings, the main effect for being female remained strong (odds ratio [OR] = 4.09), and multiple interactions were also significant (cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes, high BMI, sensory impairments, and impaired mental health). For example, women with cardiopulmonary conditions were about nine times, women without over four times, and men with cardiopulmonary conditions over three times as likely as men without such conditions to report strength difficulties. Table 7  illustrates the models for strength difficulties in the older group. The impact of sex and age was strong in all models and, as with the middle-aged group, women were nearly four times more likely than men to report strength difficulties even after all diseases, conditions, and impairments were considered. In Model 2, all health factors except diabetes and BMI were positively associated with strength difficulties. In Model 3, education was significantly associated, but cognitive impairment lost significance. No significant Sex × Condition interactions were noted for the older respondents although the Sex × BMI interaction was marginally significant. Age-Group Differences. The differences between the age groups were most evident in strength. For the middle-aged group, cardiopulmonary conditions were highly significant and multiple significant Sex × Condition interactions were found. In contrast, age was highly significant in the older group, and only the Sex × BMI interaction showed borderline significance. For both groups, the independent association of female sex remained strong, and there were significant associations of many conditions, depressive symptoms, and lower education. Discussion Our results demonstrated that the association of sex with disability depends on the measure of disability examined. For example, the association of female sex with increased ADL disability was completely (in middle-aged adults) or nearly completely (in older adults) explained by our disease and social covariates. However, sex did exert an indirect effect on ADL disability in older adults through the sex differentials in musculoskeletal conditions and depressive symptoms. In contrast, the direct significant associations of female sex with mobility and strength disability in both age groups were either increased or only mildly attenuated when the disease and social covariates were considered, partially supporting our first hypothesis.Hypothesis 2 was largely disproved. Several interactions of sex with diseases, conditions, and impairments were significantly associated with all of our measures of disability and in both age groups. However, the more significant interactions were not generalized; rather, they were quite specific to covariates or age group. For example, highly significant interactions of female sex and BMI on mobility difficulties were nearly identical in both age groups, indicating that obesity had a more deleterious effect on mobility for women than for men. We found multiple significant interaction effects between sex and diseases or impairments on strength difficulties in the middle-aged group but only one (Sex × BMI) in the older age group. Previous studies indicating that middle-aged adults manifest more heterogeneity in chronic conditions than do older adults may underlie this finding. Strength was affected more strongly by the presence of specific conditions in middle-aged men than it was in women, a somewhat surprising finding. It may be that men's reports of difficulties in middle age are relatively more sensitive to their experiences with most of the diseases, conditions, and impairments that we tested. In contrast, women's greater strength difficulties overall in middle age may be due to other sex-associated factors not tested in our models (e.g., sedentary lifestyles, hormonal changes). Regardless, the differences between men and women in these relationships were quite pronounced for strength difficulties in middle age. This difference virtually disappeared in the older cohort.It is notable that few of the diseases, conditions, and impairments or the demographic and social risk factors explained the strong associations of female sex with mobility and strength difficulties. These sex associations were of strikingly similar magnitudes in both age groups, suggesting common physiological or biomechanical mechanisms that persist over the life course and may be unmeasured in health interview surveys. The association of female sex with mobility and strength decreased only when a female Sex × BMI interaction was added in the older age group, supporting a physiological hypothesis. Alternatively, it is interesting to revisit the finding that the association of female sex with increased ADL disability was apparently accounted for (or nearly so) by our measured covariates, and, in particular, by the disease and impairment measures. Perhaps the crude direct association between sex and ADL disability is less strong to begin with than are the associations between sex and other disability measures, increasing the importance of indirect sex effects. Alternatively, ADL disability may occur so late in the disability trajectory—with mobility and strength difficulties occurring prior (Johnson and Wolinsky 1993   ; Verbrugge and Jette 1993   ; Lawrence and Jette 1996   )—that sex differences earlier in the process are not as important.Although not the primary focus of this study, comparisons of covariates in the HRS and AHEAD models are worth noting. Older age was generally significantly associated with disability for older adults, regardless of controls. This significance may be due in part to the fact that age in the younger group spanned only 10 years (ages 51–61), whereas age in the older group was broader (ages 70–103). Older age may proxy unmeasured diseases, conditions, and impairments for which older adults are increasingly at risk. Lower education was also significant in all but the ADL models in the older group, where we found an independent association with our measure of cognitive performance. Overall, education was a stronger factor in disability for HRS respondents than for AHEAD respondents. The differences between the age groups may be an artifact of age group, where education had already exerted most of its effect on health characteristics over the 70-plus years of the AHEAD respondents. Cardiopulmonary diseases and vision impairment also tended to be highly associated with all measures of disability, more in the younger than in the older age group. Although important for both groups, musculoskeletal conditions had stronger associations for older adults. In addition, mental health impairment was always among the top three associations for both age groups and across all disability measures.Our study findings may be limited by the cross-sectional data and self-reported disease and disability measures we used to take advantage of nationally representative data, large sample sizes in key age groups, and specific methodologies. Thus, our analytic approach limited our ability to examine the roles of disability transitions and mortality. In addition, our survey data did not include biological, physiological, or clinical measures of health or other measures relating to the person–environment fit. Thus, there are many potential missing variables that may underlie our inability to explain increased mobility and strength disability in women. For example, data on diseases that present differently in men and women (e.g., Parkinson's, some types of arthritis) are not appropriately measured. Biomechanical and hormonal differences are also unmeasured. Finally, key details of disease management (e.g., rehabilitation, replacement surgery, and treatment) as well as social and lifestyle covariates (e.g., activity levels, environmental barriers) are not available in these data sets.In summary, this research addressed hypotheses regarding the effect of sex on disability prevalence within an empirical framework that may be used for future research on sex and disability. We found that the relatively weak relationship of sex to ADL disability was explained largely by disease and social covariates, but that the sex effect on mobility and strength disability could not be explained by those same covariates. Unmeasured disability correlates and disability transitions that differ by sex may explain those differences. We found persistent and strong patterns of Sex × Condition interactions that were relatively specific (particularly female sex and BMI) and suggest different physiological determinants of disability in women. The pathophysiological substrates of potential sex differences in the disease to disability pathway as well as the social and psychological variation between the sexes may be key to disability prevention. Ferreting out those variations may mean the difference between effective and ineffective clinical or social interventions and, in turn, the ability of middle-aged and older adults experiencing diseases, conditions, and impairments to live independently in the community.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook ReviewsNotesAlthough HRS and AHEAD respondents were not always asked the same battery of questions for all diseases and conditions, we were able to construct our measures of five categories of life-threatening or disabling chronic conditions based on identical or nearly identical questions in the two surveys. First, we categorized eight common chronic conditions as cardiopulmonary (heart problems, lung disease), musculoskeletal (arthritis, fractured/broken bones/hips), active diabetes, history of stroke, or other (cancer, high blood pressure). We expected that these categories of conditions would impact different capacities (e.g., cardiopulmonary conditions and aerobic capacity, musculoskeletal conditions and strength) and, in turn, different domains of physical functioning. The categories reflected self-reported history or active status in the eight individual conditions. For example, both groups were asked about physician diagnosis of a range of heart problems (e.g., heart attack, congestive heart failure), lung disease, stroke, cancer, and high blood pressure, so the category measures that include these conditions reflect history of diagnosis rather than current status for the conditions. In contrast, because HRS respondents were asked about history of diabetes and active diabetes, whereas AHEAD respondents were only asked about active diabetes, our measure of diabetes is based on active status. Similarly, although HRS respondents were asked about physician diagnosis of arthritis, AHEAD respondents were not; however, because both groups were asked if they had seen a physician within the past year about their arthritis, the latter question was the basis for our measure of active arthritis. Related questions that were somewhat different but tapped the same dimension of health were those associated with fractures or broken bones. HRS respondents were asked if they had fractured or broken any bones since age 45, and AHEAD respondents were asked if they had ever broken a hip.Although there is no consensus on cognitive performance tests that influence a broad range of functioning, we based our measure of low cognitive performance on the sum of the immediate and delayed word recall test scores for two reasons. First, word recall tests largely tap the cognitive dimension of fluid abilities—processing capabilities that affect the ability to acquire new information. Because most studies document that fluid abilities are resource-intensive and decline somewhat with aging, such declines might represent a disadvantage in daily functioning. Second, word recall tests are available in both HRS and AHEAD although the range of scores differed across the studies in the first two waves of data collection. The total word recall score ranged between 0–40 in the HRS respondents, based on 20 nouns to be recalled in each of the immediate and delayed recall tests. In contrast, the total word recall score ranged between 0–20 in the AHEAD respondents, based on 10 nouns to be recalled in each test. We defined the lowest quartile of the self-respondents as the low cognitive performance group (LCP25). This categorization assesses low cognitive performance rather than cognitive impairment or clinical dementia, although the latter (impaired) respondents would be included. Both age groups had significant item nonresponse for the word recall tests. Because AHEAD respondents who could not answer or refused to answer were similar on several characteristics to respondents whose performances were poor (Herzog and Wallace 1997   ), we classified refusers and nonrespondents in the word recall tests for both surveys in the lowest 25th percentile. For other variables, there was very little item nonresponse. Because of scaling differences between HRS and AHEAD, cognitive performance cannot be compared across the two groups. Rather, the findings indicate effects of low cognitive performance relative to cognitive performance in their age peers.The Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES-D), a 20-item self-reported index of current depressive symptoms that is often used in survey research settings, was derived from earlier validated clinical depression scales to tap major feelings or behaviors associated with clinical depression (Kohout, Berkman, Evans, and Cornoni-Huntley 1993   ; Radloff 1977   ). Studies have found that summary scores from the original 20-item CES–D scale and its shorter 8-item relative correlate reasonably well with clinical ratings, although some studies suggest that the CES–D scale may not correlate as well with diagnosed depression in much older persons, compared with middle-aged or young-old adults (Kohout et al. 1993   ). The depressive symptoms measured in the 8-item CES–D scale included feeling depressed, lonely, sad, unhappy, or that everything done required an effort, not enjoying life, not being able to "get going," or having restless sleep.

     Abstract Purpose: Altering negative attitudes associated with ageism may be possible by giving people accurate information about older people in conjunction with reinforcement for change. Design and Methods: Ninety-nine college students (35 men, 63 women; mean age = 20 years, SD = 2.78) participated in one of three groups: information only, information plus an innocuous discussion group, and information plus a reinforcement-to-change discussion group. The participants' attitudes toward elderly people were measured before, immediately after the intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. Changes in attitudes across groups and time were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t tests. Results: Information alone produced initial improvements in attitudes in all groups; however, only the group members who received additional reinforcement for change maintained positive attitude changes at one-month follow-up. Implications:This study supports the premise that negative attitudes toward older people are amendable; however, the new attitude may be lost without reinforcement for change.   Ageism ,  Discrimination ,  Prejudice Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe noted gerontologist Robert Butler introduced the term "ageism" more than 30 years ago. He referred to ageism as a kind of discrimination, similar to racism and sexism, directed toward elderly people (Butler 1969   ). Ageism often results in the attitude that older people are unproductive, sickly, depressing, and that cognitive impairment is normative (Osgood 1996   ; Palmore 1999   ). A few of the most prevalent outcomes of ageism for older people are isolation from the community, inadequate housing and income, unnecessary institutionalization, untreated mental and physical illnesses, and suicide (Healey 1993   ; Palmore 1999   ). Ageism needs to be confronted and overcome, as the problems faced by elderly people are problems for our grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and other older people in our lives, as well as ourselves.One dilemma in combating ageism is that many older people attribute age-related discrimination to other causes. For instance, many older people of ethnic minority backgrounds cite their ethnicity, before their age, as a probable cause for discrimination (McNeely and Cohen 1983   ). Women are likely to attribute discriminatory behavior to sexism before ageism (Macdonald and Rich 1991   ), and White males who have experienced ageism in the job market often attribute the discrimination to outdated skills (Atchley 1994   ). Additionally, "elderly" is a relative term (Atchley 1994   ), and Bernard M. Baruch once said, "to me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am" (Applewhite, Evans, and Frothingham 1992   , p. 182). This leaves few people willing to identify themselves as victims of ageism, which is possibly why it often goes unchecked in the American society (Butler 1993   ). Because few people recognize ageism when confronted with it, and no one agency is responsible for keeping statistics on this form of discrimination, there is no reliable information regarding the frequency or prevalence of ageism (Butler 1993   ).Dychtwald and Flower 1990    assert that whatever phase of life the huge post World War II cohort, or baby boom generation, is currently in, the country becomes transfixed on the relevant issues to that age. They go on to state that this cohort is the least likely to accept ageism in their older age because of their previous success as a group with instituting sweeping policy changes. By researching ways to ameliorate ageism now, there is the possibility of having the knowledge necessary to influence attitude change when this cohort is confronted with ageism. Although not given a great deal of attention at this time (Butler 1993   ), researching ageism as a form of discrimination resulting from negative attitudes allows for the exploration of related theories that may lead to solutions for the current elderly cohort and those who will be aged in the future.Attitude change theorists offer insight into potential methods for improving attitudes toward minority groups. In the cognitive dissonance theory, Festinger 1957    proposes that correct information might create enough cognitive dissonance to warrant a reexamination of attitudes. Additionally, correct information about the elderly population may work with societal expectations that people are supposed to respect their elders and invoke considerable dissonance when people are confronted with their own ageism. The theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975   ) offers insight into whether people will subsequently alter their behavior to be congruent with new attitudes. If a person expects positive outcomes and has social support for the new behavior, he or she will likely try acting differently. Maintenance of new attitudes and non-ageist behavior may then depend on whether the new attitude and behavior are met with positive or negative consequences per operant conditioning (Skinner 1938   ). Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of providing correct information as a means to challenge negative attitudes toward elderly people. In addition, positive reinforcement was used to try to strengthen attitude change. In this study, there were three groups. All participants began the experiment by completing the first administration of the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD; to obtain baseline measurements of attitudes) and then receiving accurate information about older people through a videotape presentation. This was based on the idea that corrective information may cause significant cognitive dissonance requiring change. One group received the information as the sole intervention. This group is referred to as the "information-only" group. A second group, the "information-reinforcement" or I/RG group, discussed the videotape immediately after the presentation and again one week later. The facilitator used verbal reinforcers when participants demonstrated comprehension of accurate information as portrayed in the videotape. This was intended to incorporate operant conditioning as a means to strengthen the likelihood of attitude change. In an attempt to control for the attention received by the second group, the third group also participated in two discussion sessions that took place immediately after the presentation and again, one week later. This group did not receive any reinforcement for talking positively about elderly people. The topic of these discussions involved campus life, and the participants received verbal reinforcers for any appropriate comment. This group is referred to as the "information-campus-life" or I/CL group. Further discussion of the experimental intervention is in the Methods section. Hypotheses At baseline, participants will display negative attitudes about elderly people as evidenced by their low scores on the first administration of the ASD.Following the experimental manipulation, participants' attitudes will be more positive on the second ASD after receiving information about elderly people, as evidenced by higher scores.Participants in the I/RG group will demonstrate the most positive attitudes immediately following intervention when compared to the other groups.At one-month follow-up, participants in the I/RG group will maintain their attitude gains as evidenced by significant differences between their scores on the third ASD when compared to the first. Methods Participants One hundred and twelve participants were from the University of Wyoming psychology department "subject pool" (n = 72), and 40 were volunteers from upper division psychology courses. Experimental group participants earned 2 hours of subject pool credit after the videotape and discussion sessions, and their names were placed in a cash drawing when they completed the follow-up questionnaire. Participants in the information-only group received $5.00 and food for participating in the first session and an additional $5.00 for completing the follow-up questionnaire. Measure Aging Semantic Differential (ASD). The ASD (Rosencranz and McNevin 1969   ) comprises 32-item adjective pairs from the 60-item Semantic Differential (Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum 1957   ). The items are polar-opposite adjectives, scored from 1 (negative evaluation) to 7 (positive evaluation). Examples of the pairs include: Progressive–Old fashioned, Rich–Poor, Friendly–Unfriendly, and Happy–Sad. The measure was developed by having people who worked with elders or were noted to have extensive exposure to older adults rate elderly people on the 60-item Semantic Differential. Factor analysis resulted in retaining 32 pairs that represent three factors: Instrumental–Ineffective, Autonomous–Dependent, and Personal Acceptability–Unacceptability. The coefficient alphas were .89, .87, and .91, respectively. Interventions Information Only. The information-only group completed the ASD pretest, watched the videotape The Myths and Realities of Aging (1993), and immediately completed the post-test. They were excused after watching the video and completing the post-test questionnaire with instructions to return in 4 weeks for the final follow-up. Four weeks later they completed the ASD a third time. Information/Reinforcement (I/RG) Group. The I/RG group completed a pretest, watched the videotape, and then were told that they had entered the second phase of the experiment. During the first discussion session, participants in the I/RG group were encouraged to discuss any information presented in the videotape that challenged currently held beliefs. The facilitator offered verbal reinforcement for appropriate remarks and ignored any off-task comments. During the second session the following week, participants were encouraged and reinforced by the same facilitator for discussing what they remembered from the videotape and how this new information may have changed their attitudes. Each discussion continued for 25 minutes. Information/Campus Life (I/CL). Similar to the I/RG group, the I/CL participants completed the pretest, watched the videotape, and then began the second phase in which they were instructed to discuss their college classes and current events at the university. They received verbal reinforcement by the facilitator for comments related to these topics. The facilitator ignored any references to other issues, such as the videotape. The participants met for a second discussion one week later, engaged in a comparable discussion with the same facilitator, and received similar reinforcement for on-task comments. Each discussion session continued for 25 minutes. Intervention Integrity Group Process. Two questions were used to ensure the intervention process. First, participants were asked to indicate the purpose of their group in a multiple-choice format. Then they rated the amount of information gained and how much they enjoyed the group. All participants correctly identified the purpose of their respective groups. A stepwise multiple regression was performed using group membership as the dependent variable, and the ratings of the information gained and enjoyment of the group as the independent variables. The regression indicated no significant differences in either the amount of information obtained or how much the groups were enjoyed by participants. Video Worksheet. The purpose of the worksheet was to ensure that participants gleaned important information from the videotape The Myths and Realities of Aging. The video worksheet is a content valid knowledge questionnaire based on the videotape. Ninety-six participants answered all questions correctly. The other three participants each missed only one question. Procedure The information-only group completed the consent form, the first ASD, and then watched the information videotape during a regularly scheduled class. After viewing the videotape, they completed the video worksheet, a second ASD, and the group process form. Four weeks later they completed the ASD a third time at the conclusion of a regular class period.The participants composing the I/CL and I/RG groups assembled in one room and were randomly assigned to their groups. Assignment was based on whether they had a red or blue label on the folder they received containing the study forms. All participants completed the consent form, the first ASD, and then watched the videotape. Immediately after the presentation they completed the video worksheet. Participants in the I/CL group exited and regrouped in another room to discuss current issues on campus and met again one week later for a second discussion of campus issues. Participants in the I/RG group also met immediately after the videotape presentation and again one week later. After the second discussion session, participants from both groups completed the ASD and the group process questionnaire. Four weeks after the second discussion session, these two groups met again and completed the final ASD. Results Sample Sixty-eight participants attended the videotape presentation and the first and second discussion sessions. Sixty-six of these participants completed the third ASD at 4-week follow-up. Thirty-three of 35 volunteers for the information-only group attended the 4-week follow-up session. Overall, four people failed to complete the experiment: three women and one man. All data collected from the remaining participants were usable, resulting in complete data from 96% of those who began the study.The final sample included 35 men and 64 women, with a mean chronological age of 20 years (SD = 2.78). Eighty-five participants were Caucasian, 5 were Hispanic, 3 were African American, 2 were Asian, and 4 endorsed "other" or more than one category. Forty-nine of the participants were freshmen, 20 were sophomores, 21 were juniors, and 9 were seniors. There were 33 participants in each group who completed the study. Intervention Integrity The I/RG and I/CL groups were audiotape recorded and coded for facilitator behaviors. The I/CL group members were reinforced 37 times by the facilitator during the first session and 31 times during the second session for making comments about college life. Facilitator words such as "college/university," "campus," "student," and "class" were used 43 times during the first session and 34 times during the second session. No instances of attending to comments about the videotape or about elderly people occurred. Students in the I/RG group were reinforced 42 times by the facilitator during the first discussion session in response to positive comments about elderly people or the videotape. No reinforcers were used in conjunction with comments about campus life. During the second session, the facilitator attended to 29 comments that revealed a positive attitude change by a participant. The facilitator also used target words of "elderly," "older," "aging," and "ageism" 40 times to keep the discussion on the topic of ageism. These were referred to during the first session and 36 times during the second session. Two trained research assistants coded all tapes, and agreement was 96% for the four sessions. There were no significant differences (t test) in total occurrence of reinforcers or target words across the two groups. Overall Attitudes About Elders The mean scores for each group at the three assessment points are shown in  Table 1  . The maximum score on the ASD is 224; each group scored below the midpoint, supporting the hypothesis that participants would have generally negative attitudes about elders. There were no significant differences between groups at the pretest, F(2) = .94, p > .05.Changes in participants' attitudes toward elderly people by group over the course of the experiment were examined using a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA (Group × Time) (Girden 1992   ). The interaction between group and time was significant, F(2) = 9.05, p < .05, as were the main effects for group, F(2) = 5.23, p < .05, and time, F(1) = 5.40, p < .05. The information-only group's attitudes were significantly more positive immediately after observing the videotape than their pretest score, t(32) = 4.17, p < .05, or their 4-week follow-up, t(32) = –.63, p < .05. There was no significant difference between their pretest and 4-week follow-up scores, t(32) = –.08, p > .05. The I/CL group's attitudes followed a similar pattern in that their post-test attitudes were significantly more positive than their pretest score, t(32) = 4.23, p < .05 or their 4-week follow-up, t(32) = –3.91, p < .05. Again, no differences were found between their pretest and 4-week follow-up attitudes, t(32) = –.06, p > .05. The interaction effect was evident in the attitude shifts of the I/RG group. Similar to the other two groups, their immediate post-test attitudes were significantly more positive than both their pretest attitudes, t(32) = 3.93, p < .05). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the post-test and 4-week follow-up attitudes, t(32) = –.08, p > .05) Discussion The goal of this study was to examine whether providing corrective information about older people would change immediate attitudes toward elders (Butler 1993   ; Harmetz 1996   ; Healey 1993   ; Macdonald and Rich 1991   ). This approach is supported by Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory (1957), and our data support this hypothesis. Initially, most of the participants had negative attitudes about older people. Watching a 30-minute videotape was sufficient to significantly increase their overall attitudes above their initial scores and above the median ASD score of 112.It was also hypothesized that attitude changes could be strengthened and maintained by reinforcement—talking about the new information (Skinner 1938   ). Contrary to the first hypothesis, discussions of the information gained about elders did not lead to a further increase in positive attitude change over information alone, as seen by the lack of additional attitude change from post-test to follow-up in the I/RG group. On the other hand, the I/RG group was the only group that maintained their more positive attitudes. It seems that information alone plays the most important role in changing people's attitudes, but reinforcement is necessary for maintenance of that change. This supports the notion that reinforcement encourages people to incorporate new information into their attitudes as predicted by Festinger 1957    and Petty and Cacioppo 1996   . The lack of maintenance of attitude change by the other participants suggests that the dissonance alone was not salient enough to lead to permanent attitude change (Petty and Cacioppo 1996   ).A number of cognitive processes may have occurred to promote maintenance of attitude change. The participants were given reinforcement for their ability to display their understanding of the information during the first session. At the end of this session, the participants were told that at the second session they would be talking about how the video changed their attitude toward elderly people. The knowledge that they were returning for another session and would receive praise if they could offer an example of attitude change may have caused the participants to think about the information during the following week. Because participants had the opportunity to be individually recognized for their attitude change, Petty, Harkins, Williams, and Latane 1977    would predict that the participants would invest more cognitive effort into the task of change. The increased level of cognitive processing would likely be absent in the other two groups (Petty et al. 1977   ). The information-only group understood that their participation was complete after the videotape session; the I/CL group may have paid more attention to campus events so as to have a topic to raise and receive verbal reinforcement from the examiner. In sum, it seems that correct information caused dissonance, but the more in-depth cognitive processing conceivably experienced by the I/RG group may account for those participants' maintained attitude change. Limitations The use of university students as participants may hamper the generalizability to older and non-White samples. The majority of the participants were under 21 years old; these students likely feel that they have nothing in common with older people and therefore find it easier to treat them as the "other" and have negative attitudes (Atchley 1994   ). Young participants may be more susceptible to social pressure in regard to change than people not in their late teens or early twenties. The participants' attitudes toward older people may be more malleable as they likely have limited experience with elders and ageism (Atchley 1994   ; Butler 1993   ; Osgood 1996   ; Palmore 1999   ). In future studies, participants' level of interaction with older people should be measured.Another limitation of this study is the relatively short follow-up. Although the participants of the information-only and I/CL groups did have time to revert to their initial attitudes, it is unclear how lasting the effects will be for those in the I/RG group. This group had maintained their gains after 4 weeks, but may have reverted to old attitudes after an extended period of time, as the dissonance may not have been completely resolved in 4 weeks, and they may have had little direct contact with elderly people.Finally, it is impossible to tease out whether the verbal reinforcement the I/RG group participants received accounts for the maintenance of their attitudes, or if the cognitive processing in the intervening week accounts for the maintenance of their attitudes. Additionally, the changing of attitudes will only prove useful if it ameliorates discriminatory behaviors that are detrimental to the physical and emotional health of older adults (Healey 1993   ; Palmore 1999   ). A more in-depth investigation into whether people alter their discriminatory practices will be the ultimate measure of the utility of this intervention. If the change is lasting and results in new behaviors, people could participate in this type of intervention during their school years, changing attitudes regarding aging in the United States. Finally, if this education and reinforcement proves helpful in reducing ageism, it may also translate into guidance for those looking to rectify other "isms" in the American culture.The ForumBook ReviewsPractice Concepts  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The aim of this research was to derive network types among an elderly population and to examine the relationship of network type to morale. Design and Methods: Secondary analysis of data compiled by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (n = 2,079) was employed, and network types were derived through K-means cluster analysis. Respondents' morale scores were regressed on network types, controlling for background and health variables. Results: Five network types were derived. Respondents in diverse or friends networks reported the highest morale; those in exclusively family or restricted networks had the lowest. Multivariate regression analysis underscored that certain network types were second among the study variables in predicting respondents' morale, preceded only by disability level (Adjusted R2 = .41). Implications: Classification of network types allows consideration of the interpersonal environments of older people in relation to outcomes of interest. The relative effects on morale of elective versus obligated social ties, evident in the current analysis, is a case in point.   Network typology ,  Well-being ,  Social support ,  Israel Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe personal social networks in which older people are embedded are related to several well-being outcomes in later life (Antonucci and Akiyama 1987   ; Gallo 1984   ; Wenger 1996   ). One's social network can affect a range of feelings, such as sense of morale, notions of self-worth, and life satisfaction (Barrett 1999   ; Lang and Baltes 1997   ; Lee and Ishii-Kuntz 1987   ; Wilson, Calsyn, and Orlofsky 1994   ). Networks also influence a variety of behaviors, as, for example, older people's utilization of health and social services (Bass and Noelker 1987   ; Bear 1989   ; Logan and Spitze 1994   ; Wan 1987   ).A summary network measure with significant potential for use by gerontological practitioners and researchers is the notion of network type (Wenger 1991   ). This construct encompasses a set of key structural and interactional network variables that collectively distinguish major groupings in the population of interest. Initial investigations into this area indicate, moreover, that one's network type can be quite predictive of several important outcomes (Bond et al. 1998   ; Litwin 1998   ; Wenger 1997   ). However, although study of network types and their impact is an area of inquiry with considerable potential for informing gerontological practice, there is still relatively little research available on this topic.The current study addressed this gap in the literature. Based upon secondary analysis of data drawn from a national representative sample of persons aged 60 and older in Israel, the study had two primary aims. The first was to derive a collection of coherent and distinguishable network types among an elderly population. The second was to examine the relationship of the resultant network types to respondents' morale, a primary indicator of well-being in later life. A multiple regression analysis was thus conducted, in order to test how the independent contribution of network type impacts morale controlling for demographic and health characteristics. Literature Review Social networks are the collection of interpersonal ties that people of all ages maintain in varying contexts. While such ties may or may not be supportive, the terms "support network" and "social network" are often used interchangeably in the gerontological literature to refer to the same social aggregate (Wenger 1996   ). Also, a number of different approaches are employed by researchers for the derivation or mapping of social networks (Van der Poel 1993   ). These methodological differences tend to produce varying foci in studies of the network phenomenon. Thus, while there is agreement regarding the importance of social networks to older people, the specific factors found to correlate with social network have been seen to vary according to the definition of social network adopted and the method of network analysis utilized.In an attempt to focus gerontological network research on the most relevant of the network components in a parsimonious manner, Wenger 1991    has drawn attention to the concept of network type. This construct allows for the identification of differing meaningful interpersonal environments in later life, as measured by a collection of core social network variables. The notion of network type is thus represented in a series of unique characterizations of sets of social ties, often referred to as a network typology.The key network determinants that most frequently constitute the basis for network type delineation include both structural components, such as member counts and composition profiles, and interactional components, such as measures of contact frequency or tie duration. Wenger 1996    systematically derived a network typology of elderly people in Wales, based upon three differentiating criteria: the availability of local close kin; frequency of contact with family, friends, and neighbors; and levels of social integration in community groups.Five network types were distinguished in that effort. The family-dependent network was a small grouping that relied primarily on close family members. The locally integrated network was a large grouping that included relationships with family, neighbors, and friends. The local self-contained network tended to be small and mostly neighbor-based. The wider-community-focused network was large and primarily friendship-centered. Finally, the private-restricted network was characterized by an absence of local kin, and only minimal ties with neighbors.These network types were subsequently replicated in England, Germany, and The Netherlands (Scharf and Wenger 1995   ). Other network typologies, each using unique criteria, have been noted in Australia (Mugford and Kendig 1986   ), Canada (Stone and Rosenthal 1996   ), and Finland (Melkas and Jylha 1996   ). The network types identified in the various typologies exhibit several similarities, especially in regard to composition, along with some characteristic differences.Social network variables in general, and network type in particular, are highly correlated with a range of sociodemographic variables. The nature of these relationships may differ across populations, however (Wenger 1995   ). Thus, it has been generally established that people with higher education and those with higher incomes have larger networks (Fischer 1982   ). These same traits tend to be associated with networks composed of larger proportions of non-kin (Wenger 1996   ).As for marital state, currently married older persons tend to have larger networks than the unmarried (Van Tilburg 1995   ). Unmarried elderly men who live alone tend to have the smallest networks of all, on average. Age and functional status are also associated with network characteristics. The old-old tend to have smaller networks than the young-old (Litwin and Landau 2000   ). Physical impairment is similarly related to network reduction. For example, impaired older adults in a national sample in the United States were found to report both fewer friendship contacts and fewer family contacts (Newsom and Schulz 1996   ).Social networks are particularly important, given their observed associations in numerous studies with well-being outcomes, in general, and with morale, in particular. In an analysis of subjects aged 60 and older from Fischer 1982    Northern California data, for example, Baldassare, Rosenfield, and Rook 1984    found that a sizable proportion of the variance in respondents' unhappiness scores was predicted by their social relations, even after controlling for background and health characteristics. In a more recent German study, Lang and Baltes 1997    found that social contact was positively associated with life satisfaction among nonimpaired elders. This was not the case, however, for elderly persons who experienced difficulties in performing activities of daily living.Lee and Ishii-Kuntz 1987    found that the morale of persons aged 55 and older in Washington State increased as their interaction with friends increased. This was also true, but to a lesser degree, regarding their interaction with neighbors. No relationship was found, on the other hand, between interaction with adult children and morale. In regard to this last point, in fact, Snell and Matthews 1986    found that very frequent family interactions among retired residents of Ontario actually lowered their morale level, even when controlling for health and income.In a later study of widowed and never-married Canadian elders, Matthews 1991    found a relationship between perceived support and morale. However, that same analysis found no relationship between the availability of family and friends, on the one hand, and respondents' morale, on the other. In fact, morale was found to be higher in selected cases among persons who relied more on themselves than upon their social support networks.In research that specifically examined the relationship of network type and morale, significant associations were uncovered. Bond and colleagues 1998    employed the Wenger network typology in a study of long-term stroke and hip fracture patients in six hospitals in England. They found that social support network type was indeed strongly associated with anxiety, but not with depression. In an attempt to isolate the variables most predictive of morale in old age, Wenger, Davies, and Shahtahmasebi 1995    applied multivariate regression analysis to a wide set of predictor variables. Their results showed that the variable of network type was one of the few factors retained in the refined predictive model.Morale in old age is also related to sociodemographic variables and to health characteristics. A brief review of selected sources reveals some characteristic correlations. First, educational level is consistently associated with morale: The higher the education, the better one's morale among a range of populations (McKenzie and Campbell 1987   ; Moon 1996   ). Income is similarly associated (Scott and Kivett 1985   ; Wenger 1995   ). Gender is also considered to be predictive, with women being at greater risk of having poorer psychological well-being (Smith and Baltes 1998   ). However, the gender variable is frequently found to be secondary in its predictive value when other factors are taken into account. In contrast, the literature clearly underscores the predictive strength of disability vis à vis morale. The greater the disability among elderly respondents, the lower their reported morale (Kisely and Shannon 1999   ; Lamb 1996   ).This review suggests that different social network types in later life may be discerned and that they are associated with different levels of morale. Given the association of network type with variables that impact directly upon morale, such as sociodemographic and health characteristics, the question remains whether social networks have an independent effect on morale, above and beyond that of the other predictive factors. This question is examined in the research that unfolds in the following sections. Methods This study employed secondary analysis of data compiled in a comprehensive survey executed by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The survey, carried out in 1997, queried a representative national sample of people aged 60 and older on a wide range of topics, including the nature of their interpersonal relations and selected measures of well-being. The data allowed subsequent focused examination of several key social network components and the identification of network types. These data also made it possible to examine the hypothesis that network type is related to morale in old age.The sample addressed in the current analysis comprised community-dwelling older Jewish persons who had resided in Israel from 1990 and earlier. This cutoff date was selected so as to exclude from the study sample immigrants from the former Soviet Union who began arriving in large numbers that year, and whose social networks were unique in several ways, due to the dynamics of migration (Litwin 1995   ). The population of elderly Arabs, who compose a minority of the elderly cohort in Israel, was also excluded from the analysis, because of its culturally unique social network attributes (Litwin and Haj-Yahia 1996   ).In cases in which more than one elderly person in the original survey sample had been drawn from the same household unit, one elder was randomly selected for analysis. This was done in order to guarantee independent observations among respondents. The resultant study sample stood at N = 2,079. Study Variables The principal independent variable of interest in the analysis was network type. The network type construct was derived through the use of K-means cluster analysis in which designated criterion variables are employed to identify relatively homogeneous groupings in a given population. The procedure uses an algorithm that can handle a large number of cases. Initial cluster centers are assigned for each of the criterion variables and are then iteratively updated until optimal groupings are achieved based upon Euclidean distance. (For a further review of the recommendations used for running the K-means cluster analyses in the current study, see Milligan and Cooper 1987   , and Rapkin and Luke 1993   .)This statistical procedure is essentially an exploratory one, insofar as the researcher selects the number of clusters to be derived in each trial. In the current analysis, cluster combinations of 4, 5, and 6 were tested, based upon the number of cluster solutions obtained in previous research on network types in three different countries (Litwin and Landau 2000   ; Melkas and Jylha 1996   ; Stone and Rosenthal 1996   ). After considering the various cluster combinations, the 5-cluster solution was deemed the most robust and the most reflective of trends found in the literature.Seven variables identified as among the principal structural and interactional components of social networks of older people served as the differentiating criteria for the derivation of the network types (Berkman and Syme 1979   ; Lubben 1988   ; Wenger 1991   ). They included: respondents' current marital status; the number of adult children residing in the elder's vicinity, hereafter referred to as proximate children; frequency of contact on the part of the elder with his or her adult children; frequency of contact with friends; frequency of contact with neighbors; frequency of attendance at a synagogue; and frequency of attendance at a social club.Current marital status was considered in dichotomous terms: (0 = widowed, divorced, separated, or never married; 1 = married). The variable thus essentially reflects whether the respondent was living with a spouse at the time of the survey. The number of proximate children was obtained through a simple count (0–10). Frequency of contact with children, friends, and neighbors was measured on a scale of 0–5, the highest score reflecting daily or almost daily contact, and the lowest score, no contact. Frequency of attendance at a synagogue and at a social club was measured on a scale of 1–5, the highest score reflecting daily or almost daily attendance, and the lowest score, no attendance. All frequency ratings were measured on the CBS survey instrument as general assessments and were not linked to a specific time frame.The characteristics of the five distinct network types and the relative frequencies of each of the network types are presented in  Table 1  . The network types in this study sample all included a familial base, that is, at least one proximate adult child was present, on average, in each of the network types. This finding is supported by comparative network research by Fischer and Shavit 1995   , who found that social networks in Israel are denser and composed more frequently of family ties than are social networks in California. Nevertheless, clear network variations above and beyond the common familial base became evident in the analysis.The network type termed the "diverse" network was the most relatively endowed with a variety of sources of potential support ( Table 1  ). Its members were largely married, had one proximate child on average, enjoyed very frequent contact with children, friends, and neighbors, and attended the synagogue to a moderate degree. The diverse network was also the most prevalent among the network types in the sample.The friends network is somewhat similarly endowed as its predecessor. However, it is different in one important way: Its members reported having only minimal contact with neighbors. The friends network type was also quite prevalent.The defining characteristics of the neighbors network show that fewer of its members had a spouse compared to the elders in the two preceding network types. Moreover, elders in this network reported frequent contact with adult children and with neighbors, but not with friends. The neighbors network was thus a slightly less endowed grouping. It was also somewhat less prevalent in the sample.The family network was the least prevalent of all the network types. It was unique, moreover, in that its members reported having an average of five proximate children, very frequent contact with them, and frequent synagogue attendance. On the other hand, elderly people in the family network had only minimal ties with neighbors and friends.The last of the network types is termed the restricted network, insofar as its members cited the most relatively limited extent of social ties. The focal elder in this network type was most likely to be without a spouse, had the least relative contact with adult children, and almost no contact at all with friends or neighbors. The restricted network type characterized about a fifth of the sample.The dependent variable in the analysis was respondents' reported morale, as measured by the scores obtained upon a 12-item scale constructed for the CBS survey. The measure included positive probes, such as "Do you feel happy, on the whole?" and negative probes, such as "Do you ever feel there is little reason to live?" Respondents indicated agreement (1) or lack of agreement (0) with each probe. Scale scores ranged from 0–12: the higher the score, the higher the reported morale. The measure obtained a Cronbach's alpha score of α = .87, indicating high internal reliability. Respondents in this sample obtained an average scale score of 8.8 (SD = 3.2), indicating that they were in fairly good spirits, on the whole.As alluded to earlier, the analysis also took into account background characteristics that were potentially related to morale scores, to network type, or to both. Age was measured in the original survey on a 7-stage ordinal scale that reflected six 5-year categories from 60–64 through 85–89, and one additional category for those aged 90 and older. According to the planners of the CBS survey, exact birth years were not solicited in order to prevent subsequent identification of specific respondents by unauthorized authorities, and to guarantee confidentiality. The median age of respondents in the study sample fell within the category of 70–74 years old (range = 1–7, mean = 3.2, SD =1.7).As for ethnicity, almost 90% of the elderly respondents in the sample were born outside Israel. The elderly Jewish cohort in Israel is split mainly between people of European immigrant background and persons originally from Asia or Africa, who are known as Easterners. Accordingly, respondents' country of origin was collapsed into categories reflecting the major ethnic divisions in Jewish Israeli society: Europe or America (European), Asia or Africa (Eastern), and Israel (persons born in the area that now constitutes the State of Israel). About one half of the current sample comprised European immigrants (51.9%); more than one third, Eastern immigrants; and about one tenth, Israeli-born.Respondents' education and income levels were recorded in the CBS survey in ordinal fashion. Education was measured on a 5-category scale, from 1–4 years of schooling to 16 years or more. The median level of schooling of respondents in this sample was secondary school or less (range = 0–5, mean = 2.5, SD = 1.4). Income was recorded on a 9-category scale, ranging from a minimal annual income level of about $4,200 (in Israeli shekels) to over $33,000. The median income level in the sample fell in the third category, reflecting a fairly low annual income on the whole (range = 1–9, mean = 3.7, SD = 2.2). Respondents' gender was also taken into account as a background variable (0 = women; 1 = men). Male respondents in the study sample were slightly overrepresented (51.6%).The health status of respondents was measured on a disability scale similar to the 5-item Physical Activity Scale employed in the Yale Health and Aging Project (Cornoni-Huntley et al. 1985   ). Respondents indicated the degree of difficulty they had in carrying out five activities: pushing a large object, stooping, lifting, reaching, and using a delicate instrument. Unlike the original Yale measure, the scale in use by the CBS solicited a 3-level response: (1) able to perform the task with no difficulty whatsoever; (2) able to perform the task, but with difficulty; and (3) unable to perform the task. The resultant scale score ranged from 5–15: the higher the score, the greater the disability (Cronbach's α = .87). The average disability score in the sample was 8.5, reflecting a low to moderate degree of physical difficulty, on the whole (SD = 3.1). Analysis The aim of the analysis was to clarify the nature and the extent of the assumed relationship between network type and morale. Toward this end, bivariate associations between the network type variable and the morale measure were examined by means of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffé group mean comparisons. Bivariate associations were also examined between the background variables and both network type and morale scores, in order to identify the characteristics to be controlled for in the final stage of the analysis. Cross-tabulations, one-way ANOVA, and correlations were performed in this regard, as appropriate to the respective levels of measurement.In the final stage, multivariate regression analysis was executed. The morale score served as the dependent variable in this analysis. Categorical background variables and network types were entered as dichotomous dummy variables. The last of the five network types, the restricted network, was chosen as the base for the network comparisons. Thus, it is not included in the regression procedure. Results The first round of results to be reported is the relationships between the background variables and network type. As shown in  Table 2  , the different network types were characteristically different on all of the background variables. First to be noted are the categorical variables, gender and ethnicity. The percentages show that the focal elders in almost two thirds of the neighbors networks were women. A majority of the focal elders in the diverse and friends networks, on the other hand, were men. The family and restricted network types revealed only slight gender differences.Comparisons by ethnicity revealed additional differences across network type. The vast majority of respondents located in a family network type were Easterners. On the other hand, this ethnic grouping was underrepresented in the friends and diverse network types, in which both European immigrants and Israeli-born older persons were overrepresented. The composition of the neighbors and restricted network types was similar to the general distributions concerning country of origin, except for a somewhat lower relative proportion of members who were born in Israel.Also presented in  Table 2  are the results of the ANOVA of the ordinal variables, with network type employed as the discriminating variable. The average age, education, income, and disability level of respondents differed significantly by network type. The results of the Scheffé mean comparisons (not shown in the table) reveal just how the network types differed.First, in terms of age, the mean comparisons revealed two major divisions. People in family, diverse, and friends networks were much younger than those located in restricted networks, in general. Two major divisions also emerged in regard to income. Respondents in the diverse and friends networks had higher incomes, and those in the three remaining network types had lower incomes.More subtle variations were observed in regard to education, a variable in which three subgroups were discerned. The lowest educational attainment was recorded among people in the family network, who had partial primary schooling only. The next schooling level, some secondary school on average, was noted among persons in the neighbors and restricted networks. The highest average educational level was observed among members of the diverse and friends network types, who reported at least a secondary school education.Finally, three subgroups emerged when comparing disability level. The least degree of disability was observed among persons in the diverse and friends networks. A middle level of disability was recorded among the members of the neighbors network. Those in the family and restricted network types, on the other hand, had the greatest reported difficulty in carrying out basic physical tasks.In summary, people in diverse networks were more likely to be elderly men of European background with higher incomes, higher education, and little disability. Those in the friends network shared these same characteristics, but tended to be younger. The neighbors network type was composed most frequently of lower income women. People in the family network were more likely to be Easterners and to have lower incomes, less education, and greater disability despite their younger age. Those in the restricted network were likely to have lower incomes, less education, and greater disability, and were likely to be older as well. Table 2  also presents the examination of the bivariate relationship between network type and morale—the dependent well-being outcome measure of interest in this analysis. The table shows that there are significant differences by network type. In addition, the Scheffé mean comparisons point to three distinctive subgroupings. Respondents in the restricted and family networks had the lowest average morale among all the people in the study sample. Members of the neighbors network reported a middle range of morale scores. The highest morale was observed among persons in the diverse and friends network types.Insofar as morale in later life is also generally related to sociodemographic background characteristics of older people, it was necessary to consider these relationships in the current analysis. Bivariate associations between morale scores and the background variables were examined by means of Pearson correlations. For this purpose, the ethnicity variable was converted into two dummy dichotomous measures, (1 = Europeans, 0 = others; 1 = Easterners, 0 = others). The third ethnic grouping, Israeli-born elders, was chosen as the base for comparisons and is not included in the correlations or in the regression procedure. As shown in  Table 3  , all the background variables were significantly related to morale.  Table 3  shows a negative relationship between age and morale. As for gender, the men in this sample had higher average morale scores than the women. It is also evident that European immigrants had slightly higher morale, and Easterners had significantly lower morale. A positive relationship emerged, on the other hand, between morale and both income and education. Finally, disability level was negatively correlated with the morale score.Given that the background characteristics addressed in this analysis were significantly related to both network type and to morale, multivariate regression analysis was required in order to consider further the nature of the observed relationship between network type and morale. The results of the procedure are displayed in  Table 4  . The variable that explained the greatest amount of the variance in the morale scores, as reflected in the weight of the beta statistic, was respondents' level of disability. However, second among all the variables in predictive strength were two network types, the diverse and friends networks; that is, the kind of interpersonal environment in which the older people in this sample were embedded accounted for greater explained variance in their morale than such factors as age and income. Neighbors network types were also positively associated with morale, but less so, and family networks much less so. When all the variables were taken into consideration, neither gender, ethnicity, nor education had an observed independent effect on morale. The model examined in this analysis was statistically significant and explained a considerable amount of the variance in respondents' morale scores. Discussion The results of the study demonstrate that it is, indeed, possible to identify meaningful social network types in a large probability sample of elderly persons. The statistical procedure employed in this effort—cluster analysis—allowed classification of five major social network groupings in the population of elderly Jews in Israel. Moreover, these network types bear several similarities to the major social network types derived in other cultures.The similarities are particularly evident when comparing the network types derived in this analysis with those disclosed in the work by Wenger and colleagues (Scharf and Wenger 1995   ). For example, the diverse network identified in the current analysis is quite comparable to Wenger's locally integrated network type, a similarly large grouping reflecting relationships with family, neighbors, and friends. The friends network derived in the current effort recalls the wider-community-focused network found in the British context. Both are largely friendship-centered. The Israeli neighbors network is similar, in turn, to the local self-contained network in the Wenger typology, which is small and mostly neighbor-based.While the family network that emerged from the Israeli data seems, at first, to be a culturally unique grouping, it is nevertheless comparable to Wenger's family-dependent network. Both rely primarily on close family members. Finally, the restricted network in Israel recalls the private-restricted network in the Wenger typology, both of which are characterized by minimal ties only.Comparison of the relative frequencies of the network types in the different contexts reveals some similarities and some differences. As recalled, the diverse and friends networks constituted over half the Israeli sample. The comparative network types in Wenger's studies had a similar joint frequency, although the internal distribution of the two types differed (Wenger 1996   ). Another British study underscored the prevalence of the locally integrated network, the type most similar to the dominant diverse network type in the current analysis (Wilcox, Jones, and Alldrick 1995   ). On the other hand, neighbors and restricted networks were found in the current study to be more relatively prevalent in Israel, whereas family networks in the Israeli sample were less prevalent than those reported in the United Kingdom.A second contribution of this study was confirmation of the relationship of the construct of network type to morale in later life, even when controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics. In fact, selected network types were second in predictive power among all the study variables. The most predictive factor of morale was respondents' disability, a point that will be addressed.The analysis underscored the positive association of two particular network types with morale—the diverse and friends networks. These findings match results reported by Wenger and colleagues, in which the locally integrated and the wider-community-focused network types were among the variables most associated with high morale (Wenger 1995   ). Additional support for these findings can be cited from the research literature.Lee and Shehan 1989    maintain, for example, that friendship interaction is positively related to self-esteem. Interaction with kin, on the other hand, is not. Lee and Ishii-Kuntz 1987    explain that friendship interaction impacts positively upon morale because such kinds of exchange stem from choice. Family interaction, in contrast, is guided by norms of obligation and does not necessarily constitute a means for positive morale in old age.Viewing the results in the present study, one can discern the above-mentioned trends. The diverse and friends network types are the only two of the network types to include friendship ties. Correspondingly, respondents in these two networks had the highest relative morale scores. The neighbors network reported a middle-range morale score, on average. Although relations with neighbors are based less upon choice than friendship ties, they nevertheless reflect lesser obligation than do family relations. Indeed, respondents in the two kin-based networks in the current study—the family and the restricted networks—achieved the lowest average morale scores.Classification of network types allows comprehensive consideration of the interpersonal environments of older people in relation to outcomes of interest. The composite network type construct employed in this study permits both overall assessment of network differences, as well as specific consideration of given network factors. The relative effects on morale of elective versus obligated social ties, as became evident in the current analysis, is a case in point.A word is required regarding the other findings in the study, and principally, the dominant influence of health and disability on morale in old age. The current analysis emphasized, once again, that disability in later life tends to correlate with lower morale (Kisely and Shannon 1999   ; Lamb 1996   ). Given the strength of the relationship between disability and morale, the fact that network type was found, after all, to maintain an independent relationship with morale must be stressed. Even after controlling for the effect of disability, the personal social network constituted a significant influence upon the subjective well-being of the elderly respondents in this study.Surprisingly, in the current analysis the gender variable did not prove to maintain an independent influence on respondents' morale, as may have been expected (Smith and Baltes 1998   ). The lack of observed gender differences in relation to morale reflects earlier findings of Scott and Kivett 1985   . In a study of morale among widows and widowers, they found that perceived financial status and health outweighed the influence of gender.The lack of ethnic differences in this same regard finds some support in work by McKenzie and Campbell 1987   . In examining the relationship between race and subjective well-being among older Americans, they considered two well-being measures: happiness and morale. The results of their inquiry showed that most of the effects of race on well-being were mediated by health status and by the problems experienced by respondents.A limitation of the survey on which the current analysis is based was its cross-sectional nature. Given the single point of data collection, it was not possible to consider the phenomenon of network shifts among respondents or the potential impact of such shifts upon morale in old age. Indeed, network stability has been a target of some recent network research, within the framework of life-course related inquiry (Van Tilburg 1998   ). Nevertheless, examination of the association of network type and subjective well-being is of value, even if it is limited to a particular period in respondents' lives. Moreover, the large probability sample employed here allowed simultaneous consideration of a wide range of factors. This analytic latitude might not have been possible in an extended longitudinal design, given the possibility of age-related attrition in such samples.Beyond the importance of network type as a predictor of morale in later life, the use of this construct can contribute to policy development and to gerontological service planning. Estimation of the number of persons in restricted networks, for example, can serve in assessing the extent of need for formal support services. In addition, identification of particular individuals in restricted networks can alert service personnel to older people at risk. Further research is needed, therefore, both in regard to the various correlates of network type and to the implications of network type for social policy planning and service delivery to older people.The Forum  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine if simply providing nursing facilities with comparative quality performance information and education about quality improvement would improve clinical practices and subsequently improve resident outcomes, or if a stronger inter-vention, expert clinical consultation with nursing facility staff, is needed. Design and Methods: Nursing facilities (n = 113) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: workshop and feedback reports only, workshop and feedback reports with clinical consultation, and control. Minimum Data Set (MDS) Quality Indicator (QI) feedback reports were prepared and sent quarterly to each facility in intervention groups for a year. Clinical consultation by a gerontological clinical nurse specialist (GCNS) was offered to those in the second group. Results: With the exception of MDS QI 27 (little or no activity), no significant differences in resident assessment measures were detected between the groups of facilities. However, outcomes of residents in nursing homes that actually took advantage of the clinical consultation of the GCNS demonstrated trends in improvements in QIs measuring falls, behavioral symptoms, little or no activity, and pressure ulcers (overall and for low-risk residents). Implications: Simply providing comparative performance feedback is not enough to improve resident outcomes. It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly.   MDS data ,  Nursing homes ,  Outcomes Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDConsiderable effort has been devoted to improving quality of care for nursing home residents. Elaborate state and federal systems have been developed to protect the public and assure at least minimal standards of quality (Zimmerman et al. 1995   ). Since 1990, federal mandates have directed nursing homes nationwide to conduct quality improvement activities. While quality improvement activities are commonly believed to affect resident outcomes, limited research has supported this premise (Harrington and Carrillo 1999   ; Sainfort, Ramsay, and Monato 1995   ). Nonetheless, feedback reports comparing outcomes of one organization to another have become commonplace in quality improvement. To date, they have received limited evaluation (Anderson et al. 1998   ). To test the benefit of feedback in a quality improvement model, we designed and conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if (a) simply providing nursing facilities with comparative quality performance information and education about quality improvement would improve clinical practices and subsequently improve resident outcomes, or (b) a stronger intervention, such as expert clinical consultation with nursing facility staff, is needed to improve outcomes. Mandate for Quality Improvement in Nursing Homes The public, consumer organizations, regulators, and the nursing home industry continue to debate the quality of nursing home care in the United States. Historically, in response to concerns about poor care, federal and state governments have instituted a wide variety of regulations, including licensure, certification, inspection of care, minimum qualifications of nursing home personnel, and ombudsmen programs organized under the Older Americans Act (R. A. Kane 1988   ; R. L. Kane 1995   ). Despite those efforts initiated in the 1970s and 1980s, recent media attention and presidential initiatives to address nursing home problems suggest that quality problems persist (Pear 2000   ).In 1983, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) began a 2-year study of nursing home quality. The report, Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes (Committee on Nursing Home Regulation, Institute of Medicine 1986   ), resulted in Congress mandating, in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87), several provisions intended to improve nursing home care. These provisions included developing The Minimum Data Set for Resident Assessment and Care Screening (MDS), mandating routine use of the MDS for all nursing home residents, and requiring that a quality assurance and assessment process be used in all nursing homes to improve the quality of care (McElroy and Herbelin 1989   ). This standardized resident assessment process was envisioned to improve resident care through the formulation of a resident-specific care plan; to provide nursing home management with resident-level data for monitoring case mix, staffing, and quality of care performance; and to provide regulators with data for case mix, sampling for survey processes, monitoring resident outcomes, and utilization review for Medicare or Medicaid eligibility.The IOM concluded that "regulation is necessary but not sufficient for high-quality care" (Committee on Nursing Home Regulation, Institute of Medicine 1986   , p. 24). The committee further resolved that nursing home staff members need to be well trained, well supervised, and highly motivated to deliver quality services to residents. The committee pointed out that "process measures (of quality) should not be ignored" (p. 55) and that resident outcomes are adversely affected when care delivery processes are overlooked or executed inadequately by staff.Ten years later, another IOM committee reinforced the importance of staffing in nursing homes and concluded that the "quality of care provided by some nursing facilities still leaves much to be desired" (Committee on the Adequacy of Nurse Staffing in Hospitals and Nursing Homes, Institute of Medicine 1996   , p. 140). The committee called for continued research that "could improve both the processes and the outcomes of care" (p. 140). Information Feedback to Improve Quality Information feedback is being used to improve the quality of care in health care settings. There is some evidence that providers will change their styles of practice when presented with data comparing their practice style to their colleagues' (Buck and White 1974   ; Gehlbach et al. 1984   ; Keller, Chapin, and Soule 1990   ). Most of the studies, however, have involved changing physician practice patterns or quality improvement strategies in hospitals (Balas et al. 1996   ; Berwick and Coltin 1986   ; Horowitz et al. 1996   ; Myers and Gleicher 1991   ; Parrino 1989   ). Other studies show that such feedback can change behavior, improving the quality of care delivered (Frame, Kavolich, and Llewellyn 1984   ; Hamley et al. 1981   ). Two comprehensive reviews of feedback of auditing results of practice patterns conclude that performance of health care providers can be generally affected to a small or moderate degree; however, complementary interventions to enhance the effectiveness of audit and feedback have yet to be adequately tested (Thomson O'Brien et al. 2000a   , Thomson O'Brien et al. 2000b   ). Although comprehensive applications in nursing homes have not been conducted, initial success of comparative drug utilization information feedback to nursing homes supports the premise that information feedback using comparative reports may also help change practice behavior in nursing homes (Zimmerman, Collins, Lipowski, and Sainfort 1994   ).Systematic evaluations of individual long-term care organizations suggest that feedback of quality measurement information to staff resulted in better care processes and outcomes (Dennik-Champion, Mareno, and Carlson 1994   ; Miller and Rantz 1989   , Miller and Rantz 1991   , Miller and Rantz 1995   ; Roberts, LeSage, and Radtke-Ellor 1987   ). One randomized trial provided feedback on quality measurement information to staff in 60 Canadian nursing homes, resulting in performance changes and improvement in quality indicator conditions of hazardous mobility and constipation (Mohide et al. 1988   ). Clinical Consultation to Improve Quality in Nursing Homes Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of on-site clinical consultation by a nurse expert to help nursing home staff implement changes to improve care. The use of advanced practice nurses to work with nursing home staff to implement research-based protocols resulted in improvement or less decline in incontinence, pressure ulcers, and aggressive behavior (Ryden et al. 2000   ). Educational programming and resident-centered consultation were found to reduce the use of physical restraints in nursing homes without subsequent increases in staffing or resident injury (Ejaz, Folmar, Kaufmann, Rose, and Goldman 1994   ; Evans et al. 1997   ; Neufeld et al. 1995   , Neufeld et al. 1999   ; Strumpf, Evans, Wagner, and Patterson 1992   ; Werner, Koroknay, Braun, and Cohen-Mansfield 1994   ). Similarly, consultation was shown to reduce falls in nursing homes (Ray et al. 1997   ). However, some of these studies and others have demonstrated that follow-through by the nursing home staff to the recommendations made during consultation and sustained use of the recommended interventions over time may be difficult to achieve (Ouslander et al. 1995   ; Schnelle, Newman, White, et al. 1993   ; Schnelle, Ouslander, Osterweil, and Blumenthal 1993   ). Quality Indicators and the MDS Another approach to quality improvement in nursing facilities has been to develop key indicators that assess care delivered. Such indicators have centered on the concept of sentinel health events such as accidents, transfers to hospitals, medication usage, infections, pressure ulcers, catheters, contractures, tube feedings, restraint usage, or lack of participation in activity programs (Phillips 1991   ; Shaw and Whelan 1989   ; Zinn, Aaronson, and Rosko 1993   ). Accordingly, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has a basic strategy to develop a system of quality indicators (QIs) across the full range of services paid for by the Medicare and Medicaid programs (Gagel 1995   ; Jencks 1995   ).Mandated by OBRA 87, MDS data are routinely obtained for all nursing home residents nationwide upon admission to all nursing facilities participating in Medicaid and/or Medicare, at times of significant change in condition of the resident, quarterly, and annually. Several authors have recommended using MDS data to facilitate quality improvement in nursing facilities (Schnelle 1997   ; Schnelle, Ouslander, Osterweil, et al. 1993   ; Spuck 1992   ). Data from the MDS are resident-level assessment information that can be aggregated for comparison across units within a nursing home or across nursing homes. As part of the HCFA Multistate Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration Project (NHCMQ), Zimmerman and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison have developed a series of MDS-based QIs through a systematic process involving extensive interdisciplinary clinical input, empirical testing, and field testing (Ryther, Zimmerman, and Kelly-Powell 1994   , Ryther, Zimmerman, and Kelly-Powell 1995   ; Zimmerman et al. 1995   ). The most current version includes 30 MDS QIs, measuring such areas as accidents, incontinence, physical function, skin care, cognitive functioning, and behavior (Karon and Zimmerman 1996   ). Nationally, 24 of the 30 were implemented by HCFA nationwide in 1999 for use in the nursing home survey and certification process. Initial field tests and MDS QI validation studies indicate that they provide valuable information about specific residents, specific nursing homes, and nursing facilities in aggregate (Gagel 1995   ; Karon and Zimmerman 1996   , Karon and Zimmerman 1997   ; Rantz et al. 1996   ; Ryther et al. 1994   , Ryther et al. 1995   ; Zimmerman et al. 1995   ).Missouri, the state in which this study was conducted, has been collecting MDS data from nursing facilities since the early 1990s. Working cooperatively with the state's major research university, the state survey and certification agency began analyzing MDS QIs with the intent of providing useful facility-level reports, based on MDS data, that would assist facilities to improve quality of care (Rantz et al. 1996   ; Rantz, Popejoy, Mehr, et al. 1997   ). Plans for comparative MDS QI feedback reports for nursing home providers began several years before the national plans for MDS QI reports that became available to facilities in March 1999. Methods Design Using a three-group randomized experimental design, this study tested whether a quality improvement intervention of comparative quality performance information feedback influenced quality of care delivered and resident outcomes, as measured by MDS QIs. The effect of providing expert clinical consultation to assist facility staff as they interpreted their comparative quality performance information and implemented quality improvement activities also was tested. Feedback Report Quality performance information was derived from MDS resident assessment data. MDS QIs were calculated using the methods developed in the NHCMQ (CHSRA 1995   ). A key assumption is that MDS QIs can be used effectively by facility staff to improve resident care, if the MDS QI report is easy to interpret and appropriate clinical consultation and support are provided (Rantz, Petroski, Madsen, Scott, et al. 1997   ; Rantz et al. 1999   , Rantz et al. 2000   ). The research team designed and field tested such a report format for the state and this study—the Show-Me MDS Quality Indicator Report (Show-Me QI report)." Special features of the Show-Me QI report include five quarterly longitudinal comparisons of MDS QIs in both table and graphic illustration for each nursing home (see  Fig. 1 ). To prepare the report, it was necessary to conduct expert panels to set thresholds to be used in the illustrations to help quality improvement teams target areas of care delivery for further investigation (Rantz, Petroski, Madsen, Scott, et al. 1997   ; Rantz et al. 2000   ). Trend lines over time are easy to see and interpret. Comparisons to expert set thresholds are more likely to point to potential clinical problems that can be masked by simple comparisons to statewide averages. A statewide average may be the result of a poor clinical practice that is accepted as the norm in the majority of nursing homes in the state. Some facilities may falsely interpret that they have good quality because they are "average," when the average practice is really indicative of poor clinical care (Rantz, Petroski, Madsen, Scott, et al. 1997   , Rantz, Petroski, Madsen, Mehr, et al. 2000   ).The Show-Me QI reports for this study contained the MDS QIs as defined in Version 6.1 of Quality Indicators for MDS 2.0 Two Page Quarterly from the Center for Health Systems Research and Analysis at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (CHSRA 1995   ).  Table 1  is a list of the MDS QIs displayed in the Show-Me QI reports that were used in the intervention in this study. Sample In Fall 1997, after the Show-Me QI report had been designed and field tested for the intervention, facilities that were transmitting MDS data electronically were recruited to participate in the clinical trial from among all nursing facilities in the state (n = 481). More than 160 volunteered, but not all were transmitting sufficient MDS data to prepare an accurate report for interpretation by a quality improvement team. It was determined that 129 facilities had adequate data to participate; of these, 16 facilities were in remote locations in the state beyond the 4-hour driving limitation for the study. Therefore, 113 facilities were randomly assigned to one of three groups for the study: 38 facilities were assigned to Group 1 (workshop and feedback reports only), 38 to Group 2 (workshop and feedback reports with clinical consultation), and 37 to Group 3 (control group with no intervention until after the study).In the two intervention groups there were 17 facilities (9 in Group 1 and 8 in Group 2) that did not attend their training workshop, so they were not able to receive their feedback reports and were excluded from all analyses. Recall that facilities at the time this study was conducted did not have access to MDS QI information without participating in the study. An additional 9 facilities were missing either baseline or follow-up data, so they could not be used in the analysis. After exclusion of these 26 facilities because of failure to attend the intervention workshop or missing data, the analysis is based on 87 facilities: 27 in Group 1, 28 in Group 2, and 32 in Group 3. The resulting groups were of sufficient size for adequate power in planned analyses for treatment effect. Although the sampling unit in this study is the nursing home, it is worth noting that the MDS QI scores of the 87 nursing homes are based on data from 6,381 residents at baseline and 7,385 residents at the one-year postintervention follow-up.The 87 nursing homes in the analysis are similar to the nursing homes in the remainder of the state except that the proportion of larger nursing homes in the study is higher than the proportion of larger homes in the remainder of the state. It is possible that larger nursing homes began transmitting data sooner than smaller ones in the state and, therefore, were able to volunteer to participate in the study.  Table 2  describes the characteristics of study homes by group assignment. Due to random assignment, nursing homes of varying size and ownership participating in the study were distributed relatively evenly among the three groups. Those excluded from analysis reflected the proportions of participating homes' size and ownership.Facilities selected for Groups 1 and 2 were invited to send a core group of employees (for example, the administrator, director of nursing, quality assurance coordinator, a staff nurse, and a nursing assistant) to one of the workshops conveniently scheduled in their area. Typically, facility staff who attended were the administrator and director of nursing; in many cases, a staff nurse responsible for MDS completion and/or quality assurance accompanied them. Facilities entered the study in two phases in 1997 and 1998 due to data transmission delays as facilities learned to enter and transmit MDS data to the state survey and certification agency. Data were analyzed for each facility at baseline and one year post-baseline corresponding to the phase of the study in which they entered. Interventions An educational program, conducted in regional workshops, was designed for staff from facilities assigned to Groups 1 and 2. The purpose was to teach staff about quality improvement and how to use their Show-Me QI report that they would receive quarterly throughout the study. Content of the workshops included information about MDS QIs, how to initiate quality improvement teams, how to interpret their Show-Me QI report, how to compare themselves to other facilities in the state, and how to implement quality improvement projects targeted at improving resident outcomes measured by the MDS QIs. The staff was encouraged to initiate quality improvement efforts specific to their facility. During the workshops, staff members were given a QI manual prepared by the research team that outlined specific concurrent monitoring plans for each MDS QI to be used in evaluating resident care, as well as a comprehensive reference list of current clinical practice standards for each (Rantz and Popejoy 1998   ). During the workshop they received a copy of their facility's first quarterly comparative feedback Show-Me QI report. The report included a resident roster that listed residents who met one or more of the definitions of the MDS QIs and could potentially have the clinical problem(s) defined by the indicator. Subsequent quarterly reports were mailed to the administrator and director of nursing in each facility in Groups 1 and 2 who participated in the assigned workshops.In addition to the educational program and quarterly comparative MDS QI feedback reports, staff from nursing homes assigned to Group 2 were offered access to telephone and/or on-site clinical consultation from a gerontological clinical nurse specialist (GCNS). Use of the GCNS was at the facility's discretion. The overall purpose of the consultation was to assist facilities to interpret their quarterly Show-Me QI report and enable them to make decisions about which clinical issues required further review. Discussions centered on issues related to MDS coding, resident assessment accuracy, and assistance in using the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) manual and other RAI reference materials. After coding and assessment issues had been addressed, the GCNS helped facilities identify the clinical problems that were resulting from potentially problematic care practices. In later consultations, assessment of resident problems using RAI resident assessment protocols (RAPs), use of clinical practice guidelines, documentation of care, and care planning were key issues that were discussed.At the educational workshop, the GCNS offered the nursing homes in Group 2 consultation on site and/or by telephone. After the workshop, the GCNS called each of the 28 nursing homes in Group 2 to ask how they were doing with report interpretations and quality improvement efforts and offered to come for a site visit. Staff from 15 of the nursing homes had one or more on-site visits, as well as telephone calls. Staff from 11 of the nursing homes used telephone consultation only, including conference calls with multiple staff members. Only two homes were not interested in further telephone calls or a site visit. After each telephone call or site visit, homes were encouraged to call the GCNS with further questions. Due to the lengthy travel distances required, phone consultations between visits were encouraged. However, homes that were interested in making practice changes generally desired more site visits. Staff from 10 of the homes in Group 2 were quite receptive to GCNS offers and used on-site consultations to work with groups of their staff several times during the study. These groups typically included the director of nursing, quality assurance coordinator, nurse responsible for MDS completion, other licensed staff, and a few nursing assistants. Staff from the other Group 2 homes (n = 18) seemed interested, but had only one or no on-site consultation and only limited telephone consultation.Group 3 facilities, the control group, received no information until the end of the study. At that time, they received the same educational program as Groups 1 and 2, the QI study manual, and began receiving their quarterly Show-Me QI report. Additionally, those who were assigned to Groups 1 and 2 who were "no shows" for the intervention workshops were invited to attend these sessions and receive materials and quarterly reports at the end of the study. Analysis Outcome measures for this study were selected from the MDS QIs that were included in the feedback report to participating facilities. Thirteen MDS QIs were selected as outcome measures because they are particularly sensitive to clinical intervention by nursing home staff and have sufficient variation in scores to detect changes, as described in a previous study (Rantz et al. 1996   ). At the facility level, the MDS QIs are calculated as the proportion of residents positive for a particular condition on a particular occasion.Summary statistics were examined for the outcome measures that included means, standard deviations, and medians (50th percentile). Some of the MDS QI scores have highly skewed (asymmetric) distributions. In such cases the sample median is a more appropriate measure of central tendency than is the sample mean. In cases where the mean and median are strikingly different, the median is generally preferred.The primary analysis employed logistic regression methods to perform the equivalent of a two-factor analysis of covariance for each MDS QI. The independent variables were Group (three levels) and Time (two levels, baseline and one year) and the interaction of Group and Time; the dependent variables were the MDS QI scores. Because MDS QI scores may be affected by resident case mix, an adjustment for case mix was included as a covariate in each analysis. The case mix variable is the facility average case mix index derived from Version 5.12 of the 44-group RUG-III algorithm using the hierarchical classification method and HCFA case mix index set B0 (Fries et al. 1994   ; Health Care Financing Administration 1998   ).Each regression model included a term for the interaction of Group and Time. In the presence of significant (p ≤ .05) interaction, further analysis is required because the main effects of Group and Time are not directly interpretable. Statistically significant interaction suggests that the intervention and control groups behaved differently over time, which is what one would expect to see with an effective intervention. Significant interactions were followed by pre–post comparisons to determine which groups changed from their baseline values. Because repeated observations (pre- and postintervention) on the same facility are not independent, the method of generalized estimating equations was used to calculate standard errors.The primary analysis assumed an intention-to-treat principle in that the analysis is based on the facilities as they were randomized to the three groups. The analysis does not incorporate any measure of the facilities' efforts to utilize the intervention resources beyond attending the training sessions. Particularly, some Group 2 homes made extensive use of the clinical consultant, but others did not draw on this resource. A secondary analysis was performed to examine a subset of Group 2 nursing homes that were intensively involved in the intervention. Using the same methods as in the primary analysis, this intensive intervention group was compared with the control group to detect changes in outcomes from baseline to one year (Group × Time effects). The intent of this secondary analysis was to examine if a more intense intervention might produce any impact on quality. Given the small sample size and the exploratory nature of this analysis, effects were considered to be "suggestive" when p ≤ .10. Significant (p ≤ .10) interactions were followed by pre–post comparisons to determine which of the groups changed from their baseline values. Line graphs of the group medians were constructed to better appreciate fluctuations over time and possible Group × Time interactions to better understand group quality performance differences. Field notes of all consultations, both on site and telephone, by the GCNS were content analyzed. The numbers of telephone and on-site consultations for each facility were tabulated; the clinical content discussed was categorized as well as the facility staff who participated in the consultation. Results Primary Analysis Summary statistics for each outcome are presented by the factors Group and Time in  Table 3  . With respect to these factors, there were only two statistically significant findings from the primary regression analyses. The main effect for Time was significant (p < .0001) in the analysis of MDS QI 6 (9 or more medications). Neither the Group effect nor the Group × Time interactions were significant for MDS QI 6, indicating that while there were changes from baseline, the changes were consistent across the three groups. Scores for MDS QI 6 increased (worsened) nearly uniformly from baseline for all three groups over the course of the study. The other statistically significant finding was in the Group × Time interaction (p = .03) for MDS QI 27 (presence of little or no activity). Pairwise comparisons revealed significant declines from baseline for both intervention groups but not for the control group.Although the results were not significant at the .05 level, summary statistics suggest an intervention effect on MDS QI 9 (prevalence of occasional or frequent bladder or bowel incontinence without a toileting plan). As can be seen in  Table 3  , there were clinically meaningful changes from baseline in both intervention groups, whereas MDS QI 9 scores were essentially unchanged in the control group. The lack of statistical significance may be due to the high degree of variability in the scores for MDS QI 9 relative to the sample size of this study. Note that in some cases the standard deviations are nearly as large as the mean or median scores. Secondary Analysis To further explore the potential for this type of intervention, a secondary analysis was performed in which a subset of the Group 2 nursing homes that were intensely involved with the intervention (n = 10; 35% of Group 2 nursing homes) were compared to Group 3 (control). These nursing homes utilized on-site and telephone clinical consultation from the GCNS more extensively, that is, more than twice on site and more than twice with telephone consultation. Demographics of ownership and bed size of this subset of Group 2 were reflective of Group 2 and the other study groups; six were 61–120 and four were 120+ bed-size; two were governmental, two were nonprofit, and six were for-profit nursing homes. Table 3  displays the summary statistics of the workshop and intensive consultation group (n = 10). Regression results for the secondary analysis are presented in  Table 4  . Using the p ≤ .10 criterion, the Group × Time interaction was significant in the analysis of the following MDS QIs: MDS QI 2 (falls), MDS QI 3 (behavioral symptoms), MDS QI 27 (little or no activity), MDS QI 29 (pressure ulcers), and MDS QI 29 low risk (pressure ulcers in low-risk residents). For each of these five outcomes, pairwise comparisons revealed that MDS QI scores declined (improved) from pre- to postintervention in the intensive consultation group and remained unchanged in the control group.Other statistically significant (p ≤ .10) results include a significant main effect for Time in the analysis of MDS QI 6 (9 or more medications) with nearly uniform increases from baseline in both groups. A similar result was seen in the primary analysis.The analysis for MDS QI 9 (incontinence without a toileting plan) resulted in a highly significant (p = .007) Group effect and a marginally significant (p = .08) Time effect. On this outcome the control and intensive intervention groups were not comparable on their baseline measurements. The baseline median MDS QI score for the control group was 63.3 versus 39.7 for the intensive intervention group. Due to the small sample size the interaction term is not significant (p = .13); however, summary statistics suggest that the intervention group improved from baseline (39.7 vs 23.0) and that the control group's scores were essentially constant (63.3 vs 62.5).Finally, on MDS QI 26 (physical restraints), there was a significant (p = .06) Group effect. On this MDS QI the control and intervention groups were slightly different from each other at baseline and postintervention, but neither group showed significant changes from their baseline values.To understand these differences in MDS QIs with suggestive Group × Time interaction results, the median scores for each quarter in the study were used to construct line graphs for Group 1 (workshop only and feedback reports; n = 27), Group 2 intensive consultation (workshop, feedback reports, and intensive on-site GCNS consultation; n = 10), Group 2 limited consultation (workshop, feedback reports, and limited on-site GCNS consultation; n = 18), and control homes (n = 32).Line graphs in  Fig. 2  and  Fig. 3  visually reveal trends in improvement in the intensive consultation subgroup of Group 2 that sought the consultation of the GCNS for MDS QI 2 (falls) and MDS QI 29 (pressure ulcers). Field Note Analysis Field notes kept by the GCNS of all contacts with the nursing homes assigned to Group 2 were analyzed to understand the content of the consultations. Those nursing homes that sought the consultation support most often used quality assurance teams that were already in place in their facilities to review their Show-Me QI report. All MDS QIs and the MDS definitions were discussed in depth. After they understood the MDS QIs and definitions, they selected indicators for further examination in their facility. Most facilities used a combination of their knowledge of problem areas in their nursing home and high MDS QI scores (indicating a potential problem) to make a decision about which care delivery process to begin examining. Often facilities would have to correct MDS assessment and coding problems and then reevaluate an indicator to determine if it was an actual problem or an MDS coding problem.In subsequent site or telephone consultation visits, MDS QI scores were discussed and resident care was explored in depth. When appropriate, specific interventions to try with residents were discussed. Facilities were encouraged to address clinical practice systematically, using the quality monitoring plans provided in the study manual.Analysis of field notes revealed that staff from most of the 10 nursing homes decided to focus on resident falls and pressure ulcers as their first projects. The GCNS provided the latest clinical information about these topics. All homes were encouraged to use RAIs such as the Risk Assessment for Falls Scale II (RAFS II) (Maas 1991   ) and the Braden Scale for pressure ulcer risk assessment (Baharestani 1999   ; Bergstrom, Braden, Boynton, and Brunch 1995   ; Panel on the Prediction and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers in Adults 1992   ). Facilities were told how to order and were encouraged to use clinical practice guidelines prepared by the American Medical Directors Association on the topic of falls and urinary incontinence (Falls and Fall Risk Panel 1998   ; Urinary Incontinence Panel 1996   ) and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for pressure ulcers and incontinence (Panel on the Prediction and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers in Adults 1992   ; Urinary Incontinence Guidelines Panel 1992   ). Facilities were also encouraged to put in place documentation systems for those problems that would allow the clinical staff to identify readily patterns in falls and changes in clinical conditions increasing residents' risk for the development of pressure ulcers.Analysis of field notes for the 18 nursing homes in Group 2 who decided not to use the consultation of the GCNS revealed a variety of reasons stated for the refusal of a site visit, but short staffing, staff turnover, or other pressing issues were frequently cited. Generally, staff would say they had received their Show-Me QI report, that they were taking care of things themselves, and that they really had no questions or need for the site visit. Discussion Using a three-group randomized design, with the exception of MDS QI 27 (little or no activity), we found no significant differences between the groups assigned to two quality improvement interventions, one with quality improvement information and MDS QI comparative performance reports, one with the same information and reports with additional consultation support of a GCNS, or the control group. However, upon closer examination, outcomes of residents in nursing homes that actually took advantage of the clinical consultation of the GCNS demonstrated trends in improvements in QIs measuring falls, behavioral symptoms, little or no activity, and pressure ulcers (overall and for low-risk residents). It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly. By separating those nursing homes that were assigned to the additional consultation group but did not use the consultation extensively, we were able to detect some improvement changes in outcome measures.When the study was designed, participation was viewed as voluntary. However, inquiries about the consultation seemed to indicate that facilities assigned to Groups 1 and 3 were disappointed that they did not have access to consultation support of the GCNS. Therefore, it was surprising to us that more than half of the nursing homes assigned to Group 2 did not take full advantage of the free consultation offered during telephone follow-up. Reluctance to participate may have been a function of competing priorities for nursing home staff who are busy with moment-to-moment issues of care delivery. Stopping to evaluate clinical practices and design improvements may seem overwhelming or simply not a priority for some. Perhaps the number of homes accepting support would have been higher had the intervention been designed in such a way as to obtain agreement from participants that, if assigned to the clinical consultation group, they would agree to at least quarterly site visits by the GCNS. Our approach of telephone contact and offers for on-site support seemed to be strong enough to involve about a third of the nursing homes in Group 2 intensively. Something stronger is needed to encourage the remaining two thirds.The significant improvement in MDS QI 27 (little or no activity) for both intervention Groups 1 and 2 is likely due to heightened awareness about accurately coding the MDS items used in this indicator. The importance of accurate coding of the MDS items was reinforced in the workshops and teaching materials for the intervention groups. Alternatively, it is possible that more activities were planned and carried out for residents, and that coding changes reflect the increase in activity.Travel distance is an issue for on-site consultation. For consultation to be effective, travel distances must be reasonable so that the consulting staff can make appointments, travel to the nursing homes, and have adequate time for discussion with staff and on-site observation assistance with clinical problems. If at all possible, consulting staff located within regions of a state would be beneficial to a study such as this. Some appointments were frustrating because situations would occur that prevented the scheduled site visit at the last moment, after the consultant had traveled 2 or more hours to meet with staff. Finding consultation staff close to the area would reduce travel time and provide more options for scheduling site visits.The changes in fall and pressure ulcers scores for the nursing homes that used intensive consultation is most likely related to several things. There are clear standards of practice on both of these issues. Both problems are sensitive to interventions at the resident level. For example, often simple discussions with the GCNS about different approaches enabled facilities to make changes in interventions on plans of care that reduced fall rates. The GCNS encouraged all nursing homes to use RAIs for falls and for pressure ulcer development. Facilities were encouraged to use clinical practice guidelines about fall and pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. Staff could grasp the clinical changes needed for better management of these clinical problems.The increase in scores for all groups for MDS QI 6 (9 or more medications) has some possible clinical explanations. This MDS QI was discussed in facilities where it was high (indicating a problem). The increase over time may indicate an increase in resident acuity. It may also be a reflection of changes in practice guidelines that have occurred in the last 2 years that now recommend multidrug regimens for some conditions. For example, managing severe congestive heart failure often routinely now includes several medications (Bottorff 2001   ; Feldman 2001   ). Apparently, some broad practice changes or increases in acuity are affecting nursing homes across the state and were detected across all groups in the study.The overall message of this study is clear: To effect improvement in resident outcomes, simply providing comparative performance feedback is not enough. There may be some exceptional nursing homes that can independently put a team together to examine and interpret comparative performance feedback reports such as the one used in this study or the one now available for every nursing home in the country from the federal MDS data system. There may be some exceptional places with teams that can plan quality improvement data collection, interpret results, and plan actions to improve their clinical practices. However, the results suggest that active clinical consultation support in the context of a ready environment is needed to help staff in most nursing homes conduct quality improvement activities that will effect improvement in resident outcomes. This is consistent with the findings of two recent comprehensive research reviews that found that performance can be affected to a small or moderate degree with feedback, whereas other interventions to increase the effectiveness of feedback have yet to be adequately tested (Thomson O'Brien et al. 2000a   ; Thomson O'Brien et al. 2000b   ). Similarly, Solberg, Brekke, Fazio, and colleagues (2000) concluded that multiple strategies are needed to successfully change health care provider practice patterns and influence them to incorporate clinical guidelines. Although these and other studies are not nursing home-based, it appears that enhancing feedback interventions with additional strategies may improve effectiveness and actually facilitate a positive change in clinical practice by health care providers.It also appears that while we can generate a myriad of quality indicator information for teams to examine, they can only focus on one or two areas for improvement at a time. For those who are experienced in quality improvement, this will come as no surprise. There is a limit to the time and energy of staff that can be harnessed to implement and sustain change. Selecting a limited number of topics for further examination, collecting data about current care practices, interpreting the data collected, planning actions, educating staff about necessary changes, and following up to see that the changes in practice actually happened as planned, takes time. The problems of staff turnover and too few staff to participate in a quality improvement team also interfere with the number of areas that can be addressed, changed, and sustained as an accepted clinical practice.Nursing homes participated in the study for a full year (four quarters of feedback reports) with the quarter before the study as baseline. We anticipated that staff from participating facilities would need the first quarter to select topics and begin their data collection to examine problem areas further. Action plans could be implemented in the next quarter. Because residents are assessed every quarter using the MDS instrument, we anticipated that changes in their outcomes could be detected in the reassessment processes during the third and fourth quarters. This timeline appears to have worked for those nursing homes that did embrace the quality improvement process. For the others in the study, perhaps a longer period of time is needed for staff to implement changes in practice and to detect changes in resident outcomes in quarterly assessments.This view is supported by the fact that correcting inaccurate MDS assessments takes time. When staff in nursing homes first came together to examine their Show-Me QI report, much time was devoted to explaining the definitions of the MDS QIs and clarifying MDS coding. Because most nursing homes hire a nurse RAI coordinator to be responsible for timely and accurate completion of the MDS, turnover in this position is devastating to the accuracy of MDS coding. Many teams in the nursing homes participating in the study were confronted with staff turnover in this key position that compounded their efforts to correct coding errors so that they could more accurately evaluate MDS QI scores. Because residents are reassessed with a version of the MDS every quarter, it takes one quarter to see the changes of the reassessment in the next MDS QI report. It was not unusual for some teams to work for two or three quarters to correct coding errors, especially if there was staff turnover or the interdisciplinary care planning team was not functioning well. Some teams seemed to never get as far as we had hoped they would into the quality improvement process that focused on clinical care delivery changes. They seemed to be mired in the MDS assessment process and coding issues.Most of the participating nursing facilities did not have well-developed quality improvement programs with systems to support implementing changes needed in care delivery. While staff seem to be able to alter care for short periods of time for some residents, there seems to be little systematic change that would broadly improve quality of care throughout the facility. It is difficult to convince staff to use continuous quality improvement principles. Most nursing homes do not use specific teams to address problems, nor do they report accomplishments. Many facilities continue to only use the quality assurance measures found in the OBRA regulations. In others, there is a crisis management approach, and problems are not addressed until they are so severe that they cannot be ignored. These findings may be related to the small numbers of professional staff who work in nursing homes. There may simply not be enough professional staff to have the critical mass needed to commit time and energy to quality improvement methods. Alternatively, it may be a function of leadership not embracing quality improvement as a way to improve care and services to residents. Nursing homes that did have continuous quality improvement systems in place were often part of larger health care systems that have ongoing support from a quality improvement expert. We noticed that large and complex facilities also are more likely to have well-organized quality improvement processes. Those homes are structured in such a way that there are multiple nurses responsible for the RAI process, as well as a quality manager on staff to support care delivery improvements.While it would seem that simply educating staff about quality improvement and how to implement quality improvement programs should improve resident outcomes, it is probably much more complex. Findings from a recent quality improvement study in primary care clinics found no effect from quality improvement training, consultation, and networking to help the teams of staff develop and implement prevention services (Solberg, Kottke, Brekke, et al. 2000   ). Similarly, Goldberg and colleagues 1998    found in a randomized clinical trial that quality improvement teams were generally ineffective in improving guideline compliance and primary care clinical outcomes of hypertension and depression. Quality improvement strategies that actually affect resident outcomes in a positive way apparently involve more than education about quality improvement methods. It is likely that the context of care—with its myriad factors such as leadership, performance expectations, organizational culture, staff mix, and others—will impact the success (or failure) of quality improvement efforts. Clinical consultation with a GCNS does appear to be effective and capable of improving resident outcomes. Our results of improved resident outcomes in the nursing homes that sought additional support from the GCNS are strikingly similar to Ryden and colleagues 2000   . In that study, weekly consultation of 10 hours of a GCNS did significantly improve outcomes of pressure ulcer development, incontinence, and aggressive behavior. Although more evaluation of effectiveness is clearly needed, it appears that ongoing GCNS consultation may be an important strategy to influence and improve clinical care and subsequently improve resident outcomes in nursing homes.Limitations of this study are that we conducted it in a single state, so regional variations were not addressed. When we implemented the intervention we did not provide feedback reports to the nursing homes that failed to attend the required workshops. Therefore, those facilities were excluded from the analysis, so we could not use them in a complete intention to treat analysis that some may favor in a field study such as this. The subgroup analysis needs careful interpretation because the subgroup that used intensive consultation was a self-selected group. However, the results suggest that more intensive interventions may be effective to impact resident outcomes. Using feedback to support quality improvement is a complex intervention that may require substantially more effort. Further research is needed to explore the amount of consultation support as well as the organizational context of care that is necessary for a quality improvement feedback intervention to positively affect resident outcomes. Another potential limitation of this study is that our outcome measures rely on the accuracy of MDS data. Although reliabilities of MDS data are reported as good, particularly for those areas used as outcomes in this study (Casten, Lawton, Parmelee, and Kleban 1998   ; Hawes et al. 1995   ; Morris et al. 1997   ; Phillips, Chu, Morris, and Hawes 1993   ), one must always be concerned about data accuracy when using data collected for clinical research purposes.Change in any organization is difficult. Nursing homes are no exception. Researchers working with nursing home staff to improve resident continence have repeatedly found that it is extremely difficult to maintain toileting programs, even those that are well designed and found to be effective (Ouslander et al. 1995   ; Schnelle, Newman, White et al. 1993   ; Schnelle, Ouslander, Osterweil et al. 1993   ; Specht, Bergquist, and Frantz 1995   ). Follow-through on recommendations for fall reduction has met with the same difficulty (Ray et al. 1997   ). Follow-through to implement and sustain change is necessary for quality improvement. In nursing homes where there is clear administrative support and expectation that care innovations be planned and effectively implemented, changes in practice occur (Levine, Marchello, and Totolos 1995   ; Rantz and Miller 1989   ; Specht et al. 1995   ; Specht and Lyons in press   ). If we are to implement true quality improvement programs in nursing homes throughout the country, there must be commitment from leadership within each facility that quality improvement is important and encouragement for staff to participate in quality improvement activities.For states designing statewide strategies to encourage quality improvement in nursing homes using MDS QIs, the message is clear. Nursing facilities need more than feedback reports to improve resident outcomes. Clinical expertise is essential. Quality improvement and team development expertise is essential as is administrative support and commitment to excellence in clinical practice. Somehow, these ingredients must come together for clinical practice changes to be implemented and sustained that will improve resident outcomes. Clinical consultation provided by an advanced practice gerontological nurse appears to be an effective strategy that can be used, given administrative encouragement to use the consultation.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study explored how nursing home residents define quality of care. Design and Methods: Data were collected through in-depth interviews and were analyzed using grounded dimensional analysis. Results: Residents defined quality in three ways: (a) Care-as-service residents focused on instrumental aspects of care. They assessed quality using the parameters of efficiency, competence, and value. (b) Care-as-relating residents emphasized the affective aspects of care, defining quality as care that demonstrated friendship and allowed them to show reciprocity with their caregivers. (c) Care-as-comfort residents defined quality as care that allowed them to maintain their physical comfort, a state that required minute and often repetitive adjustments in response to their bodily cues. Implications: Residents' perceptions of care quality have implications for long-term care practice. The integration of these perceptions into quality assurance instruments could improve the usefulness of tools designed to obtain resident input.   Nursing homes ,  Long-term care facilities ,  Quality of care ,  Consumer quality assessment Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDThe work of quality assurance (QA) has been described as encompassing three distinct tasks: defining quality, assessing quality, and assuring quality (Kane and Kane 1988   ). Since the 1980s, health services researchers and policy makers have grown increasingly interested in incorporating the point of view of health care consumers into QA procedures (Davies and Ware 1988   ). In the long-term care (LTC) arena, consumer perspectives have been used both to define the dimensions of quality (Grant, Reimer, and Bannatyne 1996   ; Grau, Chandler, and Saunders 1995   ; National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, 1985; Nores 1997   ) and to prioritize the dimensions of quality that have been proposed by experts (Bliesmer and Earle 1993   ; Mattiasson and Andersson 1997   ; Pearson, Hocking, Mott, and Riggs 1993   ). The trend toward involving consumers in LTC QA has been codified in legislation: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 includes the requirement that quality measurements incorporate assessments of resident satisfaction.In some conceptualizations of quality in health care, consumers can play a central role in assessing and defining quality. The approach known as "patient-centered" care uses patients' assessments of their quality of life to indicate the presence of high-quality care (Aller and Coeling 1995   ; Gerteis, Edgman-Levitan, Daley, and Delbanco 1993   ; Lutz and Bowers 2000   ; Mattiasson and Andersson 1997   ; Miller 1997   ; Pearson et al. 1993   ). A second approach views autonomy—manifested in active participation—as key to quality (Ashworth, Longmate, and Morrison 1992   ; Jirovec and Maxwell 1993   ; Kane et al. 1997   ; Mitchell and Koch 1997   ; Wetle, Levkoff, Cwikel, and Rosen 1988   ). Here, individuals' perceptions of choice are used as one indicator of quality (Brocklehurst and Dickinson 1996   ; Brooke and Short 1996   ). A third approach conceptualizes quality care as care that meets the expectations of those who purchase it (Lengnick-Hall and Barton 1995   ; Owens and Batchelor 1996   ). Thus, quality is to be assessed through instruments that measure consumer satisfaction (Cleary and McNeil 1988   ; Davis, Sebastian, and Tschetter 1997   ; Jackson and Kroenke 1997   ; Laitinen 1994   ; Ludwig-Beymer et al. 1993   ; Pearson et al. 1993   ). A fourth approach uses ethnography to examine the experience—good or bad—of being a patient in the health care system or a resident in institutions devoted to restoring health or managing illness (Clark and Bowling 1990   ; Goffman 1961   ; Gubrium 1975   ; Kane et al. 1997   ).Although consumer perspectives are rarely the central determinant in overall assessments of quality, their use has provoked controversy. There is debate about how these views can best be gathered and used (Cleary and Edgman-Levitan 1997   ; Lehr and Strosberg 1991   ; Peters 1993   ). Critics have argued that consumers cannot be competent judges of the technical elements of health care quality (Donabedian 1980   ), seeing consumer quality assessments as more indicative of consumer characteristics and affective responses to interpersonal experiences than the actual quality of the service received (Grau et al. 1995   ; Larsson and Larsson 1999   ). Defenders of the use of consumer quality assessment, however, citing studies that show good agreement between consumer assessments and a "gold standard" of expert assessment, assert that consumers are able to make competent judgments about the technical components of care (Davies and Ware 1988   ). In addition, they argue that interpersonal experience constitutes an important dimension of quality, one that consumers are, in fact, uniquely qualified to assess (Carson, Carson, and Roe 1998   ).The characteristics of individuals who use LTC services have been seen as particularly problematic for including them in QA activities. Researchers have warned, for example, about threats to validity posed by factors like dementia, fatalistic resignation, low expectations, and fear of retaliation after unfavorable assessments (Aller and Coeling 1995   ; Bliesmer and Earle 1993   ; Grau et al. 1995   ; Laitinen 1994   ; Pearson et al. 1993   ).Despite these difficulties, several studies have sought to solicit the definitions of quality held by the residents of nursing homes. The most comprehensive—and the earliest—of these studies, a nationwide project conducted by the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform (1985), identified many of the dimensions of daily life in LTC facilities that were key to residents' ideas about quality of care. Overall, participants in this study defined quality care as having "choices and the ability to make them" (p. 15) in a happy, safe environment, being treated as individuals, and allowed to be independent. Later studies have emphasized the importance of social relationships in residents' perceptions of quality care (Grant et al. 1996   ; Grau et al. 1995   ; Mattiasson and Andersson 1997   ).The current research was designed to expand upon earlier work by looking at quality of care in an LTC facility from the point of view of the residents. As this report will show, residents' definitions of quality centered on the intricacies of their relationships with their care providers, and on the consequences of care for physical comfort and sense of self. Methods This research was part of a larger study that examined care and caregiving practices in several LTC facilities from multiple perspectives. The portion of the study reported here focused on how nursing home residents conceptualize the quality of their care. The researchers used in-depth interviews and grounded dimensional analysis (Caron and Bowers 2000   ; Glaser and Strauss 1967   ; Schatzman 1991   ; Strauss 1987   ) to collect and analyze the data.Data were collected at three LTC facilities in and around Madison, Wisconsin. The facilities served a range of income levels and had minimal deficiencies as indicated by state survey results. In order to facilitate comparison to the wider market, these facilities were purposely selected to reflect different owner types, payment sources, and resident income levels. (For more information about the facilities, see  Table 1  .)Following approval by the human subjects committee, residents were recruited into the study by facility nurses who provided no direct patient care. (Institutional Review Board approval was contingent upon using a familiar staff person who was not a direct care provider to do the recruitment.) Researchers asked the nurses to invite participation from all residents who could understand what was being asked of them. The only residents nurses were instructed not to invite were those who were too ill or too cognitively impaired to participate in an interview. The nurses gave each resident a brief oral description of the research. Residents who were interested in participating completed a form indicating their name, room number, and a convenient time to contact them. The first nine residents in each facility to express an interest in participation were included in the research. (See  Table 2  for more information about the residents.)Early in the recruitment process, discussions between researchers and facility nurses revealed that the nurses were not recruiting residents they saw as "unrealistic" or "inappropriate" in their expectations. Further questioning revealed that these residents tended to be the ones who were known to staff as "complainers" or as "difficult." Sensing that the perspective of complainers might provide interesting data about quality, the researchers asked nurses to include residents with this reputation in the study, but not to reveal which residents were complainers until after all interviews were completed.Interviews with residents took place in the residents' rooms with only the resident and the interviewer present. Depending on the resident's stamina, interviews lasted between 15 minutes and 2 hours. Most interviews lasted about 45 minutes. Residents were initially asked only to "talk about what it's like to live here." The purpose of this request was to have residents identify for the researcher those elements of their daily lives that they themselves found most relevant. Residents rarely needed further prompting or encouragement to talk.Resident responses to these general questions often resulted in an initial evaluative response such as "It's not so bad"; "It's hell"; "It's OK." Residents were then prompted to elaborate on these responses. In particular, they were asked to give examples of experiences they had had in the nursing home, to describe what they found either "good" or "bad" about these experiences, and to specify how they had come to these conclusions. Analysis of their responses to these probing questions sought to delineate the dimensions of both "good" and "bad" care as conceptualized by the residents. As the study progressed, second interviews were guided by emerging analysis to further elucidate the dimensions of the participants' experiences and perceptions of quality. All but one resident, who was discharged, were interviewed twice. The interval between interviews ranged from 7 to 10 days.Interview data were analyzed using grounded dimensional analysis, an approach derived from grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967   ; Strauss 1987   ) and dimensional analysis (Caron and Bowers 2000   ; Schatzman 1991   ). Grounded dimensional analysis combines the key elements of grounded theory, including theoretical sampling and constant comparison, with the analytic framework provided by dimensional analysis. This framework explicates the phenomenon of interest (care quality) by prompting the analyst to conduct a rigorous examination of the perspective from which the phenomenon is presented by the subjects, the context within which the phenomenon is described, the dimensions of the phenomenon, the conditions under which the phenomenon varies, and the consequences of the phenomenon.In this study, analysis focused on how residents described the phenomenon of care, including identification of the dimensions of care or daily life that were used by residents when describing good or bad care. Comparative analyses across interviews suggested the three distinct types of resident quality definitions described in this article. Within each interview, there was a high level of consistency in the dimensions used to define quality. Further analysis of how these three types of definitions clustered by resident condition suggested that the definition of quality varied with level of functional impairment. Other variation in resident definitions of quality cannot be attributed easily to resident status. This variation and some of the implications are discussed below. Results Residents' descriptions of quality fell into three categories. These categories tended to cluster by the resident's level of dependency and by his or her reputation among nurses as "difficult." (The significance of these resident characteristics for their definitions of quality was identified during analysis; the researchers did not use functional status and reputation as a complainer as a priori categories in the design or execution of the study.) Among the more independent group of participants, residents identified by staff as complainers tended to see care-as-service, whereas residents identified as ranging from "more reasonable" to "real sweeties" usually described care-as-relating. The very dependent group of residents, however, some of whom were also identified by staff as complainers or manipulators, defined care-as-comfort. Care-as-Service There were four participants who described care-as-service. Two resided in Facility 2 and two in Facility 3—the homes that served a middle and upper income clientele. These residents used the term "service" to refer to the staff work—passing food trays, making beds, assisting with bathing and personal care—that providers and researchers generally label care or caregiving. Residents who used the language of service focused on technical/instrumental aspects of care, including how well, how quickly, and how consistently the work was done. These residents perceived themselves as the purchasers of services and tended to compare their experiences in the LTC facilities with other instances in which they had paid people to provide them with specific services (e.g., appliance repair people or restaurant wait staff).These residents suggested that they had the "rights" accruing to any consumer. For example, they believed that they should have the authority to instruct staff in how or when something should be done and that they were entitled to pass judgment on the adequacy of the services received:When I'm paying so much I should have more to say. I'm paying good money to stay here, I should have better service. I pay $3000 a month and I can't even get a glass of water when I want it.Residents who conceptualized care as a purchased service made their own expectations important criteria for evaluating the quality of the care they were provided. As with other purchased services, their expectations for care had to do with value and work performed. These residents evaluated their care by how well the work was done, whether or not the outcome was of high quality, and whether the work was performed in a timely manner. They viewed themselves as active participants in evaluation, not simply the passive recipients of others' judgments of adequacy. They were often highly critical of the failure of their care providers to live up to their expectations, and frustrated by their inability to perform formal evaluations of the staff. As one resident stated, "It isn't right but they just do it the way they want. I have nothing to say about it." Another resident used even stronger language:It's like robbery…you pay a fortune for a good place, thinking the service will be pretty good. Nobody has any pride in their work anymore. They just take your money and then you don't get the service you expect.Residents who viewed care-as-service were likely to identify having to wait as particularly emblematic of poor quality service. When forced to wait, these residents made comments like: "I don't know why they don't train them better…[they] can't even figure out the simplest things"; and "[they] have no understanding of what sick people really need"; or "[they are] so unorganized, I mean, [they] use 100 steps to do something that would take someone with more common sense only 10."Other residents perceived waiting as a demonstration of an implicit social hierarchy, and aides' wish to keep them at the bottom. These residents saw waiting as part of a power struggle, attributing specific motives to the care providers who made them wait: "It's not that they're so busy…you know…sometimes they're just standing around…they want to make sure we know our place…[and] know who's in charge"; or "They do it on purpose, you know…[making us wait] gives them a feeling of power."Some residents who grew impatient with waiting described taking matters into their own hands, at times placing themselves in some physical jeopardy. In an effort to call attention to the unresponsiveness of some care providers, they were likely to make their actions, and the risks they had taken, widely known to the supervisory staff. According to these residents, this kind of "complaining" angered their care providers, but was effective in prompting at least a temporary increase in staff responsiveness. Care-as-Relating Sixteen participants—six in Facility 1, three in Facility 2, and seven in Facility 3—defined care-as-relating. When asked about care quality, these residents spoke about their relationships with staff. They emphasized the degree of closeness they experienced in these relationships, rarely mentioning actual caregiving activities or tasks. When pressed to speak specifically about the care they received, care-as-relating residents talked almost exclusively about the affect of their caregivers, their caregivers' motivation, and the evidence of real friendship that they found in their relationships.Good care was described as care that was given by someone who "really likes her work…really cares about the people here." Care-as-relating residents spoke less about the technical aspects of care (the how and when described by care-as-service residents), but more about the signs of individualized affection and friendship they found in the care they received. Even under direct questioning about the technical aspects of care, these residents refused to acknowledge that it had any importance to them, insisting that factors such as competence were irrelevant. For example, residents were consistently willing to overlook care that might lead to poor outcomes if the caregiver's intent was consistent with a caring relationship. The woman quoted here, for example, excused an aide's failure to assist her with her daily exercises, including ambulation:It's OK…you know…really…It doesn't matter so much…I'll get along…She's so sweet and tries so hard…and I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings.Care-as-relating residents identified aides' willingness to share information about their personal lives, especially personal troubles, as an example of high-quality care. One resident described a favored aide: "She's really sweet, a good listener. She tells me about problems with her husband…and I give her advice." As suggested by this quotation, care-as-relating residents saw reciprocity as evidence of good relationships, and thus of good quality care. Residents often discussed reciprocity in terms of sharing invisible or past personal identities. An aide would share with the resident previously unknown personal details related to her life outside of work; in turn, the resident could share personal identities from his or her past. "Good" aides were described as attending to these identities as they provided care. By so doing, these aides were acknowledging resident selves other than those related to old age, illness, and disability. As one resident noted, a good aide was one who could "see me as not just an old lady or someone with bad knees and a catheter to clean."By contrast, "bad" care was described as care that was given by someone who had "a bad attitude," who "obviously doesn't like her job," who "never smiles or looks me in the eye," who "doesn't keep promises," who "treats me like I'm invisible or stupid," or who "never just chats, you know…[is] just all business." Bad care was conceptualized by care-as-relating residents as care given by a provider who seemed to strive to minimize or eliminate the interactive dimensions of care and whose motivation was mercenary, rather than affective (i.e., aides who were "just in it for the money," rather than out of a desire to help people).Although residents who described care-as-relating were as likely as those who described care-as-service to experience waiting, the meaning they attributed to waiting and their response to waiting provide a sharp contrast to care-as-service residents. They did not see having to wait as demonstrating poor quality care. Rather, care-as-relating residents tended to excuse long waits in ways that suggested they were determined to absolve their caregivers of any responsibility for making them wait. Their comments about having to wait included: "[it's] no one's fault, really…just too much work to do" or "the girls work so hard, you know…[they're] so overworked and short-staffed…they get there as quick as they can."Like care-as-service residents, care-as-relating residents sometimes described reacting to waiting by taking matters into their own hands. What they intended by doing so, however, was quite different. These residents saw taking action as an opportunity for them to demonstrate reciprocity. They described doing things for themselves in order to "save the girls time." As one woman said, "They do so much and work so hard. I try to find little ways to take some of the burden off." Some accounts suggested that these acts of reciprocity could endanger the resident. For example, a resident might mention to an aide that she had climbed over her bed rails so that she would not have to "bother" the aide with a request for her to lower them. Residents continued to take such risks, even when the intended recipient had objected: "She always scolds me but I know she really appreciates it. It's our secret." In keeping the action a "secret" between resident and caregiver, care-as-relating residents were demonstrating that they saw their actions as a means to strengthen interpersonal relationships, and not as ways to manipulate staff into providing better service.Being able to reciprocate in this way was viewed as rewarding, particularly for residents who saw themselves as kind and helpful and unlikely to make "unreasonable" demands or to expect to be "waited on" by others. The following comment was typical: "I've always prided myself in helping out where I can. I'm the sort of person who doesn't ask unless I really have to." "Helping out" allowed residents to assert a treasured self: that of the uncomplaining, thoughtful friend. Care-as-Comfort Frailer, more dependent residents tended to describe quality as care that was directed at maintaining their physical comfort. Six participants—three each at Facilities 1 and 2 (the low and moderate income facilities)—defined care-as-comfort. Unlike the less frail residents who focused on care-as-service and care-as-relating, these residents expressed tremendous concern about the specific hands-on care provided by aides. Although this group, like the care-as-relating residents, also mentioned the importance of having good relationships with staff, they viewed good relationships primarily as the means to ensure that they would receive timely assistance from aides.The assistance that these residents found to be the most important was related to physical comfort, rather than to medical treatment, safety, or the routine mandated tasks that aides do for residents (i.e., bed making, bathing, cleaning the rooms). Residents' accounts of good quality care were frequently focused on having something "just right." Maintaining a sense of "just right" required attending to very small, often invisible, increments of bodily changes that were generally not appreciated by staff. For example, these residents described how propping up an aching leg in just the right position could make a huge difference between comfort and "terrible" discomfort. Similarly, the difference between a refreshing drink of water and one that was offensive was, literally, a matter of degree. The discrepancy between the apparent magnitude of these differences as perceived by staff and the significance for the residents was huge.Residents who sensed the staff's resentment grew frustrated and angry, both with the staff and with themselves:I tell them I have to go to the bathroom and I can't wait and they still don't come. It's cruel to make someone wait when they know it'll mean an accident. Sometimes I can't go and they get so disgusted, and even if they don't, I feel bad. I'm taking up their time.As suggested by this quotation, loss of the ability to read body cues (a loss related to age and, often, the side effects of numerous medications and treatments) exacerbated the repetitive and sometimes unproductive nature of the tasks that residents required for their personal comfort. Staff did come to resent repeated requests to do these tasks, and often began to contest residents' attempts to read their own body cues: "No, you don't have to go to the bathroom, we just took you and you didn't have to go, remember?" or "You couldn't possibly be cold, it's 82 degrees in here."The uncertainty attached to reading body cues created a dilemma for residents: to ask for assistance or not to ask? The consequences of making the wrong decision, in either direction, were significant. Residents who suspected that they had to urinate, but weren't sure, for example, ran the risk either of wetting the bed, an event that created further discomfort, humiliation, resentment, and, eventually, more work for the staff, or of antagonizing their caregivers by asking for help with what might turn out to be an "unnecessary" trip to the toilet. Because they wished to minimize unnecessary work and didn't want to gain reputations for "crying wolf," residents often selected "waiting until I can't stand it" as the most reasonable, albeit agonizing, option. Discussion The three conceptualizations of quality described by the nursing home residents who participated in this study show some areas of overlap with those specified in the definitions of quality proffered by experts. The care-as-service residents, for example, fit well into the consumerist model of those who seek to assess quality by measuring consumer satisfaction. The wide range in resident-derived definitions of quality, however points out the inadequacy of relying upon one conceptualization of quality for QA procedures. For example, consumer satisfaction surveys that focus on the technical aspects of care might be rejected by care-as-relating residents because these residents view themselves as friends, not consumers, and would see criticizing their caregivers as disloyal. Instruments to measure choice would be perceived as ironic, at the least, and even as cruel by the care-as-comfort residents for whom "autonomy" means choosing to suffer rather than antagonize their caregivers. Care-as-service residents would likely reject the idea that facilities have any right to determine the dimensions that compose their "quality of life," but would see such attempts as presumptuous, not the place of those whose purpose is to serve. However, this group may well be the most credible source of consumer satisfaction assessment because they are willing to provide negative judgments.The significance of these findings lies primarily in their implications for the measurement of care quality and for how knowledge about quality can be applied to practice. First, the current emphasis on expert-defined clinical aspects of care, such as those encompassed by the Minimum Data Set quality indicators (MDS/QI), does not acknowledge the complexity of quality as it is experienced by nursing home residents. From the point of view of most residents, focusing regulation and practice efforts solely on improving or maintaining these clinical dimensions may not result in adequate quality of care as they themselves define it. The findings reported here provide support for the current Health Care Financing Administration-funded efforts to develop an MDS specifically directed at resident quality of life. For example, care-as-relating would fit more easily into quality of life than it does into the domains that measure quality of care. Care-as-service and care-as-comfort, however, cannot be neatly placed into either category. In particular, comfort, as described by the residents who participated in this research, is not captured by either quality of care or quality of life. The closest category currently found in the MDS is pain. This category is, however, practically and conceptually different from what residents described. Addition of a new "comfort domain" might improve the ability of the MDS to assess quality in a way that is meaningful to residents.These findings also have important implications for two areas of practice: determining the staffing needs required to deliver quality care and improving clinical practice. Currently there are no federally mandated staffing rules for nursing homes except the requirement that staffing be adequate to ensure high-quality care. The staffing levels necessary to provide such care, however, are highly contested (Bowers, Esmond, and Jacobson 2000   ). Most attempts to determine "adequate" staffing levels base their assessments on associations between staffing and results on the MDS/QI. As this study has suggested, these expert-defined clinical dimensions may not capture what constitutes quality for nursing home residents. As applied to clinical practice, these findings have significant implications for resident needs assessment, care planning, in-service education, and staff supervision. An understanding of the resident definitions described in this article would improve practitioners' ability to plan and deliver individualized care and to evaluate the quality of care provided in ways that are meaningful to residents.The limitations of the work reported here are largely inherent to the exploratory nature of the study and to the interpretive methodology used. The small sample size allowed greater analytic richness but was inadequate to ensure external validity. The study was cross-sectional. Researchers were unable to ascertain if residents' conceptualizations of quality shift over time. For example, as suggested by one of the anonymous reviewers of this article, it may be that residents become increasingly "institutionalized" as their stays lengthen, adopting definitions of quality that are more congruent with those of their care providers. The design of this study also did not allow linkages between resident conceptualizations of quality and resident characteristics such as socioeconomic (SES) or functional status.In the future, it will be important to determine the generalizability of the three types of care quality definitions described in this article. Further research might test the associations between functional status (and characteristics like SES, race, and gender) and resident definitions of care quality. It might also develop a "natural history" of resident conceptualizations of quality through longitudinal study, and look at the relationship between resident perceptions of quality and contextual factors such as facility staffing levels and the nature of resident/staff relationships.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined response, participation, time, and costs for a telephone-administered survey to obtain comprehensive information on general health, eating habits, living environment, and functional status from a sample of older persons in a rural North Carolina county. Design and Methods: A probability sample of persons aged 60 years and older from the most recent electoral rolls were mailed a personalized letter, which was followed by telephone contact to recruit them into a contemporaneous survey that used a modified version of the Nutrition Screening Initiative's Level I and II screens. Time requirements and costs associated with the completion of surveys were calculated. Results: Seventy-six percent of the persons contacted by telephone (residents of 96% of county precincts) completed the survey. Because minority elders were more likely to lack a working telephone, they were underrepresented in the sample. With 555 calling attempts (58% of surveys completed on first attempt), we estimated a cost of $10.65 per completed survey. Implications:Telephone-administered surveying of older adults may be considered as an appropriate component of an overall community-based service strategy. The estimation of the constituents of nutritional risk, by geographic area, economic status, or ethnicity, may aid in providing estimates of service needs and procuring and allocating resources. Additional methods of data collection are necessary in order to target older persons without telephone service.   Nutrition screening ,  Telephone surveys ,  Community-based nutrition programs Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDCommunity-based service providers grapple with the challenges of a dramatically increasing older population: divergent aging patterns, needs, and expectations (Balsam and Bottum 1997   ; Hoogenboom, Spangler, and Crose 1998   ), as well as increased risk for poor nutrition and functional disabilities (Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley, Bales, and Fillenbaum 1994   ; Jensen, Kita, Fish, and Heydt 1997   ; Ponza, Ohls, and Millen 1996   ). The challenges to community-based service providers are especially monumental in rural areas, where a disproportionate percentage of older persons have poorer health, suffer from more chronic diseases, and are more vulnerable to poor nutritional status (AbuSabha et al. 1997   ; Blazer, Landerman, Fillenbaum, and Horner 1995   ; Mainous and Kohrs 1995   ; Schoenberg, Coward, Gilbert, and Mullens 1997   ). Compounding these challenges are concerns about accessibility of services, availability of resources, service coordination, quality of care, individual characteristics, and integration of services (Arcury, Quandt, Bell, McDonald, and Vitolins 1998   ; Magilvy 1996   ). And these concerns are linked to determining which older persons are most likely to be at nutritional and functional risk, and how best to provide assistance (Arcury et al. 1998   ; Benjamin-Coleman and Alexy 1999   ). This article reports our efforts to examine the feasibility of telephone surveying to identify nutritional and functional risk among noninstitutionalized older persons in a predominately rural North Carolina county.The available survey methods for determining nutritional risk and functional status include face-to-face, direct mail, and telephone-administered surveys, each of which has trade-offs with regard to response rates, expense, respondent burden, anonymity, and completion rates (Gibson, Koepsell, Diehr, and Hale 1999   ). Although the increasing popularity of telephone surveys is the result of many factors, including increased telephone coverage and documented similarity of response between telephone and face-to-face interviews (Fox, Heimendinger, and Block 1992   ; Herzog and Rodgers 1988   ; Slutske et al. 1998   ), telephone interviews with older adults have been utilized primarily to recruit older subjects for research studies (AbuSabha et al. 1997   ; Taylor-Davis, Smiciklas-Wright, Davis, Jensen, and Mitchell 1998   ) and to collect data from previously recruited study populations (Lahmann and Kumanyika 1999   ; Schaffer, Coates, Caan, Slattery, and Potter 1997   ). Little is known about the use or costs of telephone surveying by community-based service providers, especially in rural areas, to determine current and future nutritional and functional needs of older adults in the community who do not currently receive services. At present, for most providers of nutrition services for the elderly population, the only available information on nutritional risk and functional status is through data routinely collected on program participants (Ponza et al. 1996   ; Sharkey, Haines, and Zohoori 2000   ). Without an understanding of the components of nutritional and functional risk among the vast majority of nonparticipating older persons, nutrition programs are limited in their ability to assist an increasing number of older persons to remain independent in the community; to plan future programs; to procure additional resources; to target interventions; and to tailor programs to the disparate needs within their community.We extended this understanding by examining the response and participation rates, time requirements, and costs for a two-stage process (postal contact followed by telephone surveys) for obtaining comprehensive information on general health, eating habits, living environment, and functional status from a probability sample of noninstitutionalized older persons. Methods Potential Respondents Based on an anticipated 35% response rate for survey completion, a computer-based selection process was used to generate a probability sample from the 6,696 persons aged 60 years and older on the 1998 voter registration list for Chatham County, North Carolina. The voter registration list included approximately 72% of the estimated total number of older persons who reside in the 708 square mile rural county and mirrored two of the known county demographics: 55% of the population female and 84% White. Each entry provided name, address, voting precinct (area of county), phone number (when available), age (date of birth), and race. The age restriction (at least 60 years of age) matched the age eligibility requirements for nondisabled and nonspousal participants in the Elderly Nutrition Program under the Older Americans Act (Ponza et al. 1996   ).The decision was made a priori to recruit until 150 interviews were completed. A personalized advance letter (Dillman 1978   ) from the Chatham County Council on Aging was sent to potential respondents 2 weeks prior to the telephone interview. The letter introduced the Council on Aging as a nonprofit source of Senior Services in Chatham County, emphasized the importance of the respondent's participation, and indicated that the survey results would assist in planning future services. The letter further described the survey topics, provided assurance of confidentiality and voluntary participation, and listed a contact number at the Council on Aging for any questions concerning the survey. In addition, both the executive director of the Council on Aging and the survey coordinator (J.R.S.) signed each letter. The probability sample was partitioned into sequential mailing groups. The first group of letters was mailed; the mailing was followed by telephone contact with the first group. At the time the first group was contacted by telephone, the next group of letters was mailed. As the members of that group were contacted, a third group of letters was mailed. The goal of 150 completed interviews was reached prior to contact with everyone in the third group (119 individuals were never contacted). The participants were not offered compensation for their participation in the study.The telephone interviewers were trained in conducting interviews with older individuals. Included in the training were the importance of the introduction of the telephone interview, conducting the interview, answering respondent's questions, completing the survey form, and completing the phone logs. Calls were attempted between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. At the request of the Council on Aging, no calls were made on Sundays. A standard script for the introduction, which included the use of human subjects' disclosure and informed consent agreement, guided the interviewers (Taylor-Davis et al. 1998   ). The telephone interviews were conducted from March 1999 to May 1999.A tracking system was developed in which all potential respondents contacted by telephone were identified as "contacted for interview." Of those who were contacted, "participants" completed the survey and "nonparticipants" refused to complete the survey. Potential respondents were eliminated from the sample if they were unable to be contacted for any of the following reasons: no telephone, telephone not working or wrong number, deceased or transferred to a nursing home, or three unsuccessful attempts to contact. Using the most recent countywide telephone directories, every effort was made to locate telephone numbers for entries missing a number. A prospective respondent was eliminated from the sample due to no telephone when there were both a missing telephone number on the voter registration list and no listed telephone number by name or address in the telephone directory.Age, sex, race, and residence (as determined by voting precinct) data were kept on all "contacted for interview" and "unable to contact" respondents for comparison. The actual response rate was defined (Last 1995   ) as the number of completed interviews (n = 152) divided by the total number of persons who would have been surveyed if all had participated (n = 322). This excludes those who were never contacted because the study achieved the goal of 150 completed interviews (n = 119). The participation rate was determined to be the percentage of persons contacted for an interview (n = 201) who completed the survey; the nonparticipation rate was the percentage of persons contacted who refused to participate in the survey.Telephone logs were maintained by the interviewers and collected by the survey coordinator each calling day. The information on the logs included date of call, time of call, telephone number, attempt number, person called, survey number, outcome, and pertinent notes (e.g., message left on machine). The outcome was coded for the following events: no answer, busy, answering machine, telephone not in service, telephone temporarily disconnected, wrong number, respondent unavailable, respondent refused to participate, appointment scheduled for survey, and completed interview. The pertinent notes section was used to indicate a scheduled appointment time, message left, and any other information the interviewer felt was relevant. Survey Instrument The 67-item survey instrument was adapted from the Nutrition Screening Initiative's Level I and II Screens (Nutrition Screening Initiative 1996   ) and partitioned into four domains: general health, eating habits, living environment, and functional status. The 9 questions of the general health domain asked about weight change, medication, tobacco and alcohol use, and chronic health conditions. Eating habits included 16 questions that addressed availability of food, eating alone, chewing or swallowing difficulties, shopping and meal preparation, and normal intake of specific food group items and fluids. Living environment was evaluated with 16 questions concerned with income, household composition, security, adequate heating, cooling or refrigeration, transportation, and daily social contacts. The functional status questions referred to the individual components of the Activities of Daily Living (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffe 1963   ), the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Lawton and Brody 1969   ), and any hospitalizations in the previous 12 months. Costs The costs for recruitment of respondents were calculated in a similar manner as reported by Taylor-Davis and colleagues 1998   . The costs of mailing included supplies for envelopes, letterhead paper, labels and printing, labor for creating the labels and personalized introductory letters, assembly of letters, and postage. Telephone screening costs included wages for interviewer training, attempts to contact prospective respondents, survey time, supplies (e.g., telephone logs and feedback forms), and actual telephone charges. All wage costs were determined at a rate of $10 per hour. Because the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of community-based telephone screening, the costs did not include expenses associated with development and printing of the screening instrument or the expenses associated with data entry and analysis of the screening instrument. Because the Chatham County Council on Aging is a nonprofit service provider, there was no charge for the age-specific (ages ≥ 60 years) voter registration list. We assume this to be the case for other nonprofit service providers. Data Management and Analysis The survey instrument provided age, sex, and race of respondent, along with starting and ending times for the survey. All information was key entered from hard copy into a relational database, using Microsoft® Access 97 for Windows (Microsoft Corporation 1997   ). Proportions by age, sex, and race; participation rate; number of attempts required for contact; and length of participant calls were calculated. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare men with women, participants with nonparticipants, contacted with unable to contact, and Blacks with Whites. The Student's t test was used to compare the mean age of participants with nonparticipants and contacted with unable to contact. The chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, t tests, and tabulations were performed using Stata Statistical Software, Release 6.0 (StataCorp 1999   ). Results The overall response rate of 47% (152 completed interviews/322 potential respondents) included the 49 individuals who refused to participate and the 121 who were unable to be contacted (see  Fig. 1 ). At the completion of 150 interviews, attempts to contact potential respondents were discontinued; however, 2 additional interviews were completed in response to messages left on answering machines. From the 441 mailed letters, it was not necessary to contact 119 potential respondents (27%) in order to complete the study.Sixty-two percent (n = 201) of the 322 potential respondents were contacted for an interview. Of the 201 older persons contacted by phone, 152 (76%) participated in the survey and 49 (24%) refused to participate. As shown in  Table 1  , there were no significant differences in age, gender, or race between the participants and nonparticipants. There were, however, significant race differences among all potential respondents: Blacks were less likely than Whites to be contacted (27.5% vs. 69%, p < .000), which was likely to be explained by lack of a telephone among a higher proportion of Blacks (51.4% vs. 29.8%, p = .023). Although not statistically significant, the telephone not working or a wrong number was more prevalent among Whites who were unable to be contacted compared with Blacks (36.9% vs. 27%, p = .290). Participants were drawn from all areas of the county (as determined by the voting precinct) with a couple of notable exceptions: 2 of the 20 precincts (approximately 4% of the registered voters) were not represented among the participants (1 precinct was among the refusals only) and 2 of the precincts were overrepresented (48.7% of participants vs. 33.9% of the registered voters).One hundred twenty-one potential respondents (37.6%) were eliminated from the study: 44 (13.7% of the 322 potential respondents) without a telephone, 11 with nonoperating telephone, 30 with incorrect telephone number, 6 deceased, 1 residing in a nursing home, and 29 with three unsuccessful calling attempts. It required 555 calling attempts in order to complete 152 interviews (approximately 3.6 calling attempts per completed interview). All persons who agreed to participate in the interview completed the survey. Of the 49 nonparticipants, 67% did not provide a reason for refusal; 14% stated that they were not interested in participating; and 10% expressed difficulty in hearing. Among the participants, 58% were interviewed on the first calling attempt (n = 88), 30% on the second (n = 46), and 12% on the third (n = 18). The average telephone interview lasted 12.4 min (±6.2 min); the longest interview was 46 min. Of the surveys, 48% were completed in 10 min or less and another 41% in 11 to 20 min. Saturday was the most successful day for contacts, followed by Thursday after 5:00 p.m. The fewest contacts were made between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Table 2  shows the mailing and telephone costs for completing 152 interviews. Because this article focuses on telephone interviewing as a method for information gathering, the costs do not include survey instrument design, the cost of printing the actual survey, data entry of the results of the completed surveys, and survey data analysis. Therefore, the total cost for 152 participants was $1,619.45, with an estimated cost of $10.65 per completed interview. Discussion With an increased emphasis on the shift of health care to community- and home-based programs, innovative ways to provide effective nutrition services across a continuum of care become especially important (Institute of Medicine 2000   ). These may include targeted programs of screening, nutrition intervention (i.e., meals, home care services, dental services, and pharmacist advice), nutrition education, and counseling. However, community-based nutrition programs for older adults often lack sufficient information to determine nutritional and functional service needs among their nonclient community. The findings suggest that telephone-administered surveying may be an appropriate component of an overall service strategy, especially in rural areas.We believe this is the first report to characterize time and costs ($10.65 per completed survey) for participant recruitment and survey completion from a probability sample of noninstitutionalized older adults in a predominately rural county. Prior research has focused on the costs for participant recruitment from a patient database of a tertiary-care hospital into a subsequent study (Taylor-Davis et al. 1998   ). In 1999-adjusted dollars (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 2000   ), Taylor-Davis and colleagues 1998    estimated a cost of $9.36 per recruited participant for an introductory letter and telephone recruitment into a future study of home-based nutrition education. By comparison, we calculated a cost in 1999 dollars of $10.65 for the introductory letter, telephone recruitment, and survey completion.Our overall response rate of 47% and participation rate of 76% for recruitment and study completion are higher than previously reported for recruitment into research studies (Boult, Boult, Morishita, and Pirie 1998   ; Herzog and Rodgers 1988   ; Stuck et al. 1995   ; Taylor-Davis et al. 1998   ). While Taylor-Davis and colleagues 1998    reported a 37% overall response rate (480/1300) and 45% participation (recruitment) rate, Stuck and colleagues 1995    reported a 37% recruitment response using a voter registration list. In a telephone follow-up to an existing project, Benjamin-Coleman and Alexy 1999    reported a 64% participation rate.This study required an average of 3.6 calling attempts (555 total attempts) in order to complete 152 interviews, with 58% of the surveys completed on the first attempt and another 30% on the second attempt. This is a lower average number of calling attempts per recruitment and higher percentage of recruitment on the first calling attempt than previously reported (Taylor-Davis et al. 1998   ). Our higher participation rate and lower average number of calling attempts may be the result of a number of factors: (a) the individually signed and personalized introductory letters from the Council on Aging; (b) collaboration with a well-respected community-based provider of services for older adults; and (c) minimal respondent burden. Because study participation occurred at the time of the calling attempt, potential respondents were not burdened with the prospect for a future in-home or clinic visit.Although electoral rolls are a convenient frame from which to choose random samples for telephone surveys (Smith, Mitchell, Attebo, and Leeder 1997   ), all older adults are not listed in this sampling frame. In Chatham County, approximately 72% of all older persons are registered voters (73% of the estimated older White and 62% of estimated older Black populations). Little has been published about the characteristics of older adults excluded from research because they are not registered voters. However, other sources of potential respondents are problematic for community-based studies: driver registration provides limited numbers of elders, especially in rural areas; senior centers or other community-based services are not widely used by most elders; and random-digit dialing (Mainous and Kohrs 1995   ; Olsen and Mandel 1988   ) is expensive, with wasted effort for checking out unused and nonresidential phones (Dillman 1978   ) and the residential phones of nontarget persons. There were advantages to the use of electoral rolls in our study: (a) the rolls were provided to the Chatham County Council on Aging at no cost; and (b) the rolls provided information on age, sex, race, and precinct of county residence, which could be used to compare responders with nonresponders and provide addresses for alternative methods of contact.We were unsuccessful in surveying minority elders in proportion to their representation in the overall older adult population. This presents another limitation to the exclusive use of electoral rolls: a large number of older adults, especially minority elders, are apparently without a telephone number. In addition to not having a telephone, other reasons for an absence of a telephone number could include refusal to provide a telephone number or access to telephone service through family or friends. From the entire Chatham County voter list, we found a large number of older persons who did not indicate the presence of a telephone (39% of Blacks and 20% of Whites). There also appears to be a difference according to ethnic background for lack of a telephone number by age group: the largest percentage of Blacks without a telephone number were aged 60–74 (41% of Blacks); Whites were aged 85 years and older (29% of Whites). After examining all area telephone directories by name and by address, we reported 13.7% of our study respondents were without a telephone. Our estimated telephone coverage is in sharp contrast to the reported 3.3% of potential respondents, aged 60 years and older, from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the 2.7% of persons aged 65 years and older from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Access to Health Care Supplement (Anderson, Nelson, and Wilson 1998   ; Ford 1998   ). Both studies reported that socioeconomic variables, region, and locale might explain part of the differences in telephone coverage. In the NHANES III report, those without a telephone were characterized as more likely to be non-White, less educated, poorer, and to live outside an urban area (Ford 1998   ). On the basis of the 1994 NHIS Access to Health Care Supplement, Anderson and colleagues 1998    found the following indicators of lowest telephone coverage: living in South region, being Black, living in nonmetropolitan areas, being poor, and being Black below the poverty level.Economic factors may not be the only explanation for the absence of a telephone number for so many registered voters. Many may refuse to provide a telephone number or may live with someone else and not have a telephone listed in their name. Although telephone surveys may represent a practical and economical method for the expansion and development of community interventions based on the assessment of local needs (Fox et al. 1992   ; Posner, Borman, Morgan, Borden, and Ohls 1982   ), the exclusive reliance on telephone-administered surveys will possibly exclude some individuals most in need of supplemental aging services, including the very poor (Fox et al. 1992   ; Mainous and Kohrs 1995   ), non-English speakers, cognitively impaired elders, minorities, and persons with moderate or high limitations because of chronic conditions including the hearing impaired and persons too ill or restricted in mobility to operate a telephone for moderate periods of time (Ford 1998   ; Marcus and Crane 1986   ). Given that low-income populations have a high proportion of disconnected numbers or lack telephones (Gibson et al. 1999   ), and that a disproportionately high percentage of the rural older adult population may be without a telephone, it is necessary to complement the telephone screening with another method of survey administration for older adults at elevated risk for poor nutrition and functional disability. Additional approaches could include limited mailings, generally considered less expensive than telephone contact, and face-to-face contact, which is generally more expensive than telephone surveys (Morris, Colditz, and Evans 1998   ; Taylor-Davis et al. 1998   ).There are several implications of these findings for rural nutrition service providers. First, telephone-administered surveys provide a feasible method to cover a broader range of older adults. Second, telephone-administered interviewing allows providers to quickly target specific subsets of the older population (e.g., geographic area, income, and minority status). Third, electoral rolls provide a source for potential respondents, which can be sorted by geographic area, race, age, and gender. Fourth, telephone-administered surveys may alert providers to non-clients who may be at elevated risk for adverse health outcomes. Fifth, there are serious financial implications. Scarce resources, especially in rural areas, may make it difficult to consider spending $10.65 per participant for interviewing an entire county. Limited resources may require a method for identifying individuals at greater risk through stratification by income level, educational attainment, or other criteria. Finally, no single method will identify individuals most at risk of inadequate nutritional intake. Although telephone-administered interviewing, as demonstrated in this study, is effective, many older adults considered to be at greatest risk of poor nutrition are without a telephone. Although one alternative may be the use of mailed-response surveys, Morris, Mendes de Leon, Tangney, Evans, and Bienias 1999    found that personal contact would be required for participation among Blacks. Considering that many older persons will be without a telephone or have difficulty or reluctance in completing a mailed survey, some face-to-face interviewing may be required.The results of this study have contributed to the understanding of the feasibility of community-based, telephone-administered surveying of older adults by service providers. Although this study reports an encouraging participation rate as well as efficient and effective time and costs for a voter list–based telephone interview, we recommend three specific changes in our methods to further increase the coverage and response rate: (a) increase the number of calling attempts beyond three; (b) attempt to convert refusals; and (c) study supplemental methods in order to target older adults who lack a working telephone or are absent from voter registration lists, such as determining the availability of alternate sources of names of noninstitutionalized older persons, and working with churches, ministerial associations, senior centers, and other service providers.The telephone-administered survey of nutritional and functional health has the potential to assist community-based service providers in meeting the challenges of a burgeoning older population with ever-increasing needs for home- and community-based nutrition services. The estimation of the constituents of nutritional risk, by geographic area, economic status, or ethnicity, will aid in providing accurate and proactive estimates of service needs.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: To develop an instrument that can be used to answer three questions: What is the prevalence of ageism in various societies? Which types of ageism are more prevalent? Which subgroups of older people report more ageism? Methods: A survey instrument was developed listing 20 types of ageism. This instrument was tested on a convenience sample of 84 persons older than age 60. Results: The instrument appears to have satisfactory reliability and validity. The survey found that the experience of ageism was widespread and frequent among these respondents. The majority reported several incidents of ageism and over half of the incidents were reported to have occurred "more than once." The most frequent types were persons showing disrespect for older people, followed by persons showing assumptions about ailments or frailty caused by age. Implications: Researchers now have a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the prevalence of ageism in various societies and of various types of ageism experienced by various groups of older persons. This may aid in reducing the prevalence of ageism in our society.   Ageism ,  Prevalence ,  Instrument Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDAgeism has been called the ultimate prejudice, the last discrimination, the cruelest rejection. I believe it is the third great "ism" in our society, after racism and sexism. Like racism and sexism, it is prejudice or discrimination against a category of people—in this case, against older people (Butler 1995   ).But ageism is different in two ways from the other "isms": everyone may become a target of ageism if they live long enough, and many people are unaware of it, because it is a relatively new and subtle concept. Nevertheless, ageism is widespread in our society, in contrast to more traditional societies where old age is honored and respected (Palmore and Maeda 1985   ).Yet nobody knows how much ageism there is, nor how prevalent the various forms of ageism are in different societies and different groups. This is because, up to now, no one has developed a way to measure ageism. In order to develop such a measure, I have designed and tested an "Ageism Survey" (see Appendix) with 20 items and with questions about the respondent's age, gender, and education.I hope this survey will be used to answer three basic questions:What is the prevalence of ageism in this and other societies?Which types of ageism are more prevalent?Which subgroups of older people report more ageism? Methods The items in the survey were developed from the literature on ageism (Barrow and Smith 1979   ; Bythway 1995   ; Palmore 1999   ), discussions with colleagues, and experiences of older persons. The types of ageism included in this survey are based on the theoretical typology I developed (Palmore 1999   ). This typology first points out that there can be negative and positive forms of ageism. However, only negative forms of ageism are included in this survey in order to keep it simple. Secondly, the typology distinguishes between prejudice (which includes stereotypes and attitudes) and discrimination (which includes personal acts and institutional policies). The survey includes examples of stereotypes, attitudes, personal and institutional discrimination.The respondents were invited to "Put a number in the blank that shows how often you have experienced that event: Never = 0; Once = 1; More than once = 2."The survey items were tested on a convenience sample of 84 persons older than age 60 in local senior centers and a church group, and who responded to a preliminary publication of the survey in the Center Report (Palmore 2000   ). The sample was 35% male and 65% female; the age range was 60–93 with a mean of 75 years; and the distribution by education was 39% with high school or less, 31% with some college, and 30% with postgraduate education. The first 21 respondents were not asked about education, but because they were from a senior center in a public housing project, we imputed "high school or less" education for that group. I know from personal experience with this housing project that few if any residents have more than a high school education.Internal reliability was tested using the Cronbach Coefficient Alpha. A factor analysis of principal components was used to test for communality. Differences between groups were tested using Chi-square or the Wilcoxen two-sample test. Results Reliability and Validity The survey instrument appears to have satisfactory characteristics for an inventory of types of ageism experienced. It appears to have one main factor with an Eigenvalue of 4.74. The Cronbach Coefficient Alpha (a measure of internal reliability) is .81. There were three items that did not correlate well with the total scores because there were few respondents reporting those items (numbers 6, 8, and 14). Reliability would be increased if we omitted those items, but we decided to keep them because they represent the more serious types of ageism (discrimination in leadership, rental housing, and employment).The items appear to have high face validity. A panel of older persons and colleagues were asked what they thought each item meant. All the respondents seemed to understand the items without further explanations. There were few omitted responses (those few were coded as "0"). Prevalence The results show that ageism is perceived as widespread and frequent by the majority of respondents. Over 77% reported experiencing one or more incidents of ageism; and more than half of the reported incidents were reported to have occurred "more than once." Each item in the survey was reported as having been experienced by one or more persons; and the average item was reported by about one fifth of the respondents. Frequent Types The percentages reporting each type of ageism are presented in  Table 1  . The most frequent type of ageism, reported by 58 percent, was Item 1: "I was told a joke that pokes fun at old people."Other frequent types of showing disrespect were Item 2 ("birthday card that pokes fun": 30%); Item 3 ("ignored": 31%); Item 4 ("insulting name": 18%); Item 5 ("patronized": 39%); and Item 10 ("less dignity and respect": 30%).However, another set of frequent types of ageism dealt with assumptions about ailments or frailty being caused by age: Item 12 ("A doctor or nurse assumed my ailments were caused by my age") and Item 18, ("Someone told me I was too old for that") were both reported by 43%.Item 12 assumes that chronological age causes diseases, when in fact chronological age does not "cause" anything. Item 18 assumes that age causes frailty and/or it reflects a stereotype about "age-appropriate behavior."Other frequent assumptions about age causing disability are reflected in Items 16, "Someone assumed I could not hear well because of my age" (33%), and 17, "Someone assumed I could not understand because of my age" (32%).The least frequent items had to do with specific and severe discrimination, such as Items 6 ("refused rental housing": only 1 report), 19 ("house was vandalized": 6%), and 20 ("victimized by a criminal": 4%). Differences Between Groups I analyzed the differences by age, gender, and education as to the frequency of items reported. I had expected that older people would report more ageism, but I found little difference between those respondents older and younger than age 75 in the frequency of items reported. Similarly, I had expected that women would report more ageism because they also suffer from sexism. I had theorized that experiencing sexism would make women more sensitive to other forms of discrimination such as ageism. Also, I thought that people in general might perceive women as being more vulnerable to ageism because of their "minority" status as women. But again, I found little difference between men and women in the frequency of items reported.I did find that respondents with less education tended to report more experiences of ageism than those with more education: Respondents with high school or less education reported an average of 5 types of incidents; those with college education reported 4; and those with postgraduate education reported 3.5. Although these differences were not statistically significant, it may be that persons with less education are more vulnerable to incidents of ageism. Of course, because less education tends to be associated with lower income, one cannot untangle the effects of education and income in this survey. Discussion The major problem with interpreting these findings is the ambiguity of what caused the report of ageism (or lack of a report). A given incident could be reported because it actually happened and was correctly perceived as an example of ageism; or it may not have really been a case of ageism, but because of hypersensitivity it was perceived as such.On the other hand, a real incident of ageism may have occurred, but was not reported because it was not perceived as ageism, or because a person might not want to admit in a survey that he or she had experienced that form of ageism.This is a general problem in interpreting results from any attempt to measure the extent of prejudice and discrimination, as in studies of racism and sexism. Other methods, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, or experiments could help clarify these alternate interpretations.Actually, an explicit measure of perceived ageism, such as this survey, may be less problematic than explicit measures of racism and sexism, because this survey does not ask people to admit that they themselves have engaged in ageist acts, but rather to report on ageist acts that others have done to them.Whatever the explanation for these results, it appears that researchers now have a reasonably reliable and valid instrument for measuring the prevalence of ageism in general and of various types of ageism in various groups of older persons.Future research is needed to use this survey on larger samples in various groups and cultures. Also it would be interesting to see what effects, if any, response bias has because the items are all worded in the positive direction. This version of the survey worded all the items in the positive direction to keep it simple and easy to understand. Also of interest would be to include some items dealing with "positive ageism," discrimination in favor of older persons.I hope that this instrument may be useful in attempts to reduce ageism. Hopefully, it may make people more aware of the many forms of ageism they and others may have been perpetuating. Also it could be the basis for more effective programs to reduce ageism, because researchers could better understand which groups suffer from more ageism and which types of ageism are more prevalent. This could develop an "epidemiology of ageism" as a first step toward its eradication.  None  Table 1.

     Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDOne of the earliest expressions of the phenomenon now termed ageism appeared in Max Lerner 1957    monumental volume, America as a Civilization:It is natural for the culture to treat the old like the fag end of what was once good material… The most flattering thing you can say to an older American is that he "doesn't look his age" and "doesn't act his age"—as if it were the most damning thing in the world to look old…Since the American has been taught that success belongs to push and youth, it is hard to revere those who no longer possess either. One can be fond of them, tolerate them, take reluctant care of them, speak whimsically of the crotchetyness and frailties; but these are far from the genuine homage of heart and mind. To build a code of conduct toward the old requires not only personal kindliness but generations of the pratice of values from which the old are not excluded—of which they are the summation…The style of aging in America is not a graceful one. It is filled with constant efforts to fight off anxieties, until one encounters what Martin Gumpert has called the "shock of aging"—the sharp recognition (usually associated with disease) that one is "done for" and the final loss of confidence that comes with it. There come then, as Albrecht and Havighurst have put it, the "insults" that assail the aging person—the loss of physical attractiveness, the loss of life partners and friends through death, the loss of status, the loss of useful and respected roles in the family and culture, and the final insult of being imprisoned in a body which is the shell of its earlier self. (pp. 613–614)Lerner's observations are relevant because they disclose an understanding of ageism somewhat more complex than that disclosed by the survey instrument discussed by Palmore 2001    in this issue of The Gerontologist. Careful reading of the survey suggests not only a deep-seated cultural set of values, but also the "buy-in" by older people themselves about the intrinsic devaluation of old age by society at large.Lerner's observations, now almost half a century old, no longer comport completely with today's realities of legal and social relationships of the elderly population and the larger U.S. society. Butler's subsequent coining of the term ageism at a public meeting in 1969 (Bernstein 1969   ), its further explication that year (Butler 1969   ), its distinction from gerontophobia (Palmore 1972   ), the explicit definition in Butler and Lewis 1973   , and Butler 1975    further explication launched the concept in gerontology.So much has changed even in the last quarter century that examination of the phenomenon should move well beyond mere subjective assessments of "ageism" by its objects. Gerontologists and social activists can and should probe more deeply into the nature and source of ageism.Ageism is complex. Butler and Lewis's definition, quoted and commented on in Why Survive? Growing Old in America (Butler 1975   ), probably requires some refinement:Ageism can be seen as a process of systematic stereotyping of and discrimination against people because they are old, just as racism and sexism accomplish this with skin color and gender. Old people are categorized as senile, rigid in thought and manner, old-fashioned in morality and skills… Ageism allows the younger generations to see older people as different from themselves; thus they subtly cease to identify with their elders as human beings.Today, given legislative enactments regarding age discrimination in employment and in some other areas, it is clear that some ageism has now moved from the arena of morality and moral obligation to the arena of legal obligation. That kind of ageism (reflected in Palmore's Items 6, 14, and 15) appears to be encountered least, judging from the percentage reporting never encountering such (99%, 95%, and 90% respectively; Table 1, Palmore 2001   ).At the other end of the spectrum, the highest-rated ageist encounters were "Told a joke that pokes fun" (42% reporting 0 events), "Doctor or nurse assumed ailments caused by age" and "Told me ‘you’re too old for that'"(57% reporting 0 events for both items).Palmore's survey seems to assume that all jokes about old age are ageist in nature. However, any review of humor and racism or anti-semitism, for example, would have to distinguish between the standup comedy of Godfrey Cambridge, Richard Pryor, and Chris Rock—comedy going back over three decades or more—and the racist humor approaching near scatalogical proportions of "Coon Songs," a category of American popular music in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Similarly, one would have to distinguish between the "Jewish humor" presented by comics like Jackie Mason, Myron Cohen, Buddy Hackett, and Mel Brooks and the humor set out in neo-Nazi literature.African Americans tell jokes about Black people, peppering such with the N-word and other epithets that are not racist in the common sense, but rather are often intended to point out the absurdity in racism. Thus, racism in humor may be a function of the messenger rather than of the precise words of the message. Palmore's assumption about jokes in the survey is too broad and undifferentiated.More subtle and difficult to identify are the events of the marketplace. What does the age distribution of CEOs and COOs of dot com and internet technology companies say about ageism (which we might suggest includes age preference)? Or, what would an age distribution of key players in the Gerontological Society of America, the American Society on Aging, the Association for Gerontology in Higher Education, or the American Geriatrics Society reveal? Are senior discounts and early bird specials reflections of ageism and, if so, how are these ubiquitous signs reflected in the survey? To what extent are ads portraying super-elders water skiing, playing polo, tennis, and so forth ageist by virtue of holding up to praise those who are able to continue being young, active, vigorous? Was the National Council on Aging/Advertising Council of America campaign a few years ago inherently offensive by virtue of its "Get Off Your Rocker!" theme, by suggesting that people in rockers either by preference or by virtue of disability were not as worthy as those who "got off their rockers" and participated? Did the campaign reinforce or break down stereotypes?There is a difference between the too frequent dismissals of physical and medical complaints of the elderly by physicians and health professionals (Palmore's Items 12 and 13 specifically, and possibly Items 5, 10, 16, and 18) and the straightforward queries or comments of health professionals about vision, hearing, memory, balance, and urination, all of which involve age-associated declines or problems. How does the survey distinguish between the subjective processing by the elder and benign or malign intent of the professional?Just as we learned that actual crime against elderly persons was not off the charts and that it was the fear of crime that was prevalent far beyond the incidence of crime, so it might be that perceptions of ageism by older adults may outstrip the event. Or, it may not. The point is that ageism does not necessarily exist because some elderly people may believe that it does.This survey presented by Palmore 2001    is, at best, a survey of perceptions of ageism. As such it is an excellent starting point for the systematic inquiry into ageism. The inquiry cannot avoid the intensive qualitative research that delves behind the perceptions of elderly people. Nor can it avoid examining the processes by which commercial, educational, eleemosynary, and service organizations select their respective leaders and participants and whether age distributions reflect ageism, age-appropriate activity, or some other factors altogether.Dr. Palmore 2001    concludes too much from his survey as it now stands. However, the survey, whatever its limits, requires gerontologists to consider ageism more systematically. Palmore's analysis forces attention not only on the benighted, inconsiderate, ignorant, and unkind ageist, but also on the self-hating elderly people who have bought into the negative stereotypes and who promote staying middle-aged (or younger) forever. Rosalie Rosenfelt 1965    gave eloquent articulation to the phenomenon she aptly termed "the elderly mystique." To what extent is what she described still the case? And to what extent does socioeconomic status make a difference? I have a hunch that elderly college professors have a very different "ageism experience" from the retired bank teller or self-employed electrician or family farmer. And I would suspect that housing, community circumstances and environment, and presence or absence of family also affect perceptions of ageist encounters.Ageism, like racism, sexism, and homophobia, is complex in its generation and in its perception. It deserves more and better attention than it has received. Dr. Palmore deserves our profound thanks for his provocative piece.

     Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDDr. Palmore 2001    Ageism Survey is a much-needed contribution toward creating awareness about a form of prejudice and discrimination that has been largely ignored by our society. However, the survey omits measuring two components of ageism that have emerged from a series of recent findings. These studies have found that ageism can operate (a) implicitly, or without awareness, and (b) in the form of aging self-stereotypes, or older individuals' beliefs about the elderly population. To achieve Dr. Palmore's goal of establishing an "‘epidemiology of ageism’ as a first step toward its eradication," it seems that these two components might warrant consideration. Implicit Ageism The groundwork for current studies of implicit ageism was laid more than one hundred years ago by William James's studies of automatic processes and Sigmund Freud's exploration of the unconscious. Recent social psychological research has employed new techniques for studying these phenomena. Although the studies on implicit prejudice have focused on racism and sexism, a growing number examine the operation of implicit ageism.Several aspects of implicit ageism deserve mention. First, "implicit ageism" is defined as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward elderly people that exist and operate without conscious awareness or control, with the assumption that it forms the basis of most interactions with older individuals (Levy and Banaji in press   ). Second, every socialized individual who has internalized the age stereotypes of their culture is likely to engage in implicit ageism. Third, like explicit ageism, implicit ageism can be positive or negative; however, because most age stereotypes in the United States tend to be negative (Kite and Johnson 1988   ), implicit ageism also tends to be mostly negative (Perdue and Gurtman 1990   ). A survey of implicit ageism found that 95% of the participants had negative views of old people; this is a higher proportion than for implicit racism or sexism (Banaji 1999   ).A number of studies have found that a disassociation exists between implicit and explicit measures of prejudice. That is, individuals who are opposed to racism or sexism on explicit surveys often demonstrate prejudice toward African Americans or women on implicit measures (Blair and Banaji 1996   ; Dasgupta, McGhee, Greenwald, and Banaji 2000   ; Devine 1989   ). My colleagues and I have found that regardless of individuals' explicit views of aging, they can be influenced by negative implicit age stereotypes (Levy 1996   ; Levy, Hausdorff, Hencke, and Wei 2000   ; for a review of the primary forms of implicit measures used to measure age stereotypes, see Levy and Banaji in press   ).If individuals are not aware that a negative stereotype of age has been automatically triggered by a person's older age, they are likely to attribute their behaviors (e.g., refusal to hire or to rent an apartment) to another factor that better fits their preferred self-images as reasonably fair individuals. Thus, rather than acknowledge that "I hired a younger person in preference to an older person," a rationalization, such as the older applicant's personality or training, might be evoked.Further, if such explanations for ageist behavior are given to older people, they may accept these attributions, especially if the relative youth of the other candidates is not known. Even if older persons suspect a behavior was influenced by age, they may not want to admit to themselves that they have encountered ageism. The reason for this is that the aging process has been societally defined in negative terms (Butler 1980   ; Zebrowitz and Montepare 2000   ). It may, therefore, be easier for individuals to not acknowledge that they have been designated, through ageist acts, as members of a stigmatized group: the old.Given the multitude of choices most people have for their free time, the behavior that may be especially vulnerable to implicit ageism is the failure to visit an older person. Unlike hiring, for instance, this type of behavior allows for benign neglect. Research has found that implicit evaluations influence whether an individual approaches or avoids another person (Chen and Bargh 1999   ). Further, if the avoidance is due to implicit ageism, the individual avoiding the older person may attribute this distancing to other factors, and the older person who is not visited may blame the lack of contact on the busy life of the younger person. There could be a broader impact of this avoidance insofar as meaningful intergenerational contact may be one of the most effective ways to reduce ageism, or at least prevent its growth (Hewstone 1996   ). Aging Self-Stereotypes Traditionally, "ageism" has been defined in terms of attitudes and actions directed toward older individuals by younger individuals who hold stereotypes about aging. However, research suggests that after a lifetime of exposure to a culture's age stereotypes, older individuals direct these age stereotypes inward.A series of studies has examined how aging self-stereotypes affect older individuals' thinking, behavior, and functioning. In the first study, we found that older Chinese individuals reported more positive stereotypes of aging and performed better on memory tasks than their same-age peers in the United States (Levy and Langer 1994   ). A subliminal age-stereotype priming method was developed for follow-up studies in order to randomly assign participants to either a positive or negative age-stereotype condition while keeping the participants blind to the intervention (Levy 1996   ). Using this method, we have found that older individuals who are exposed to negative age stereotypes tend to demonstrate worse memory performance, self-efficacy, handwriting, and will-to-live (Levy 1996   ; Levy 2000   ; Levy, Ashman, and Dror 1999   ). In contrast, older individuals exposed to positive age stereotypes tend to show positive changes in these same areas.As a consequence of their ability to operate on an implicit level, aging self-stereotypes are not likely to be perceived as a cause of cognitive, behavioral, or health-related outcomes. A health problem, for instance, might be attributed to an inevitable decline associated with old age, rather than to a response triggered by an age stereotype. One area in which this process may occur is how older individuals experience cardiovascular stress. We found that aging self-stereotypes can influence older individuals' cardiovascular function without their awareness. Participants who were subliminally exposed to negative-age stereotypes demonstrated a heightened cardiovascular response to stress, measured by blood pressure and heart rate, as compared with those exposed to positive age stereotypes (Levy et al. 2000   ). The negative age stereotypes acted as direct stressors, whereas the positive age stereotypes helped protect participants from experiencing cardiovascular stress.In these studies, my colleagues and I have tended to explore only one dependent variable at a time. In the real world, it seems likely that implicit self-stereotyping occurs in several spheres at once, and that these effects are mutually reinforcing. For example, if an old person is exposed to a negative age stereotype, this may both impede memory and elevate an individual's stress level. The impaired recall may exacerbate stress, and the elevated stress may further impede memory performance. Conclusion It is important to record acts of ageism that are perpetrated against elderly people, the aim of Dr. Palmore 2001    Ageism Survey, both because these events are injurious in themselves and because they may trigger responses in older individuals without their awareness. When these responses are observed by younger individuals, there is a risk that the observations will confirm negative age stereotypes and, thus, increase the likelihood that ageist acts will be perpetuated.The research on implicit ageism and aging self-stereotypes suggests a need to be concerned about the multiple ways in which negative ageism infiltrates into our own thinking and behaviors. To eradicate ageism we need to become aware of not only the blatant forms of ageism, but also its more subtle forms that operate within us all, regardless of age or explicit views about equality.

     Dr. Palmore replies:I appreciate Elias Cohen's pointing out the "Complex Nature of Ageism" and I agree with most of his comments. However, I would like to clarify a few minor points: My survey does not assume that all jokes about old age are ageist. The item reads, "I was told a joke that pokes fun at old people" (italics added).I think that senior discounts and early bird specials are not reflections of ageism, but simply marketing devices to get more business from seniors (just like other discounts and "sales").The problem of subjective interpretation versus intent of the professional is a common one with other forms of discrimination such as racism and sexism. However, I think the effect of an act that is interpreted as ageism may be the same regardless of intent of the actor.I welcome Becca Levy's excellent comments on my Ageism Survey, "Eradication of Ageism Requires Addressing the Enemy Within." She points out that ageist stereotypes may operate unconsciously both in younger and in older people. However, if the stereotypes are unconscious, it would be difficult to measure them with a simple questionnaire such as the Ageism Survey.Nevertheless, I found her theory that when implicit ageism is operating, the actors are likely to attribute their ageist behavior to "another factor that better fits their preferred self-image as reasonably fair individuals" to be especially cogent.Furthermore, I think the statement that "even if older persons suspect a behavior was influenced by age, they may not want to admit to themselves that they have encountered ageism" may be the best explanation for the 23% of our respondents who denied ever having experienced any ageism.I find the research and insights of Levy and her colleagues to be revealing and significant. I look forward to reading the chapter on "Implicit Ageism" by Levy and Banaji to be published in 2002.            Issue Section:  The Forum         Download all figures             
     Abstract Purpose: The main goal of this study was to determine how well the disability questions of both the 1990 and 2000 Census correlated with a standard measure of disability. If the census questions were to correlate moderately well with a standard measure of disability, then Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and other organizations would be able to use census information in estimating service needs for their catchment (service) area. Design and Methods: Questionnaires containing both the census disability questions and a standard measure of disability were mailed to 4,508 older adults; 1,514 completed surveys were returned. In order to assess reliability, 472 of the respondents who completed the mail survey were reinterviewed by phone. All three disability measures were collapsed into the following three categories: no needs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) needs only, and activities of daily living (ADL) needs. Results: All three disability measures exhibited moderate to good test–retest reliability. Using a standard measure of disability as the criterion, validity for the 1990 Census measure was quite low (Kappas of approximately 0.35). Validity for the 2000 Census measure was moderate to good (Kappas of approximately 0.60). Implications: These results suggest that the 2000 Census disability questions may be sufficiently valid for planning purposes. However, additional research with more representative samples of older adults is needed.   ADL ,  IADL ,  Planning ,  Needs assessment Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDArea Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and other human service agencies have routinely used census information to help them plan services for their catchment area. Census data have provided planners with estimates of the percentage of people in their catchment area who are elderly, live alone, and are poor. However, prior to 1990 there was nothing in the census data that provided planners with any information on respondents' disability level, the single best indicator of service needs of elders (Harlow 1992   ). This forced AAAs and other planning agencies to conduct their own needs assessment studies to assess the disability level of respondents living in their catchment area. Because these agencies typically could not afford to draw large samples, their population estimates of disability usually had a large margin of error. In addition, these studies typically have not been able to estimate service needs for catchment areas any smaller than a county.The 1990 Census contained two disability items. One item asked about the ability of the respondent to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, bathing, and dressing; the other item assessed the ability to perform various instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as the ability to go outside the home to shop or visit the doctor. Somewhat different disability items were included in the 2000 Census.This study investigated the relationship of the 1990 and 2000 Census disability items with a longer criterion measure of disability that is widely used to estimate the functioning level of older adults. If the census disability measures correlate moderately well with the criterion measure of disability, administrators of AAAs and other agencies could rely more heavily on census data in their planning process. Disability information from the census data could be used to estimate the need for home-based services (such as home-delivered meals, housekeeping assistance, and home health care) for catchment areas as small as a census tract.We are aware of only one study that compared the 1990 Census disability items with a standard measure of disability. In that study, Rodgers and Miller 1997    found that the census measure underestimated ADL functioning when compared to a criterion measure. That study did not report on the relationship between the 1990 Census IADL item and the criterion measure. To our knowledge, Andresen, Fitch, McLendon, and Meyers 2000    have conducted the only study that compared the 2000 Census disability measure with a longer criterion measure of disability. Andresen and colleagues reported Kappas of 0.02 to 0.37 between the 3 census disability items and 10 specific ADL questions and concluded that the 2000 Census measure was too inaccurate to be used for estimating disability. However, we believe that the method used by Andresen and colleagues for calculating agreement was too strict. They calculated agreement statistics between the more global census items and each of the specific items from the criterion measure. It is not surprising that the census items that refer to multiple ADLs in a single item did not correlate highly with any specific ADL item on the criterion measure.We believe a more appropriate examination of the validity of the census items would be to create a categorical measure of disability from the criterion that is comparable to the following categories that can be created from the census questions: no need; IADL needs only; and ADL needs with or without an IADL need. Although more categories could be formed from the census questions, these three categories are based on a recognized hierarchy of needs that considers ADL problems more limiting than IADL problems (Ferrucci et al. 1998   ). For planning purposes, this tripartite classification of needs is sufficient because, in general, individuals with ADL problems will have more service needs than individuals who only have IADL problems. Thus, the current study investigated the validity of the 1990 and 2000 Census disability items compared to a criterion measure of disability with all three measures using a tripartite category system for classifying disability. Methods Sample and Procedure We drew our sample from the 1996 voter registration list of St. Louis County, Missouri, because we could identify the age of each member of the population. We were willing to sacrifice some generalizability in order to ensure that each survey was mailed to an eligible participant (i.e., someone over age 65). A random sample of 4,508 older adults, aged 65 or older, was mailed the survey of disability measures. This represented 6.6% of the population of eligible voters in St. Louis County who were over age 65. Twenty-seven surveys (0.6%) were returned as undeliverable or respondent deceased; 1,514 respondents (33.6%) returned a completed survey (846 men and 668 women). Ninety-four percent of the sample were Caucasian.In order to simulate the Content Reinterview Survey used by the Census Bureau for checking the reliability of their data (McNeil 1993   ), 472 of the 1,514 respondents who completed our mail survey were readministered the same instrument via a phone interview within one month of the initial mail survey. In the cover letter sent with the mail survey, all respondents had been informed that they might be recontacted later for a phone interview. We believed it was essential to conduct the phone interviews because McNeil 1993    reported a Kappa of only 0.28 on the 1990 Census ADL item for agreement between mail and phone responses; Kappa for the IADL item was 0.53.A professional survey research firm conducted the phone interviews, and respondents were paid $10 for the interview. The survey research firm had been given a quota of at least 200 interviews with men and 200 interviews with women, with a minimum sample of 450. No other restrictions were placed on them, including the number of required call-backs and such. In 269 cases no interview was completed because of a wrong number, a disconnected phone, or an answering machine. In 315 cases the phone was answered, but the interviewer was unable to talk to the desired respondent. In 204 instances the interview with the desired respondent was begun, but never completed. No calls were made to the other respondents from the mail sample, because the survey research firm had already reached its quota. The final phone sample consisted of 242 men and 230 women.To further simulate the procedures used by the Census Bureau, both the mail and phone survey asked the respondent to answer the questions about the health needs of the oldest person living in his or her household. Because of this request, we had some respondents who answered questions about themselves (self) and some respondents who answered the questions about another person (proxy), usually a spouse. In the mail sample there were 1,140 self-respondents and 374 proxy respondents. In the phone sample there were 345 self-respondents and 127 proxy respondents. Measures 1990 Census Disability Items The 1990 Census disability question had two parts and read as follows: "Because of a health condition that has lasted for 6 or more months, does this person have any difficulty … Going outside the home alone, for example, to shop or visit a doctor's office?Taking care of his or her own personal needs, such as bathing, dressing, or getting around the home?"A "yes" response to part A indicated an IADL problem and a "yes" response to part B indicated an ADL problem. For analysis purposes we created a categorical variable with three levels: no needs, IADL need only, ADL need with or without IADL need. 2000 Census Disability Items. The 2000 Census contained the following disability items: "Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or more, does this person have any difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home?""Does this person have a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying?""Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or more, does this person have difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor's office?"Questions 1 and 3 were similar, but not identical, to the questions used in the 1990 Census. A "yes" response to question 1 indicated an ADL problem. A "yes" response to questions 2 or 3 indicated an IADL problem. For analysis purposes we created a categorical variable with three levels: no needs, IADL need only, ADL need with or without ADL need. Criterion Disability Measure. The criterion measure of disability used in this study was a slightly modified version of the measure used in the National Health Interview Survey (Fitti and Kovar 1987   ). The specific ADL and IADL content areas covered by the items are listed in  Table 1  . The stem for the items reads as follows:"Does the oldest person living in the household have any difficulty doing the following tasks because of a health or physical problem?" Statistical Analyses To determine how well the two census measures of disability correlated with the criterion measure of disability, both Kappa and percent agreement statistics were calculated. Most researchers believe that agreement between measures is overestimated by percent agreement, but underestimated by Kappa, when the sample is unevenly distributed between the categories (Jones, Johnson, Butler, and Main 1983   ). We calculated these agreement statistics for the following subgroups as well as for the total sample: (1) male versus female, (2) under age 75 versus 75 and older, and (3) self versus proxy. Results  Table 1  displays information on the percentage of respondents in the mail sample who reported having difficulty performing any of the tasks on the criterion disability measure. Given that this was a community sample, it is not surprising that most participants reported few difficulties, particularly on the ADL items. Trouble doing heavy housekeeping (28.2%) was the only item for which a significant percentage of respondents reported needing help. This item was eliminated from the calculation of the categorical measure of disability for the criterion measure. We believed that this was justified because AAAs were not likely to consider an older adult who only needed assistance with heavy house cleaning as eligible for publicly funded services. Table 2  displays the contingency tables for the relationship between the 1990 and 2000 Census disability variables as well as the relationship between both the 1990 and 2000 Census disability variables with the criterion measure of disability, scored as categorical variables, for the entire mail sample. Because of missing data, sample size was reduced to 1,377. Kappa for the relationship between the two census measures was 0.45 and the percent agreement was 80%. Most of the disagreement between the 1990 and 2000 Census measures was in the IADL-only category, with the 1990 Census measure only classifying 6% of the sample in this category and the 2000 Census measure classifying 22% of the sample in this category. Given that the 2000 Census measure had an additional IADL item, this is not surprising.Examination of the relationship of 1990 Census measure with the criterion measure reveals that most of the errors (i.e., the off-diagonal values) made by the 1990 measure are underestimates of IADL disability. About 24% of the sample was rated as having an IADL disability using the criterion, but only 6% of the sample was rated as having an IADL disability using the 1990 Census measure. On the other hand, 68% of the sample was classified as having no needs using the criterion measure of disability, but 88% of the sample was classified as having no needs using the 1990 Census measure. Kappa was 0.36 and percent agreement was 75%.The 2000 measure was a significant improvement over the 1990 measure; Kappa was 0.60 and percent agreement was 82% for the relationship between the 2000 Census disability measure and the criterion. Moreover, although the 2000 Census measure still underestimates disability slightly, the errors made using the 2000 measure more evenly distributed between under- and overestimates of disability. Table 3  contains the Kappa and percent agreement statistics for the relationship between the criterion and the 1990 and 2000 Census disability variables for various subgroups. With the exception of the proxy-mail sample, the Kappas for the 1990 Census were low, approximately 0.35. On the other hand, the Kappas for the various subgroups for the 2000 Census were in the moderate range, approximately 0.60. With two exceptions, subgroup differences in Kappa were minimal. Kappas were lower for the phone survey than the mail survey, and Kappas for self-repondents were lower than for proxies. In general, the percent agreement statistics for both the 1990 and 2000 Census ranged between 75% and 85%, with the values for the 2000 Census being higher.Finally, data from the phone sample (i.e., those respondents who completed both the mail survey and the phone interview) were used to estimate the test–retest reliability of the three categorical measures of disability. All three measures exhibited moderate to good reliability: Kappa = 0.53 for the criterion measure, Kappa = 0.59 for the 1990 measure, and Kappa = 0.59 for the 2000 measure. Given that respondents' disability levels could have truly changed in the interval between the return of the mail survey and the phone interview, and given that a different measurement modality was employed (mail vs phone), these reliability coefficients are quite respectable. It is also important to note that there was no significant difference between the mean number of difficulties on the criterion measure as a function of whether the data were collected by mail (mean = 0.96) or by phone (mean = 0.99). Discussion Past and Future Research Consistent with the work of Rodgers and Miller 1997   , this study also found that the 1990 Census disability questions underestimate disability when compared to a standard ADL/IADL measure. In contrast, this study found that the 2000 Census disability items had adequate reliability and validity. This conclusion is at variance with that of Andresen and colleagues 2000   , who used a different approach to measuring agreement. We believe that our approach, which formed comparable categories for both the criterion measure and the census measures, was a more appropriate test of agreement than the approach of Andresen and colleagues, who calculated agreement between the global census questions and specific ADL/IADL items that were not comparable in their scope of inquiry. However, it is important to remind the reader that because the census disability categories are global measures, they do not provide information about specific ADL and IADL needs. If knowledge about functioning on a specific ADL/IADL item is needed, then the broad census disability categories would be inadequate.Clearly, more research is needed with different samples and different criterion measures of disability before a definitive conclusion can be made on the value of census data in planning services for elderly people. Not only should future researchers try to replicate our results, but they should try to expand them by seeing how well the 2000 Census disability variables predict other important variables such as service utilization and service awareness (Calsyn and Roades 1993   ; Calsyn, Roades, and Klinkenberg 1998   ; Wolinsky and Johnson 1991   ). It is also important to find out if the single item on cognitive functioning that was added to the 2000 Census correlates with longer, more widely accepted measures of cognitive functioning. Our study did not include a standard measure of cognitive functioning, so we are unable to make a recommendation with regard to the utility of this new item in planning services for the elderly population. Study Limitations The generalizability of the results of this study are limited by a number of factors. First, our sample only included registered voters, primarily Caucasian, from one urban county of the Midwest. Moreover, only about a third of the sample returned our mail questionnaire. Thus, our results may not generalize to other samples, particularly minority elders, frail elders, and those older adults who may be less conscientious in returning surveys. Similarly, because our protocol for the phone sample did not require interviewers to contact specific respondents, the phone sample may have underrepresented older adults with hearing problems and more frail elders who are less likely to answer the phone. In addition, the most active older adults may also have been underrepresented in our phone sample because they were less likely to be at home when called.Second, although we tried to simulate the procedures used by the Census Bureau in conducting both the mail survey and the phone interview, we cannot know with any certainty whether our data collection procedures were more or less reliable than the census procedures. One could speculate that our procedures might produce somewhat more reliable data because our instruments only focused on disability information, whereas the census instruments asked about a wider range of issues. Third, we used only one criterion measure of disability. Rodgers and Miller 1997    have shown that different measures of disability used in various national samples have produced different estimates of the number of respondents who are disabled. Thus, the results of our study might have been somewhat different if we had chosen a different criterion measure of disability. Implications for Service Planning The data from the phone sample indicated that the 1990 and 2000 Census measures had moderate to good reliability, equal to that of the longer criterion measure of disability. With regard to validity, the 2000 Census measure of disability was clearly superior to the 1990 Census measure. We believe that both the percent agreement and Kappa values for the relationship between the 2000 disability measure and the criterion measure of disability were high enough in this study that AAAs and other planning groups should consider using the 2000 Census disability data for estimating service needs in their catchment area. Even though the 2000 disability measure slightly underestimates disability, and it is not as accurate as more conventional ADL/IADL measures, the ability of the 2000 Census data to provide estimates of disability for small geographic areas far outweighs the loss of precision. Because the disability items only appear on the "long form," estimates of disability for areas smaller than census tracts will probably have large standard errors. However, this is a vast improvement over the typical needs assessment, which can only provide estimates of need for large geographic areas such as counties. In addition, the vast array of other information in the census files allows planners to make separate estimates of disability for various subgroups of elders, categorized according to dimensions including the following: age, race, income, and living situation.Planners should also consider using one of the sophisticated computer programs that are now available for analyzing census data (e.g., ARCVIEW 2000   ; GeoStats 2000   ). Using this type of computer software would allow planners to create maps based on census information that could pinpoint those areas within an agency's catchment area that had: (1) the highest need for assistance with ADL/IADL needs; (2) the highest poverty levels; (3) the highest percentage of elders living alone, and such. Technical assistance in using this software is usually available from most major universities, because university researchers in many fields are now doing research using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Most of the Census 2000 data that planners would want should be available in Summary File 3, which is scheduled for release in the summer of 2002.Despite our enthusiasm for the utility of the 2000 Census for planning services for elders, it is important to note the limitations of census data. First, the utility of the 2000 Census for planning purposes will dissipate over time, particularly for those geographic areas that experience a greater migration of inhabitants. Also, because the census disability categories only classify respondents as having ADL or IADL needs, agency planners cannot glean from the census data the specific ADLs and IADLs for which their older adult population needs assistance. In addition, the census disability questions only measure intrinsic disability (i.e., the ability of the individual to perform the activity without assistance). Consequently, service planners cannot obtain any information from census data on residual disability (i.e., the ability of an individual to perform an activity with assistance from equipment or another individual), which is also important in planning services (Freedman 2000   ). Finally, the census data provide no information regarding the following issues, which are important in planning services for the elderly population: service awareness, prior service utilization, and perceived barriers to receiving services. Thus, census data cannot totally replace conventional needs assessment studies. Nevertheless, the 2000 Census does provide AAAs and others with meaningful information on disability levels and other social indicators that describe the older adults living in their catchment area.

     Abstract Purpose: This study explored factors that are related to the level of contact (number of visits and calls) between newly admitted nursing home residents and their family and friends. In addition to reexamining factors studied previously, several new factors were explored: contact level prior to nursing home placement, dementia status, and resident race. Design and Methods: Interviews were conducted with the significant others of 1,441 residents from a representative sample of nursing homes in Maryland. Results: Contact decreased by approximately half following admission, compared to reported preadmission contact. Rates of contact are positively related to nonuse of Medicaid, kinship closeness, support network proximity, nondemented status, and White race. After controlling for preadmission contact, postadmission contact is positively associated with kinship closeness, support network proximity, nondemented status, and White race. Implications: The study identifies factors that are useful to consider when designing interventions to increase family involvement with nursing home residents.   Family involvement ,  Long-term care ,  Dementia ,  Caregiving Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDUnderstanding family caregiving to frail elders is a large and growing area within gerontology; however, the attention paid to caregivers has generally ended at the nursing home door. Consequently, little is known about family caregiving to the 1.5 million persons aged 65 and older currently residing in nursing homes in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999   ). This gap in understanding is unfortunate because family involvement has the potential to positively influence the nursing home setting through improved psychosocial well-being of residents (Greene and Monahan 1982   ), reduced care burden of staff, and increased public involvement in the concerns of America's enlarging elderly population. With better information about factors that inhibit or facilitate involvement, interventions may be feasible.Part of the reason for the lapse in research focus may be the longstanding misconception that nursing home residents are abandoned by relatives. In fact, family members and friends stay in contact, retain close emotional ties, and continue to contribute to basic care needs of residents (see Naleppa 1996   , for a review). Most families live within 30 miles of their institutionalized relative and within a median traveling distance of 10 miles (Greene and Monahan 1982   ; Hook, Sobal, and Oak 1982   ; Montgomery 1982   ). Findings regarding visitation frequency have been remarkably consistent, with at least weekly visitation for the majority (approximately 60%) of residents (Bitzan and Kruzich 1990   ; Hook et al. 1982   ; National Center for Health Statistics 1979   ). Nonetheless, large numbers of nursing home residents receive less frequent visits. In one study, 16% received no visits by family and 40% received no visits from friends (Bitzan and Kruzich 1990   ).A handful of factors have been examined in relation to the disparity in contact levels of nursing home residents. Contact is greater for residents whose care is funded by family resources (Geib 1980   ). Contact also increases with proximity. As geographic distance of the nursing home to a family caregiver decreases, visitation increases (Bitzan and Kruzich 1990   ). Those with children living within an hour's drive receive more visits (Hook et al. 1982   ). Another study found that for each doubling of distance between the nearest direct relative and the nursing home, visitation declined by about half (Greene and Monahan 1982   ). Kinship status also is important: more visits are received by persons who are married (Hook et al. 1982   ; National Center for Health Statistics 1979   ). Residents with greater impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) receive more visits (Greene and Monahan 1982   ). No impact on contact level has been found for visitor gender, education, or retirement status, nor for the age of the resident (Hook et al. 1982   ). The relationship of the duration of stay in the nursing home to contact is unclear. Some studies have found little change over time (Greene and Monahan 1982   ; Spasoff et al. 1978   ), others have found decreased contact with increased length of stay (Hook et al. 1982   ), and others have arrived at mixed results depending on whether the visitors are family members (decreased visits) or friends (no change; Bitzan and Kruzich 1990   ).These findings begin to describe which residents receive greater contact from family and friends, but at least three potentially important factors have yet to be examined: dementia status, race, and preadmission visitation. Little is known about the relationship between contact level and the cognitive health of the resident. Family and friends may mobilize around demented elders, feeling a responsibility to more closely monitor care and provide a connection to the resident's past. Alternatively, visiting someone with dementia may be less personally rewarding, or more emotionally distressing, leading to reduced contact. Cognitively impaired residents can lose the ability to participate in certain forms of contact, such as phone calls and written communication.Race/ethnicity has been shown to be related to nursing home admission rates, with lower use of institutional care by older African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans as compared to Caucasians (Damron-Rodriguez, Wallace, and Kington 1994   ; Falcone and Broyles 1994   ). The larger social support networks available to elderly Blacks (Gibson 1982   ; Gibson and Jackson 1987   ; Thornton, White-Means, and Choi 1993   ) may be providing care longer and thus delaying or avoiding institutionalization. Other possible explanations for the reduced use of formal long-term care services among Blacks may include socioeconomic disadvantage, decreased access to long- term care, and racial discrimination. Considering that nursing home admission rates differ by race, it may be useful to examine nursing home contact levels by race as well.Preadmission contact is another largely overlooked but potentially important component of postadmission contact. Family and friends who are highly involved prior to placement may be more likely to remain so after placement. An early study suggests that telephone contact prior to placement is weakly but positively related to later nursing home visits (York and Caslyn 1977   ).Methodological limitations are evident in the existing literature on family involvement in the nursing home. Nursing home contact is generally measured as the number of in-person visits received by a resident. However, more distant relatives may utilize other forms of communication such as telephone calls. Contact has also been traditionally measured as the visitation of a single primary significant other. This approach underestimates contact levels for residents whose social support is shared across a network of family and friends. In one study, more than three quarters of nursing home visits were by groups of persons (Hook et al. 1982   ). A fuller understanding of family involvement should encompass how many persons maintain contact with a nursing home resident via in-person visits or telephone calls.The existing literature also has limited generalizability to today's nursing home populations. Most studies relied on small and nonrepresentative samples from rural areas, often selected from a limited number and type of nursing homes. These studies either include no information about participants' race or indicate that the sample was essentially all-White. Residents were sometimes excluded on the basis of illness and impaired cognition. Moreover, most of the studies were published more than 15 years ago. Given the increasing age and acuity of today's nursing home residents, both the residents and their social networks may be different now.The current study addressed these limitations in several ways. Reports of in-person visits and telephone calls were combined to create a more comprehensive measure of contact. Visits and phone calls from spouses, siblings, children, other relatives, and friends/neighbors were considered separately to obtain a more complete picture of the contact patterns of the resident's entire social network. The study utilized a large and representative sample. In addition to reexamining several of the factors shown in previous studies to affect visitation rates, the current study also examined preadmission contact levels and resident dementia status and race. Finally, we conducted an analysis examining the relative contributions of these factors to postadmission contact levels while controlling for preadmission contact levels.Based on previous research, we hypothesized the following. Higher levels of postadmission contact would be positively related to non-Medicaid payment status, closer kinship status, a greater number of family and friends in geographic proximity to the nursing home, and a higher number of ADL dependencies. We expected that residents with dementia would have less contact with family and friends. We also hypothesized that Black nursing home residents would receive higher contact levels than would White residents. Finally, we expected contact levels prior to admission to be positively correlated with postadmission contact levels. Methods Participants and Procedure Subjects were interviewed as part of the Maryland Long-Term Care Project (LTCP), a program of research dedicated to studying quality of life among persons residing in long-term care settings (Magaziner et al. 2000   ). Study participants were the significant others (as identified by staff) of nursing home residents enrolled in the LTCP. Nursing homes were identified and residents were enrolled as follows. All 221 licensed long-term care facilities in Maryland were categorized by location and number of beds, and a stratified random sample of 64 homes was selected. Four (6%) homes did not participate and one had no eligible residents. The 59 homes providing data represented a 27% sample of all Maryland nursing facilities and included rural, urban, and suburban homes as well as a range of nursing home sizes. All residents newly admitted from September 1992 through March 1995 aged 65 years and older who had not resided in a nursing home in the previous year (for more than 8 days) were eligible. Seventy percent of the 3,851 eligible residents were enrolled, for a total of 2,285. Most residents were female (70.9%), the average age was 81.5 years, 80.5% (1,837) were White, 15.7% were Black, 0.9% were Hispanic, and 2.8% were described as "other." These demographics are comparable to national figures (Magaziner et al. 2000   ; Strahan 1997   ). Efforts were made to interview one significant other per resident over the telephone or in person; 2,112 were interviewed.Only interviews with family members and friends (excluding guardians and paid helpers) 18 years or older that had taken place at least 2 weeks (14 days) after the resident's admission to the nursing home (for at least a 15-day stay) were included in the current sample (N = 1,441). Guardians and paid helpers (n = 73) were excluded out of concern that they would be unfamiliar with the contact patterns of the resident's family and friends. Of the significant others included in the present analyses, most were female (n = 979; 67.9%) and White (n = 1,211; 84%). They had a mean age of 57.4 years (range 25–98; SD = 12.6), 13.6 years of education (range 0–20; SD = 3.1), and were interviewed an average of 34.3 days following the resident's admission (range 15–65; SD = 13.0). The significant others had known the patient an average of 51 years (range 2–90; SD = 14.2). The largest group was daughters (36.3%), followed by sons (20.9%), spouses (12.8%), nieces and daughters-in-law (5.5% and 5.3%, respectively), granddaughters and sisters (3.3% each), and friends and neighbors (3.2%). The remainder was made up of other family relationships. Resident characteristics for the final sample were very similar to the full sample: average age 81.7 years (range 65–99; SD = 7.6), 72.2% female, and 81% (n = 1,167) White. Of non-Whites in the sample, 15% (n = 216) were Black, 1.1% (n = 16) were Hispanic, and 2.9% (n = 42) were "other." For this reason, only White versus Black comparisons were conducted in the regression analysis, excluding the Hispanic and "other" categories. Variables Network Proximity. A count of the number of persons living within a one-hour drive of the nursing home was obtained for five categories of persons: spouse, siblings, children, other relatives, and friends/neighbors (postadmission network proximity). For example, for each category, respondents were asked, "How many (brothers/sisters) live within a one-hour drive of the nursing home?" Significant others were also asked how many miles the nursing home was from the resident's nearest family member or friend (nearest loved one), how many miles the nursing home was from the home in which the resident lived prior to admission (geographic relocation), and how many relatives lived within a one-hour drive of the resident prior to admission, including those living with the resident (preadmission network proximity). Contact. Contact was defined as the number of days in a defined 2-week period that a resident was visited or telephoned by specific categories of persons. Preadmission contact was the total number of visits and calls by four categories of persons who did not live with the resident: siblings, children, other relatives, and friends/neighbors. Persons living in the same household with the resident were automatically assigned daily contact for visits. For postadmission contact, information was obtained regarding five categories of persons: spouse, siblings, children, other relatives, and friends/neighbors. Preadmission contact covered the 2 weeks before the resident was admitted to the nursing home. Postadmission contact referred to the 2 weeks preceding the interview with the significant other. Medicaid Status. Residents whose stay in the nursing home was funded in some part by Medicaid received a 1 for this variable, while all others received a 0. Data were obtained from the Minimum Data Set (MDS; Morris et al. 1990   ) upon admission. Number of ADL Dependencies. Current physical functioning was rated by nursing home staff with a modified version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (Katz, Ford, and Moskowitz 1963   ). The scale was derived from 14 items in the Psychogeriatric Dependency Rating Scale (PGDRS; Wilkinson and Graham-White 1980   ) on six domains: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, feeding, and continence. Each Katz domain was scored dichotomously as any dependency versus fully independent. A summary Katz score was created by adding the number of dependent domains; higher scores are indicative of more dependence. Kinship Status. Residents whose significant other was a first-degree family member (sibling, child, parent, or spouse) were assigned a 1 for Kinship status. Residents whose significant other was not a first-degree relative were assigned a 0. Dementia Status. Dementia status was determined in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised (American Psychiatric Association 1987   ) by an expert panel of geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, and a geriatrician using information collected from interviews with residents, nursing staff, significant others, and medical records. A detailed description of the dementia ascertainment methodology may be found elsewhere (Magaziner et al. 1996   ). For the present analyses, residents with dementia were assigned a 1, and those determined not to have dementia (or whose dementia status could not be determined conclusively) were assigned a 0. Results Descriptive Data for Primary Study Variables  Table 1  provides descriptive information about residents and significant others. On average, nursing home residents lived less than 15 miles from a significant other. Mean relocation following placement was less than 20 miles. The mean number of ADL skills in which the resident was dependent was close to four. The number of family members and friends living within an hour's drive did not change following the resident's placement; the median number both pre- and postadmission was 7. The mean number of contacts by family members and friends who visited, called, or lived with the resident in the 2-week period prior to placement (37.8) compared to the mean number of contacts during the 2-week period preceding the significant other interview (19.9) decreased by approximately half. The median number of contacts decreased from 33 prior to placement to 17 following placement. The mean number of visits dropped by 45% following admission; the mean number of phone calls dropped by 56%.The primary significant other was a first-degree relative for 1,087 (75.4%) of the residents. A total of 315 (23.2%) of the residents utilized Medicaid at admission. Approximately half (53.9%, n = 776) of the residents had dementia. Relationship to Postadmission Contact Hypotheses regarding the relationships between contact and the primary study variables were examined via correlations for continuous variables and t tests for categorical variables.  Table 2  shows the correlations. Contrary to prediction, the number of ADL dependencies was not significantly correlated with postadmission contact. As predicted, preadmission contact was significantly positively correlated with postadmission contact (r = .35, p < .001), indicating that residents whose social networks offered high levels of contact prior to admission received more visits and phone calls than residents whose social networks provided lower contact prior to admission. Postadmission network proximity was also positively correlated with post-admission contact (r = .23, p < .001); residents with a larger number of relatives and friends living within a one-hour drive of the nursing home had higher levels of contact.Also as predicted, t tests indicated that residents whose stay was paid at least in part by Medicaid received less contact (M = 16.8, SD = 13.4) than those who were not covered by Medicaid (M = 20.7, SD = 14.8), t(1350) = 4.14, p < .001; residents whose primary visitor was a first-degree relative had higher contact levels (M = 21.2, SD = 15.2) than those whose primary visitor was not a first-degree relative (M = 15.9, SD = 12.1), t(1430) = –6.01, p < .001; and residents with dementia had less contact (M = 17.3, SD = 12.5) than those not meeting criteria for dementia (M = 22.9, SD = 16.4), t(1430) = –7.30, p < .001). Finally, and contrary to expectations, White residents had more contact (M = 20.5, SD = 14.3) than did Black residents (M = 16.2, SD = 14.9), t(1372) = 4.04, p < .001. Dementia Status and Race In an effort to better understand differences in contact levels by dementia status and race, we examined relationships between these variables and the remaining primary study variables. Dementia Status. Residents with dementia were different from those without dementia in several ways. Chi-square tests showed that demented residents were significantly more likely to have some part of their care paid for by Medicaid (p < .001; 17.4% for those without dementia and 28% for those with dementia). A series of t tests showed that demented residents were more dependent in ADLs (M = 4.3, SD = 1.7) than nondemented residents (M = 3.3, SD = 2.0) t(1236) = 9.29, p < .001; had fewer relatives and friends living within a one-hour drive of their home (M = 10.3, SD = 14.4) than nondemented residents (M = 12.0, SD = 17.6), t(1438) = –2.00, p < .05; and had fewer relatives and friends living within a one-hour drive of the nursing home (M = 10.2, SD = 13.7) than nondemented residents (M = 11.9, SD = 17.1), t(1436) = –2.06, p < .05. Residents with and without dementia did not differ statistically in terms of kinship status or amount of contact prior to nursing home admission. Race. Black and White residents also differed from each other in important ways. First, 51.1% (n = 596) of White residents and 68.5% (n = 148) of Black residents met criteria for dementia (p < .001). Second, whereas 77.8% (n = 908) of significant others of White residents were a direct relative, this was the case for 60.2% (n = 130) of Black residents (p < .001). Third, whereas 18% (n = 197) of White residents utilized Medicaid to finance some part of their nursing home care, 49.3% (n = 103) of Black residents did so (p < .001). A t test also demonstrated that Blacks had more ADL dependencies (M = 4.3, SD = 1.8) than Whites (M = 3.8, SD = 1.9), t(1191) = 3.46, p < .01. However, Blacks had a greater number of persons living within an hour of their home before admission (M = 14.2, SD = 25.9) than did Whites (M = 10.5, SD = 13.6), t(1380) = 3.06, p < .01; a greater number of persons living within an hour of the nursing home (M = 14.1, SD = 24.7) than did Whites (M = 10.4, SD = 13.2), t(1378) = 3.20, p < .01; and a greater amount of contact prior to nursing home admission (M = 42.6, SD = 28.1) than did Whites (M = 36.7, SD = 22.5), t(1375) = 3.35, p < .01). Predictors of Postadmission Contact Controlling for Preadmission Contact Regression models were used to explore the relative contributions of resident and significant other characteristics to postadmission contact levels. In the first model, preadmission contact was regressed onto postadmission contact. In the second model, variables previously found to be related to postadmission contact were entered: Medicaid status, kinship status, postadmission network proximity, and the number of the resident's ADL dependencies. In the final model, two new variables examined in this study were entered, namely, dementia status and race (White vs Black). Results of the regression modeling are shown in  Table 3  .In the first model, preadmission contact accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in postadmission contact. In the second model, after controlling for preadmission contact, variables shown in previous studies to be related to contact also contributed significantly to the prediction of postadmission contact. Both Medicaid status and ADL dependencies were significant contributors, with Medicaid status and greater ADL dependency predicting reduced contact. Kinship status and postadmission network proximity were also significant predictors of postadmission contact. Specifically, residents whose significant other was a first-degree relative and residents with a larger social network living within an hour's drive of the nursing home experienced more postadmission contact. In the third and final step, two of the new variables examined in this study, dementia status and race, also contributed significantly to the prediction of postadmission contact. Results of the regression model were virtually identical when the MDS cognitive score was utilized in place of the dichotomous dementia status variable: adjusted R2 = .13 for Step 1; Δ adjusted R2 = .06 for Step 2 (p < .001); Δ adjusted R2 = .03 for Step 3 (p < .001). Both being demented and being Black were associated with less postadmission contact. Moreover, after including dementia status and race in the model, neither Medicaid status nor greater ADL impairment was significant, although Medicaid status approached significance. In terms of their relative contributions to the prediction of postadmission contact in the final regression equation, postadmission network proximity and dementia status followed preadmission contact in importance, followed by kinship status and race. The total amount of variance in postadmission contact accounted for by the final model was modest at 21%. Discussion This study examined factors related to the level of contact between nursing home residents and their family and friends. In addition to reexamining variables previously shown to be related to contact, three new variables were examined, and the relative contributions of the study variables in predicting postadmission contact while controlling for preadmission contact were analyzed. The study is unique with regard to the size and representativeness of the sample, the expanded definition of contact, and the inclusion of the resident's larger social network.With one exception, our results confirmed previous findings. Residents receiving Medicaid assistance had less contact with family and friends. Greater monetary resources may facilitate contact in several ways; for example, family members of higher socioeconomic status may experience fewer practical barriers to visitation and phone calls. Residents whose primary significant other was a first-degree relative also had higher contact levels. Stronger emotional bonds and/or greater sense of familial duty likely exist between closely related family members as opposed to those more distantly related, or those related only by marriage.The number of family and friends living in close proximity to the nursing home was also related to more contact. Although network proximity is a measure of access to family and friends, it is also an estimate of the social network size of the resident. Most likely both the nearness and sheer number of family and friends relate positively to contact levels. Studies that specifically measure the impact of social network size on contact levels would be informative in this regard.One finding from previous research was not borne out in our study; ADL dependencies were not correlated with postadmission contact. In the regression analysis, ADL dependencies lost significance when dementia status and race were considered. This finding is perhaps not surprising considering that ADL dependencies are higher among demented elders than among the nondemented, and being nondemented was a strong predictor of postadmission contact.Dementia status has not previously been studied in relation to family contact patterns, despite its obvious relevance to nursing home populations. This study found that residents with dementia receive less attention from family and friends. Demented residents were also more likely to utilize Medicaid and to have fewer family and friends living nearby. Their frequency of contact prior to admission and their likelihood of having a first-degree relative as a primary significant other did not differ from nondemented residents, however. These results suggest that residents with dementia begin with a smaller available social network than that of the nondemented and also suffer greater decreases in contact, perhaps related to financial barriers.Interpersonal issues, though not examined here, may also lead to decreased contact for residents with dementia. The study by York and Caslyn 1977    found enjoyment of visits decreased as resident self-care ability, cognitive functioning, and personal appearance declined. Moreover, families reported greater difficulty coping with mental deterioration (37%) than with physical disabilities (15%). Resident cognitive impairment was also shown to be related to poorer nursing care and reduced staff awareness of medical problems (Fleishman, Rosin, Tomer, and Schwartz 1987   ). This disturbing finding may relate to the resident's reduced ability to direct his or her care, but may also reflect a lack of involved family members to advocate on the resident's behalf. Research is needed on the reactions of family and friends to the illness and impairment of nursing home residents and how this relates to contact levels.Another variable examined in the current study for the first time is race. Black residents were hypothesized to have greater contact from family and friends than Whites, but this was not the case. Black residents did have greater contact than Whites prior to admission and, as seen in other studies, Black family networks were larger in size and more diverse in terms of kinship than those of Whites (Burton et al. 1995   ; Gibson 1982   ; Gibson and Jackson 1987   ; Thornton et al. 1993   ). The finding of reduced contact following admission therefore suggests that barriers to the continuation of contact may be greater for Blacks than for Whites. One barrier may be lower family resources, as Black residents were significantly more likely to utilize Medicaid than were White residents. Lower socioeconomic status may translate into greater work obligations that diminish opportunities to visit during facility visiting hours, difficulty paying for transportation and telephone costs, and many other practical barriers. Black residents were also more dependent in ADLs and more likely to have dementia than White residents, both of which have been documented previously among nursing home residents (Engle and Graney 1995   ). This suggests that the residents may have been cared for in the community for a longer time and only brought to a nursing home when the family's ability to continue care had diminished. Finally, Black residents were less likely to have a first-degree relative as a primary significant other. Burton and colleagues 1995   , noting racial differences in support systems for elders, point out that little is known about the stability of more diverse family systems over time. Variables not examined in the current study, but which might also pertain to Black elders and their families, include the overall health of the social network, additional filial duties, and cultural differences such as level of comfort in visiting a nursing home. Research focused on barriers to visitation that differentially affect Black families is needed.Perhaps the most striking finding of the present study is that, although families tend to live quite close to their loved one in a nursing home, contact via in-person visits and telephone calls dropped by approximately half within the first few weeks and months of placement. Although this does not indicate that families are no longer involved in care (residents received visits or calls from 20 persons per 2-week period on average), the decline is striking. Some drop in contact would be expected as persons who lived in the same household with the resident prior to admission (and were automatically coded as having a daily visitation contact rate) must now go to the home to visit. However, drops in contact are similar for visits and phone calls. Postadmission contact was not related to the distance the resident moved when admitted to a nursing home; however, residents generally moved very short distances from home. To our knowledge, this study is the first to closely examine change in the amount of family involvement from pre- to postadmission.This study also provides one of the most complete explorations to date of how previous family habits and demographic, health, and socioeconomic factors relate to contact after admission. Preadmission contact accounted for the largest portion of variance in explaining postadmission contact, with higher preadmission contact positively related to postadmission contact. The longstanding contact patterns of an individual's social network are clearly important to keep in mind when evaluating patterns of contact after admission. Other variables of importance are the proximity of family and friends, kinship status of the primary significant other, dementia status, and race. Nevertheless, the overall variance accounted for by the regression equation is modest (approximately 21%), indicating that much more has yet to be learned about families and nursing home contact. Other variables to consider include (a) the health of the resident's social network, (b) the extent of additional time constraints such as employment and other caregiving obligations, (c) transportation and other practical barriers, (d) the quality of the personal relationship between the resident and his or her support system, (e) the quality of the personal relationships between members of the resident's support system, and (f) characteristics that make the nursing home facility a welcoming setting for maintaining involvement.Although addressing many shortcomings of the existing literature, the current study also has limitations, most importantly the short length of nursing home stay, the use of newly admitted residents only, and the use of reports of contact frequency from significant others. Length of stay has not been conclusively found to be associated with a decrease in contact, but longitudinal studies are needed to assess change over longer time periods. Because our study included only newly admitted residents, we must be cautious in interpreting the results. Contact patterns may change to a greater degree at times of transition, such as just prior to and just after nursing home admission. On the other hand, the use of new admissions was valuable in that it facilitated more accurate recollections of preadmission contact levels. Given the social expectation that contact levels be high, it is possible that the reports from significant others used here were inflated. Unfortunately, no clearly superior alternative exists for measuring contact levels. Staff reports also entail biases and inaccuracies, and direct observation to count all of the visits and phone calls received by a resident would be logistically very difficult. Because there is no reason to suppose that some population groups would be more likely than others to inflate contact rates, biases that exist would tend toward the null.Study results have implications for the design of interventions to improve family involvement in the nursing home. Preadmission contact would clearly be difficult to alter. Likewise, neither increasing the number of persons within a resident's support network nor increasing the likelihood that a primary significant other is a first-degree relative are feasible. While one can recommend that elders be placed in nursing homes that are near to their support networks, it appears from this study that this goal is already being accomplished. An approach with more potential for improvement may be to target residents with dementia. Loved ones may need more information about dementia in order to increase their comfort level while visiting a cognitively impaired resident. Such an intervention could also emphasize the critical need for family and friends to advocate on behalf of a person with dementia as his or her own ability to do so lessens. Socioeconomic factors may also be amenable to intervention. For example, transportation barriers may be ameliorated through volunteer ride systems; less flexible work schedules may be accommodated through longer visiting hours, and addressing the psychiatric and health needs of significant others may improve their ability to be involved in the nursing home. There is currently insufficient information regarding the salience of these barriers or what steps would be effective in reducing their negative effect on contact levels.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: State variation in inclusion of ancillary services in daily Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates, versus covering ancillary costs outside of such rates, makes rate comparisons difficult. The purpose of this study is to adjust for inclusion of ancillaries when comparing Medicaid rates across states. Design and Methods: Data for 1987–1998 were drawn from a national survey of Medicaid reimbursement. Employing a random-effects model, the PANEL option in the LIMDEP software was used to estimate effects on state average Medicaid nursing facility constant-dollar rates of the inclusion in those rates of a set of ancillaries: physical therapy, occupational therapy, prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, durable medical equipment (DME), medical supplies, and physician services. Results: Rates averaged higher when they included occupational therapy, physician services, nonprescription drugs, and both DME and medical supplies. Adjusting for the inclusion of ancillaries leads to a much different ranking of states than for unadjusted rates. Implications: Public and industry policy makers should consider the inclusion of ancillaries in rates when considering the relative adequacy of rates across states.   Medicaid ,  Nursing facility ,  Ancillary services Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDMedicaid nursing home expenditures have recently grown at a slower rate than in the past (Levit et al., 2000), and well below the average growth for national health expenditures; but expenditures are large enough to give policy makers ample reason for concern (Coleman 1996   ). Nursing home expenditures were $87.8 billion in 1998, and these were expected to grow to $148.3 billion in 2007 (Levit et al., 2000). Medicaid covered 46% of nursing facility payment in 1998, for 60 to 65% of residents (HCFA 2000a   ; Levit et al., 2000; Short, Feinleib, and Cunningham 1994   ).Medicaid nursing home reimbursement methods and per diem reimbursement rates are of great importance in part because they influence the costs of providing care (Harrington and Swan 1987   ). However, these policies serve goals beyond cost constraint: equitable payment to providers, access for Medicaid eligibles, and quality of care received. Concern is heightened because of the myriad of ways in which these goals may conflict (Gertler 1991   ; Holahan and Sulvetta 1989   ; Swan, Harrington, and Grant 1988   ; Swan, Harrington, Grant, Leuhrs, and Preston 1993   ). Of particular concern is the issue of adequate payment, that which is adequate to promote access and cover the costs of higher quality care. Medicaid reimbursement rates were on average substantially below Medicare nursing home reimbursement, which was $301 per day in 1997 (American Health Care Association 1999   ) compared with only $95.09 for Medicaid (Swan et al. 2000   ), although it should be noted that the Medicare data include much payment to hospital-based facilities, which are more expensive.A new Institute of Medicine report (Wunderlich and Kohler 2000   ) raised concerns about whether state Medicaid reimbursement rates are adequate to ensure high quality of nursing home care. The report pointed to the quality of care problems in many nursing homes and the inadequate staffing levels and urged new research on the relationship between reimbursement rates, access, and quality. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA 2000b   ) also reported serious understaffing in nursing homes throughout the United States, which was found to be related to poor quality of care. State legislators have also been interested in comparing their Medicaid reimbursement rates with other states and some have made new efforts to increase rates in order to improve staffing levels. For example, a 1999 survey of states found that seven states implemented wage pass-throughs for nursing home workers in their 1999 Medicaid reimbursement rates (HCFA 2000b   ).Nursing facilities depend highly on Medicaid as a payer (Levit et al., 2000). They additionally rely on state Medicaid programs to pay rates adequate to cover costs of care (Batavia, Ozminkowski, Gaumer and Gabay 1993   ; Reid and Coburn 1996   ; Stone and Reublinger 1995   ). Because of impacts on access and quality, Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement policies are of intense interest to the consumer and consumer advocacy groups (Sparer 1993   ; U.S. General Accounting Office 1995   ). Whatever their relative interest in these varied goals, policy makers are understandably concerned with the wide variation across states in per diem rates, particularly because the ratio of the highest average state rate has been four and six times higher than the lowest average state rate every year for over two decades (Swan et al. 2000   ).Comparison of rates is made complex, however, by such factors as interstate differences in what is included in daily rates. States vary widely in whether they include various ancillary services and commodities in daily rates versus covering the costs of such ancillaries outside of the rates (Swan et al. 2000   ). This study focuses on the question of whether ancillaries are included in the Medicaid nursing facility per diem rate and how ancillaries influence the interstate comparison of such rates. It does not attempt to establish overall costs for a day of care, which would necessitate different estimation techniques and consideration of additional elements beyond the list of ancillaries considered here. Background Cost accounting for ancillary services and products is difficult enough in itself, for example where payers reimburse separately for ancillaries (Healthcare Financial Management 1998   ; Sutter and Keough 1999   ). Average costs of providing a given type of ancillary (e.g., physical therapy) may vary considerably across facilities and providers, depending particularly on both volume and intensity of use of the ancillary (Sutter and Keough 1999   ). Thus, although some types of providers (e.g., hospitals) may fare quite well in being separately reimbursed for the provision of ancillaries (Larkin 1999   ; Pretzer 1999   ), nursing facilities may not do so well. For example, low reimbursement is a reason physicians are reluctant to provide care in nursing facilities to their patients who are residents, even though regular monitoring by physicians has the potential for improving the quality of required resident assessments (McCartney and McCartney 1997   ).Ancillary services are important to nursing facility care. "Ancillary" is defined as "being auxiliary or supplementary" (Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary, 1997). An ancillary service for nursing facility care is any service considered auxiliary or supplementary to nursing care. Such ancillaries include various therapies, drugs, supplies, and equipment (The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 1999), and an array of other items. Each state can have its own list of ancillaries, and searches have not dislodged any HCFA designation. The list used here resulted from researchers' (Swan et al. 1988   ) presenting a list of seven ancillaries found to be commonly referenced in state Medicaid reimbursement policies.When ancillaries are included in rates, however, there can be considerably greater variation, combined with no assurance that average costs are even considered. This is particularly true in recent years in the Medicaid program, where concerns with constraining costs may outweigh concerns with adequately paying for each type of care (Swan and Pickard in press   ).Policies to include ancillaries in rates have effects other than cost. In particular, including ancillaries in rates may be a disincentive to provision of the ancillaries, because a facility receives no additional revenue from providing a given ancillary already included in its daily rate. This is of particular concern because of the relatively low rate of provision of such ancillaries as rehabilitative therapies in the United States compared to other countries (Berg et al. 1997   ). Likewise, policies related to reimbursement of prescription drugs, and their influence on actual use of drugs in nursing facilities, are important. This is of concern especially in light of the estimates that the costs in morbidity and mortality associated with drug treatment in nursing facilities may outweigh the actual costs of drug treatment (Bootman, Harrison, and Cox 1997   ). Few studies have examined ancillary rate policies and their effects on nursing homes.Although there are wider implications of reimbursement policies for ancillaries, the focus here remains on the implications for reimbursement systems. The question is how inclusion of ancillaries in the per diem nursing facility rate influences the interstate comparison of such rates. This approach cannot hope to account for the costs of the ancillaries, instead focusing on evidence of presumed state adjustment of rates to cover such costs. Methods A variety of approaches might be used to value the costs of ancillaries. The experience collecting survey data from states suggests that most are unable to provide average costs for major cost centers, much less for specific ancillaries. Although costs of ancillaries might be sought in facility cost reports (Swan and Pickard 2001   ), the contents of cost reports vary widely and seldom contain the wealth of detail that would allow the costing of specific ancillaries. Consequently, the approach used here is to attempt to model the costs of ancillaries through the use of panel regression analysis over a multiyear period, with appropriate adjustment for correlated error over time.Data for a 12-year period, 1987–1998, were drawn from a series of national surveys of Medicaid long-term care reimbursement. The reimbursement rate data were collected from a series of telephone surveys conducted between 1983 and 1999 to collect data from 1987–1998 on Medicaid long-term care payment methods. A combination of telephone interviewing and mail surveys elicited information to clarify responses. The data in this study are collected at the end of the state fiscal year to represent actual reimbursement rates for the year. In contrast, HCFA studies (HCFA 1992   ; HCIA, 1992) report information derived from state Medicaid plans and amendments, estimating ahead of time what rates will be each year; they are not adjusted when states make changes in their rates during a year. Thus, the rates presented here are outputs—average rates determined to have been used during a given year. These may differ somewhat from but be more accurate than estimates based on state plans.Employing a random-effects model, estimated using the PANEL option in LIMDEP (Greene 1995   ), we separately estimated effects on state average daily Medicaid nursing facility rates in constant dollars and in actual dollars of the inclusion of a set of ancillary services in those rates. Ancillaries considered were: physical therapy, occupational therapy, prescription drugs, nonlegend drugs, durable medical equipment (DME), medical supplies, and physician services.  Table 1  reports what states included each of these ancillaries in their rates in 1998.A linear regression model seems reasonable for the issue because inclusion of ancillaries should, in theory, involve the increase of per diem rates by some dollar amount for every ancillary included in a state's rates. Although the intent was to adjust only for the ancillaries, not for other factors that may influence costs, these other factors may influence both rates and policies regarding ancillaries, producing spurious relationships between ancillaries and rates. Therefore, state characteristics and policies that correlate with both the inclusion of some ancillaries and with rates were used as controls in two equations estimated as well as an equation using only the ancillaries as predictors. State characteristics considered were: total population, percentage of population aged 65 or older, percentage of population in metropolitan areas, per capita personal income in constant dollars, Medicaid home- and community-based waiver dollars per capita, and nursing facility beds per aged population. Reimbursement system measures were a set of dummy variables representing whether the state had a case-mix payment system and whether the reimbursement system was one of the following types: class, facility or patient-specific prospective unadjusted, facility or patient-specific prospective adjusted, or a combination prospective/retrospective system (the contrast was a retrospective system).Because state rate-setting policies (basic method and use of case-mix) may be endogenous with inclusion of ancillaries, equations were estimated both including and excluding such policy measures. No matter which measures were included in an equation, the adjustment of rates for the inclusion of ancillaries uses only the coefficient on the ancillaries.By the logic of the model, all coefficients on ancillaries should be positive, representing additional per diem payment to cover the costs of providing these ancillaries. Some coefficients may be found to be negative, however, perhaps even significant. It does not seem logical that rates would have been reduced when an ancillary was included in a rate. It does seem likely, however, that states may sometimes be less generous, providing both lower rates and including more services to be covered by those rates; thus, a negative coefficient on an ancillary may be seen as spurious, resulting from an unmeasured tendency to be less generous. Thus, such a finding must be treated with extreme caution.Comparison of ancillary-adjusted rates was done for only the latest year, 1998. Adjustment involved the subtracting of the coefficient for each ancillary from a state's 1998 rate if the state included that ancillary in the 1998 rate. This was done to attempt to compare rates after presumed state coverage of ancillary costs was subtracted out. The intent was neither to place a total value on a day of care (which in any case could not be done without considering other inclusions besides these seven ancillary services) nor to estimate actual costs of ancillary services. Therefore, the coefficients for excluded ancillaries were not added to the rate to produce a "total value" rate.As noted, only the coefficients on ancillaries were used for this adjustment, even though additional variables were employed in two of the three estimation equations. Where the coefficient was negative, this resulted in an addition to the rate. Results States varied widely in their inclusion of ancillaries in daily rates in 1998 ( Table 1  ). Every state included at least one of the ancillaries in the daily rate. Only three included prescription drugs in rates (those states included all seven types of ancillaries considered). By contrast, almost all of the states included nonprescription drugs (47 states) and medical supplies (48 states). All but 5 states treated physical and occupational therapy in the same way, 31 including both, and 15 excluding both. Table 2  reports the three equations estimated to predict daily rates. Although negative coefficients on ancillaries were estimated in all equations, none was significant in the equation that included only the ancillary-inclusion measures. Two coefficients were significant, that on the inclusion of nonlegend drugs and that on the inclusion of DME, the inclusion of either estimated to increase 1998 rates by about $6.50. There were negative but insignificant coefficients on physical therapy and on medical supplies.The findings are somewhat different when other factors are controlled for. The coefficient on DME remains positive and significant (about $6.00), but the coefficient on nonprescription drugs no longer is, whereas that on prescription drugs is. It should be noted, however, that only three states included prescription drugs, so the prescription-drug estimate would adjust rates for only these three states. Further, and more disturbingly, the coefficient on medical supplies is negative and significant in both equations with controls, suggesting a tendency for states that include medical supplies in their rates to also have somewhat lower rates. What is more disturbing is that in 1998 all but three states included medical supplies in daily rates, so that almost all states would have their rates adjusted upward for the inclusion of medical supplies in rates. Thus, results of adjusting for ancillaries while controlling for other factors should be considered very carefully. Table 3  provides rates adjusted by subtracting the coefficients on the ancillaries from the two models from the state average nursing facility per diem rates for 1998. The ancillary-only model yields adjusted rates that average about $7.00 less than actual rates, so about 7% of average rates across states (all figures unweighted for state size). By contrast, the model controlling for state characteristics and policies yields adjusted rates averaging almost exactly the same as actual rates; this suggests that the costs of ancillaries were not subtracted out of the rates on average, although differing state rates were adjusted for inclusion or exclusion of ancillaries. The states were ranked by their actual 1998 rates and by each of their ancillary-adjusted rates and are reported in  Table 3  according to their rankings. Table 4  reports the rankings from  Table 3  in a manner more convenient for comparison. Adjusting for the inclusion of ancillaries in rates leads in some cases to a very different ranking of states than obtained from ranking unadjusted rates. Delaware, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, and Wisconsin all drop at least five positions when the ancillary-only model is used; but only Missouri does when other factors are controlled for, with Michigan and Delaware coming close by, dropping four positions. Likewise, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, and Rhode Island each climb at least five positions using the ancillary-only model; but only Kentucky and Oregon do so when other controls are added to the model. Nebraska's rank climbs 16 places in the ancillary-only model, attributable to its inclusion in its rates of the single ancillary medical supplies, which had a nonsignificant but negative coefficient in the ancillary-only model. It climbs only one place in the full-control model, even though the medical-supplies coefficient is significantly negative because the value of the coefficient is smaller and because the adjusted rates for the other states tend to be higher than in the ancillary-only model.Overall, most states' rankings do not change much. With the ancillary-only model, 14 states show the same rank, and 14 others change rank by only one position. Where all controls are entered, 13 states remain unchanged in rank, while 12 change by only one rank. Thus, adjusting for ancillaries only, over half of the states (28) do not change by more than one place from their ranking of their unadjusted rates, and under half of the states plus DC (25) do using the model with all of the controls. Still, the many states that do change their ranks appreciably, and the few who change considerably, show the value of adjusting for ancillaries. Discussion Inclusion of ancillaries in calculating the Medicaid per diem nursing facility rate, as opposed to reimbursing such ancillaries separately, is an important discretionary policy that may impact not just rates paid, but also the costs borne, by Medicaid programs for nursing facility care. It may also affect access to nursing facilities, resident access to care within facilities, quality of care delivered, and equity across providers. The comparative rates paid by different states are therefore of extreme importance. This article reports adjustments of average state Medicaid daily nursing facility rates for the inclusion of a set of ancillary services, with a concern for greater validity of interstate comparisons of such rates.We conclude that public and industry policy makers, as well as researchers, should consider the inclusion of ancillaries in rates when considering the relative adequacy of per diem rates across states. Ancillaries as a group, and some specific ancillaries, show significant influence on average state Medicaid nursing facility rates. More importantly, some states show considerable changes in their ranking vis à vis other states when their rates are adjusted for inclusion of ancillaries. Some or all ancillaries should be adjusted for when comparing rates across states.Lower ranking should not in itself be taken as payment of an inferior rate. Some rankings are determined by only a few cents' difference in rates. However, after adjustment, 1998 rates still show from 5–1 to 4–1 ratios of highest to lowest adjusted average rates across states; and breaks between some ranks involve many dollars' difference. This extreme variation exists even after the list of ancillaries, and in some equations other factors, have been taken into account. This surely demonstrates great differences across states in the adequacy of their rates to cover good quality care, to provide adequate access to care, and to fairly reimburse providers for the care they give.This study is only of rates and their predictors, not of such other issues as quality, access, or equity. However, average state rates, as well as rates applied to specific facilities, can be and are used in studies focusing on these topics (e.g., studies of the relative quality provided or of access to facilities). We suggest that rates used in studies of such topics be adjusted for such factors as the inclusion of ancillaries in rates, in order to better understand the effects of rates on these factors net the effects of differential inclusion in them of ancillaries.There are limitations to this analysis. First, no adjustment was made for state fiscal year, so rates for some states are not adjusted for being up to 6 months older than rates for other states. Further, input factors that may be driving rates are not fully controlled. Thus, for example, New York will have higher rates than Kansas because land prices, labor, and so on are more expensive in New York. Average income per capita, percentage metropolitan, and nursing facility beds per aged should partially, but not fully, adjust for such factors. Better adjustment for costs of ancillaries would involve pricing of their costs and some determination of how those costs were, or were not, actually reflected in state rate setting.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The goal of this study was to develop a method of identifying incontinent nursing home (NH) residents capable of providing accurate interview information about daily NH care. Design and Methods: In 177 incontinent NH residents from four facilities, selected Minimum Data Set (MDS) ratings were compared with two standardized, performance-based, cognitive screening instruments to predict which residents could accurately answer questions concerning receipt of daily incontinence and mobility care practices. Results: MDS ratings of activity of daily living performance and cognition significantly predicted residents' ability to accurately describe daily care practices. Performance-based measures of cognitive functioning did not outperform the MDS ratings. Selecting residents who scored two or more on four orientation items composing the MDS Recall subscale identified residents capable of accurately describing daily care practices with a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 75%. Implications: The MDS-based criteria identified are a promising, objective method for selecting incontinent NH residents for interview to verify the occurrence of specific daily care practices.   Outcomes of care ,  Satisfaction ,  Assessment ,  Incontinence Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDFederal nursing home (NH) survey procedures require that a sample of NH residents be interviewed about the quality of their daily care; however, an objective definition of the term "interviewable" is not provided for use (Department of Health and Human Services 1995   ). The lack of an objective definition has resulted in the exclusion of unknown numbers of residents from interviews during the survey process to evaluate NH care quality.We have previously described criteria based on Minimum Data Set (MDS; Simmons et al. 1997   ) assessment scales that identified residents capable of accurately reporting the occurrence of daily care activities, such as toileting and walking assistance, with 88% sensitivity (i.e., inclusion of appropriate residents) and 70% specificity (i.e., exclusion of inappropriate residents). The inappropriate exclusion of residents with cognitive impairment who could accurately describe care accounted for the reduction in specificity of the MDS-based selection criteria (Simmons et al. 1997   ). Two other studies have also shown that a significant portion of verbally communicative, cognitively impaired NH residents are capable of reliably reporting their satisfaction with daily NH care and preferences for care; moreover, one of these studies also showed that NH staff were poor at identifying which residents were appropriate for interview (Maris, Soberman, Murray, and Norton 1996   ; Sansone, Schmitt, Nichols, Phillips, and Belisle 1998   ).MDS-based selection criteria can potentially be used to identify residents who should be included in interviews to evaluate the quality of daily NH care. This research applies the MDS-based resident selection criteria from our previous study (Simmons et al. 1997   ) to a subpopulation of the NH (incontinent residents), and compares those criteria to other performance-based cognitive status screening instruments to determine if the sensitivity and specificity of the selection criteria can be improved. The primary advantage of MDS-based resident selection criteria is that NH staff are required to complete the MDS for every resident.The purpose of this study was to determine the best method of identifying incontinent NH residents capable of providing accurate interview information about daily NH care practices. Incontinent residents were targeted for inclusion in this study because they represent the majority of a typical community NH population (Health Care Financing Administration 1997   ; Strahan 1997   ). Furthermore, incontinence in NH residents is known to be associated with greater cognitive and physical limitations (Mohide 1986   ; Ouslander, Kane, and Abrass 1982   ), which, in turn, are associated with poorer care quality (Coyne, Reichman, and Berbig 1993   ; Lacks and Pillemer 1995   ). It is useful, therefore, to develop resident selection criteria that can be applied to a large and particularly vulnerable subgroup of the NH population.Four questions were addressed in this study: (a) What percentage of incontinent NH residents are capable of accurate self-report with respect to the occurrence of daily care practices? (b) What chart (i.e., MDS) information can be used as criteria to identify incontinent residents capable of accurately describing daily care; and what is the sensitivity and specificity of the selection criteria? (c) Does the sensitivity and specificity of the MDS-based selection criteria improve when performance-based cognitive status measures are added to the criteria? and (d) What cutoff values can be established for the criteria to select incontinent residents appropriate for interview? Methods Validating the Accuracy of Residents' Reports of Daily Care Activities To evaluate the accuracy of NH residents' reports of care, we interviewed residents about the occurrence, frequency, and extent of staff assistance provided during an episode of incontinence and mobility care provided to residents while they were participating in a larger clinical intervention trial. The incontinence and mobility care provided as part of this trial, which is described elsewhere (Schnelle, MacRae, Ouslander, Simmons, and Nitta 1995   ), is consistent with current NH care practice guidelines. Briefly, incontinence care (i.e., pad changes and toileting assistance) and mobility assistance (i.e., walking or wheelchair propulsion) were rendered by research staff every 2 hours, 4 times per day, 5 days per week, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Research staff documented the number of times each resident required a pad change, accepted toileting assistance or walking assistance, and engaged in wheelchair mobility in addition to the extent of staff assistance provided to maximize independence. A research assistant who was unaware of the frequency of each care activity occurrence (i.e., whether or not a resident accepted or refused a care activity) interviewed residents using the "accuracy validation interview" at the end of an 8-hour period following research staff incontinence and mobility care provision. The "accuracy validation interview" is a brief interview with 20 structured questions regarding the occurrence of (e.g., "Did someone help you to walk today?"), frequency (e.g., How many times did someone help you walk today?"), and the extent of staff assistance provided (e.g., "Do you need someone with you/to help you when you walk?") for incontinence and mobility care practices.The interview was administered by research staff to each participant independently in a private room to ensure confidentiality. Interviewers were trained and supervised in the administration of the standardized interview protocol, including prompts for each question. Interviewers were aware of hearing and/or visual limitations; however, they were not aware of cognitive status. Nonverbal responses (i.e., nod or shake of the head to indicate yes or no, respectively; indicating frequency with fingers) were acceptable. No cognitive screening criteria were used to select residents for interview. Measures Background Variables Age, gender, ethnicity, length of NH stay in days, and the presence or absence of a chart diagnosis of depression or dementia were recorded from each participant's medical record. Three established MDS scale scores were derived from individual MDS items from each participant's most recent MDS assessment, version 2.0: Activities of Daily Living (MDS-ADL), Social Initiative–Involvement (MDS-SII), and the Depression Rating Scale (MDS-DRS). The reliability, validity, and item content of each of these scales are described elsewhere (Burrows, Morris, Simon, Hirdes, and Phillips 2000   ; Hartmaier, Sloane, Guess, and Koch 1994   ; Hartmaier et al. 1995   ; Hawes et al. 1995   ; Mor et al. 1995   ; Morris et al. 1994   ). Cognitive Status The Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) was calculated from the most recent MDS assessment. The CPS is based on five MDS items (see  Table 1  ), and the total score ranges from 0 (cognitively intact) to 6 (severely impaired). In addition, all 10 MDS items related to cognitive functioning were used to create two scale scores, Direct and Indirect, and one subscale score, Recall. The Direct and Indirect scales were recently recommended by Hartmaier and colleagues 1995    as a more useful way to denote the cognitive functioning of NH residents than the CPS. The Direct scale consists of seven items related to memory, orientation, and decision-making skills, which yield a composite score with a range of 0 (i.e., no memory problems, oriented, independent decision making) to 9 (i.e., severely impaired) for each participant (see  Table 1  ). The Recall subscale comprises the following four orientation items that are also part of the Direct scale: (a) current season, (b) location of own room, (c) staff names and/or faces, and (d) awareness of being in an NH, with a score range of 0 to 4 (i.e., able to recall all four items). Thus, in order to sum all items for the Direct scale total score, the Recall subscale score must be reverse coded (i.e., 4 = unable to recall any of the four items). The Indirect scale consists of 10 items related to comprehension, communication, problem behaviors, self-feeding ability, and continence status, which results in a composite score with a range of 0 (i.e., no impairment) to 20 (i.e., impaired on all items) for each participant (see  Table 1  ).Two performance-based measures of cognitive functioning were administered to all participants: the standardized Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Test for Severe Impairment (TSI). The properties of each of these measures are described elsewhere (Albert and Cohen 1992   ; Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ; Molloy, Alemayehu, and Roberts 1991   ). We expected that both the MMSE and TSI instruments would provide better indicators of residents' cognitive functioning than the MDS cognitive items because of the difference in assessment approaches (i.e., performance-based versus NH staff categorical ratings). In addition, the TSI is designed to discriminate specifically among lower cognitive functioning residents (i.e., MMSE total score <11). Definition of Accurate Self-Report Each participant's ability to accurately describe their received care was assessed in several ways. First, we computed a chance-corrected measure of agreement (i.e., Kappa) between each participant's self-report and research staff documentation of care activity occurrence. Participants with a Kappa value ≥0.70 were classified as capable of "accurate" self-report. The proportion of participants who would be considered accurate based on lower Kappa values (i.e., ≥0.60) was also examined. Second, the percentage of interview questions answered accurately was calculated for each participant by type of question: (1) all 20 interview questions, (2) only the 6 questions related to frequency of care activity occurrence, and (3) the remaining 14 questions related to occurrence and whether or not staff assistance was provided for each activity. Residents were classified as accurate if their percent agreement was ≥80%. The three different percent agreement values were compared for the group of participants with paired-samples t tests, and the proportion of participants who would be considered accurate based on the three different percent agreement values were compared with chi-square analyses. Data Analyses To determine if there were differences between those who provided complete "accuracy interview" data and those who did not, demographic, MDS, and performance-based cognitive status variables were compared with independent-samples t tests for the continuous variables and chi-square analyses for the categorical variables. Predicting Accurate Residents: Validation of a Screening Instrument In order to identify measures that predicted accuracy status for participants, an exploratory correlational analysis was first conducted to identify independent variables (i.e., demographic characteristics, MDS-derived scale scores, and performance-based cognitive assessment scores) significantly correlated with either measure of resident accuracy (i.e., Kappa or percent agreement). The independent variables that proved to be significantly correlated with resident accuracy, but not significantly intercorrelated at a level ≥0.80, were entered into a series of logistic regression analyses to predict membership in the accurate group based on each of the definitions of accuracy described earlier. For the MDS-derived scale that was most highly associated with residents' ability to describe care accurately, the sensitivity and specificity values were then calculated for various cutpoints that could be used to discriminate accurate from inaccurate residents. Results Participants A total of 186 (85%) of 220 residents across four facilities participating in the clinical trial provided complete data for the accuracy interview. Reasons for incomplete or no interview data for the remaining 34 participants were primarily due to death or resident refusal to answer the interview questions. The demographic characteristics, MDS-derived scale scores, and performance-based cognitive status assessment scores for the group of 186 participants are displayed in  Table 2  . There were no significant differences with respect to any of these demographic or functional characteristics between the 186 participants who provided complete interview data and the 34 who did not. In general, the study sample reflects moderate to severe levels of both cognitive and physical impairment, which is typical of the incontinent segment of the NH population (Mohide 1986   ; Ouslander et al. 1982   ). Accuracy Validation The proportion of participants who were considered accurate based on the 80% correct criterion was dependent upon the type of interview question. A significantly higher proportion of participants were classified as accurate based on responses to questions about occurrence and staff assistance (47%) versus frequency (28%, χ2 (1, N = 186) = 35.3, p < .001). A total of 65 (35%) participants were considered accurate based on all 20 interview questions. A total of 59 (32%) of the 186 participants were classified as "accurate" according to the Kappa value ≥0.70 criterion. These 59 participants represent 27% of those 220 residents initially targeted for interview. When the Kappa criterion was lowered to ≥0.60, 73 participants (39%) were deemed "accurate."In our previous work, the MDS-derived ADL, CPS, and SII scales significantly predicted accuracy status defined as ≥80% or more correct on occurrence and assistance questions on an "accuracy interview" (Simmons et al. 1997   ). In this study, the following variables were significantly correlated with each participant's percent agreement: ADL, CPS, Direct, Indirect, Recall, and MMSE scores (see  Table 2  ). These same variables were also significantly correlated with Kappa values, with the addition of the presence or absence of a depression diagnosis (see  Table 2  ). Only two intercorrelations between MDS-based cognitive functioning scales exceeded a value of 0.80: CPS-Direct, r = .882; and Recall-Direct, r = .942. The remainder of the variables listed in  Table 2  (i.e., demographic characteristics, mood indicators) were not significantly related to accuracy according to any criterion.When the MDS-based selection criteria from the previous study (i.e., CPS, ADL, and SII scales) were applied to the sample of incontinent residents in this study using the 80% agreement percentage based only on the occurrence and assistance questions as the accuracy criterion, 63% were correctly identified as appropriate for interview (i.e., sensitivity) and 79% were correctly identified as inappropriate for interview (specificity), with an overall correct classification rate of 72%. The CPS scale was the primary significant predictor in the equation (b = −.70, SE = .16, R = −.27, p < .001) with the ADL scale approaching significance (b = −.53, SE = .29, R = −.07, p = .06) and the SII scale not significant (b = .04, SE = .13, R = .00, p = .77).In order to compare the predictive value of the MDS-derived scales to the predictive value of the MMSE, we computed a series of logistic regression models. The collinearity between three potential predictors (i.e., Direct-CPS, Direct-Recall) prevented these variables from being entered into the same model. The following MDS-derived independent variables were entered into a predictive model: ADL, Direct, and Indirect scales ( Table 3  , Model 1); and ADL, CPS, Indirect, and Recall scales ( Table 3  , Model 2). A third model was analyzed in which the MMSE total score was entered as the independent variable ( Table 3  , Model 3). The results of the three logistic regression models were comparable regardless of the criterion used to determine accuracy status (i.e., Kappa value ≥0.70 or ≥0.60, percent agreement based on all 20 interview questions versus 14 occurrence and assistance questions versus 6 frequency questions). The results displayed in  Table 3  are based on the percent agreement criterion for only questions related to staff occurrence and assistance, as this criterion resulted in the largest number of participants being deemed capable of accurate self-report with respect to their daily care. These results show negligible differences among the three models with respect to predicting residents' ability to accurately describe their received care.Based on the results of the logistic regression analyses, the score distributions of the MDS-derived Recall subscale were examined in order to determine a cutoff value that maximally differentiated accurate from inaccurate residents as defined by the 80% criterion based only on interview questions related to occurrence and assistance. The average Recall subscale score for accurate participants was 2.35 (± 1.52) with a mode of 4 (i.e., rated by NH staff as capable of recalling all four items: current season, location of own room, staff names and/or faces, and that he or she is in a NH), whereas the average for inaccurate participants was 0.82 (± 1.06) with a mode of 0 (i.e., rated by NH staff as incapable of recalling any of the four items). Both groups, however, showed a full range of Recall subscale values (0–4). Three potential cutoff values were examined: a Recall subscale score ≥1, 2, or 3. Three logistic regression analyses were then conducted in order to determine the sensitivity (i.e., correct classification of accurate) and specificity (i.e., correct classification of inaccurate) that would result from each cutoff value. The sensitivity and specificity of a Recall subscale cutoff value ≥1 was 82% and 54%, respectively, with an overall correct classification rate of 67%. A total of 113 (64%) of the participants had a Recall subscale score ≥1. If a Recall subscale cutoff value ≥2 was used, the sensitivity decreased to 64% and the specificity increased to 75%. The overall correct classification rate remained approximately the same, 70%. A total of 78 (44%) of the participants scored ≥2 on the Recall subscale. Finally, a cutoff value ≥3 (n = 56, 32% of participants) resulted in 57% sensitivity and 92% specificity (i.e., exclusion of the majority of inaccurate residents but at the expense of excluding many who were accurate as well), with an overall correct classification rate of 75%. Discussion The present study replicated the results of our previous study (Simmons et al. 1997   ), which documented that many NH residents are capable of accurately describing their received care and that MDS-derived cognitive status variables are excellent predictors of their accuracy status. Surprisingly, the use of a standardized cognitive performance test (i.e., MMSE) did not improve upon the predictive value of the MDS-based cognitive performance scales. Based on the results of this study, the most time-efficient and simple approach to identify incontinent NH residents capable of accurately describing the care that they receive would be to calculate the MDS Recall subscale score and include all residents in the interview who score 2 or higher on this scale. This calculation could be completed quickly if one has access to the MDS information, which is available for all NH residents. The use of the highly efficient MDS Recall scale to identify incontinent NH residents capable of accurate self-report is more defensible than the untested approaches to screening that have been described in other studies (Aller and Coeling 1995   ; Lavizzo-Mourey, Zinn, and Taylor 1992   ; Pearson, Hocking, Mott, and Riggs 1992   ). Most typically, the approach used in other studies to identify NH residents capable of interview is to have NH staff use subjective criteria to identify residents or to apply MMSE cutoff scores (Aller and Coeling 1995   ; Berlowitz, Du, Kazis, and Lewis 1995   ; Lavizzo-Mourey et al. 1992   ). The use of such criteria results in a much larger proportion of residents being excluded from interview as compared to the use of the MDS-based Recall scale score of 2 or higher in this study. It is important to note, however, that the intent of this study was to identify incontinent NH residents who could accurately describe the daily care that they received as opposed to identifying residents who could simply respond to interview questions. The care practices used in this study to verify accuracy were frequent daily occurrences in the context of the larger clinical trial (e.g., toileting and walking assistance) and concrete, unambiguous events. It is, therefore, not surprising that a measure of residents' ability to recall other everyday events (e.g., staff names/faces, awareness of being in an NH) should predict accuracy. We cannot say, based on these results, whether this screening method would perform similarly well when trying to identify NH residents who can reliably respond to questions about their mood, experience of pain, satisfaction, and preferences related to daily care. On the one hand, the ability to understand these types of questions and report subjective, emotional experiences may require abstract reasoning, which might be lost when recall is preserved in an individual with cognitive impairment. On the other hand, these experiences are subjective and immediate. There is, thus, no requirement that recall be intact in order to reliably report such personal experiences, emotions, and preferences.The primary value of identifying accurate residents, as we did in this study, lies in the quality assurance arena. As there is reason to believe that chart documentation of many care activities may be inaccurate (e.g., how often a nursing assistant records that toileting or walking assistance was rendered to an individual resident), it is necessary to assess NH care quality with multiple approaches. In addition to chart review, these alternative approaches involve either directly observing daily care routines or interviewing residents. We have described a screening methodology that will efficiently permit interview quality assurance strategies to be implemented in the NH setting.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined change in the decision-making autonomy of a single nursing facility resident. Design and Methods: This case analysis was part of a larger 3-year ethnographic investigation of decision-making events in four nursing facilities. In this case analysis, the resident, her daughter, and three staff members closely associated with the resident's care were each interviewed five times over a 15-month period. Results: Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four themes in decision making. Temporal change was evident in a complex scenario regarding room changes. Spatial context reflected the need for predictability and adaptability in decisions using space. Interdependence of decisions and decision makers was most evident with medical treatment and health care decisions. Awareness, being informed, and knowing what was going on was the final theme. Implications: Despite having the best interests of the resident in mind, the process of decision making in nursing facilities may contribute to a pattern of gradual withdrawal of decisional autonomy from residents regardless of their ability to make decisions.   Long-term care ,  Case study ,  Decision making ,  Progressive surrogacy Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDFor many residents, life in a nursing facility consists of a repeated daily cycle of predictable activities occasionally punctuated by a specially scheduled social event, a visit from "outside," or the stress of a health crisis. Over weeks, months, and sometimes years of residence, the repetitive rhythm and routine of each day provides a sense of familiarity and regularity, a sense of "being in place" (Rowles 1991   , Rowles 2000   ).The nature of a resident's being in place is to a significant extent a function of the decision-making environment in each setting and the degree to which the resident him- or herself is involved as an active participant in decisions that shape his or her daily life and milieu. Involvement, or lack of involvement, in everyday decisions such as those involving the placement of furniture, timing of meals, choice of seating in the dining room, and routine health care often greatly affects a resident's well-being and accommodation to the institutional setting (High and Rowles 1995   ; Rowles and High 1996   , Rowles and High in press   ). There is a growing literature in the domain of decision making in nursing facilities and the degree to which residents are involved (Bradley, Peiris, and Wetle 1998   ; Capitman and Sciegaj 1995   ; Kayser-Jones 1995   ; Ryden 1985   ). For example, Bradley and associates 1998    studied the frequency with which nursing home residents and their surrogates discussed with clinicians the resident's wishes concerning future treatment. They concluded that no discussions were documented for most residents. Even for those with documented discussions, conversations occurred rarely and were narrow in scope, suggesting that residents' roles in medical decision making were limited. Ryden's nursing home study revealed that caregivers saw themselves as the predominant decision makers. Only in one-to-one and solitary activities did they prefer giving residents the primary decision-making role, possibly because they viewed most residents as incapable of making decisions. In contrast, Lantz, Buchalter, and McBee 1997    found that using a wellness group to emphasize residents' strengths and their individual coping and decision-making skills assisted in counteracting the tendency for staff to control much of resident behavior. Placing decision making within a broader conceptual framework, Capitman and Sciegaj 1995    proposed a contextual autonomy model that focuses on relationships and the context of decision making involving the individual, other persons, and the social institution.For all its sameness, the routine of institutional life is dynamic, and so are the decisions that determine this routine. Regular patterns of daily behavior are gradually and progressively modified as the individual's health status and life circumstances change. With increasing physical frailty and/or cognitive impairment, decisions pertaining to the pattern of daily life evolve through a complex process of "progressive surrogacy" as control over activities and decision-making responsibility for those activities gradually shifts away from the resident toward family members and staff (High and Rowles 1995   ). Individual residents may fluctuate through alternative phases of decline and recovery of decision-making capacity in various domains but, for the majority, the overall trajectory is one of reduced involvement in decisions affecting their lives.In this article, we document aspects of change in the decision-making autonomy of a single nursing facility resident through interpretation of what are, for her, and for those who surround her, key decision-making incidents. In this context, an incident is liberally defined as a specific episode requiring a decision, for example, the determination of where to sit in the dining room. Such a decision may involve a series of separate interactions among the resident, family members, and staff over a number of days, weeks, or, in some cases, months.Our objective is threefold. First, insight is provided into the manner in which an individual's life in a nursing facility is shaped by a constantly evolving decision-making milieu involving the self, family members, institutional personnel, and implicit, often taken-for-granted, institutional rules, norms, and expectations. Second, using a case study approach (Barlow and Hersen 1984   ; Davis 1991   ; Fielding 1994   ; Meier and Pugh 1986   ; Stake 2000   ), we illustrate the importance of understanding decision-making processes in institutions, as they are uniquely manifest in the life experience of individual residents and their families. Finally, we present the argument that detailed understanding of decision making as it pertains to transitions in a single resident's life provides a dynamic holistic perspective on the nature of their being in place in the world of the nursing facility. Methods Design The subject of the analysis was a participant in a 3-year study funded by the National Institute on Aging (Grant AG-08475; Everard, Rowles and High 1994   ; High and Rowles 1995   ; Rowles, Concotelli, and High 1996   ; Rowles and High 1996   ). Protection of subject rights in the 3-year study and in this case analysis was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. This longitudinal ethnographic investigation in four nursing facilities involved participant observation, event analysis, and repeated in-depth tape-recorded interviews with 64 nursing home residents older than 75 years of age and with members of the constellation of actors involved in their daily lives. For each resident, a decision-making constellation was defined operationally as including the resident, the resident's physician, the nursing home administrator, the nurse, the certified nursing assistant (CNA) having the most daily contact with the resident, and two members of the resident's family (including the self-identified primary caregiver). In some cases, other actors such as a social worker, minister, or lawyer judged to be involved in decision making pertaining to the resident were included.The objective was to explore the changing dynamic of family involvement in decision making as the institutionalized relative became increasingly frail and, in the case of cognitively impaired persons, progressively less able to make decisions. Five waves of interviews (approximately 3 months apart) were conducted with the residents and the members of their decision-making constellation (see Appendix, Note 1). As interaction with participants occurred over a 3-year period of time, interviews ranged in length from 30 min to over 4 hr. In some cases, due to the participant's health condition or other special circumstances, interviews were brief. In others, where the participant became highly involved in the discussion, interviews extended over a considerable time period. In some cases, including those conducted with family members in their homes, the interviews extended to 4 hr.Individual decisions affecting each resident's life were explored within the framework of eight categories of decisions. These categories were identified on the basis of a pilot study of two complete constellations. A series of meetings, involving all six researchers involved in the larger study (see  Appendix , Note 2), were held in which information from the pilot interviews and material developed from extensive review of extant decision-making and nursing facility literature were used to develop a comprehensive listing of decision categories. The 87 different types of decisions identified through this process were then grouped into eight levels of decisions, which remained fixed throughout the study.According to our a priori criteria, crisis and life-and-death decisions included foregoing or avoiding life-sustaining treatment, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, do not resuscitate orders, and intravenous or tube feeding. Mental competence was defined as including guardianship, durable power of attorney, confusion, and decision-making capacity. Transfer decisions were defined as including hospitalization, discharge, or room changes within the facility. Financial decisions were defined as including payment to the nursing facility, "spend-down," and management of income or assets. Medical treatment and health care were defined as surgery, medication, physical therapy, occupational therapy, use of assistive devices, and routine health maintenance. Decisions regarding the social environment were defined to include selection of roommates, resolution of roommate problems, participation in social activities, dining arrangements, relationships with other residents and staff members, and recreational activities. Decisions regarding the physical environment were defined as those involving arrangement of furniture in a resident's room; temperature control; display of personal items; ownership and placement of a television, radio, or telephone; and room maintenance and cleaning. Finally, daily living decisions were defined as the timing of activities, access to facility resources (e.g., the telephone), food choices, selection of clothing, bathing schedule, hair care, maintenance of privacy, smoking, kitchen privileges, and other everyday choices affecting residents' quality of life.Sample components of the protocol provide an indication of the types of questions posed. The first component involved identification of decisions in the previous 3 months for each level of decision making. Acknowledging concerns about the long-term recall of everyday mundane decisions, such as decisions about the physical environment and daily living, participants were asked to recall decisions made in the previous month.Once a decision had been identified, the interviewer used a second component of the protocol to explore the characteristics and circumstances surrounding the decision and the level of involvement of each member of the constellation. Probe questions included: (a) "What decision was made?" (b) "When did this occur?" (c) "What were the circumstances that led to this decision?" (d) "Who was involved in making this decision?" and (e) "How much were you involved in the decision?" In addition, participants were asked to describe the process (sequence of events/meetings) by which the decision was made. Particular attention was given to the role of family and friends. Probes here included: (a) "How much were family members or friends of the resident involved in the decision-making process?" (b) "Which family member(s) or friend(s) were involved?" and (c) "How were they involved?"The next section of the protocol addressed the involvement of staff. Participants were asked, "Did any member of the staff who was unrelated to the resident act like a family member?" They were also asked to comment on how they felt about the decision and the degree to which family members were involved. The same overall protocol was used for each participant with only minor and necessary word changes to make the protocol appropriate for each person interviewed.Analyses of the complete data set are reported elsewhere (see Everard et al. 1994   ; High and Rowles 1995   ; Rowles and High 1996   , Rowles and High in press   ). At this point, we have begun in-depth review and analyses of the decision-making experiences of individual residents to provide a holistic perspective on their immersion within the nursing home milieu. Edna is one of these residents (see  Appendix , Note 3). Our study of Edna was undertaken in order to investigate and understand, in detail, the life of one resident viewed within the context of her decision-making constellation. In studying a single nursing home resident, we were concerned with the "confluence" rather than the "influence" of variables (Sandelowski 1996   , p. 526). "In the rush to find core variables, recurring themes, and transferable concepts, analysts of qualitative data too often miss the idiosyncratic, unique, and non-fungible features of cases that give them their integrity, and make them so valuable for study" (Sandelowski 1996   , p. 525). This perspective is more contextually sensitive and discriminating in revealing nuances of an individual's institutional life than are most sample- and population-based studies. Indeed, we suggest that detailed study of an individual resident's life can provide a mirror of broader concerns regarding the conduct of institutional life (Hunter 1989   ; Tanner, Benner, Chesla, and Gordon 1993   ): It facilitates the translation and representation of personal troubles as societal concerns (Mills 1959   ).We selected an individual rather than a particular facility location or time period as the unit of analysis because we were concerned with viewing decision-making processes surrounding and involving individual residents within a holistic context. The life of a nursing home resident, such as Edna, tends to be focused on the limited number of individuals with whom he or she comes into routine daily contact. In contrast with community-dwelling elders, nursing facility residents tend to inhabit a naturally bounded behavioral and social world that can be both conceptually and operationally defined. Hence, we determined that it was appropriate not only methodologically but also substantively to focus on the individual.Edna was selected because she was cognitively intact and was particularly articulate throughout the entire study. There were five interviews with Edna herself, as well as a complete set of interviews with several members of her decision-making constellation over the 15 months of data collection. Many residents were cognitively impaired at the beginning of the study or developed memory difficulties or physical ailments that prevented them from completing five interviews. We now turn our attention to Edna and to the decisions affecting her life in a nursing facility. Case Study: Edna Edna Wishart was born in rural Fenton County and lived there for nearly 60 of her 88 years. She taught school for 34 years. Married for 58 years, she had one daughter, Joyce, a son-in-law, and a granddaughter. As Edna entered her 80s, her health and that of her husband, Albert, declined. Following several acute illness episodes resulting in hospitalization, the couple moved together into a nursing facility in Gloucester, the county seat.This arrangement worked well until Albert's health began to decline more rapidly and he needed cancer treatment that could not be provided by the facility. At this point, Joyce arranged for her parents to move to Concord (Joyce's hometown, about 1.5 hr from Gloucester), where Albert entered a nursing facility providing a higher level of care. Edna moved in with her daughter. This arrangement was a temporary solution, allowing time for Joyce to arrange for her parents to be in a room together in another Concord nursing facility, Elizabeth Manor. "We closed up everything in Gloucester (their lifetime home), auctioned it, kind of closed that chapter for her."Shortly after the couple moved to Elizabeth Man-or, Albert died. Edna left the facility, once again spent a few months living with her daughter, and subsequently moved to an assisted living facility. After an acute episode with a bleeding ulcer, she returned to Elizabeth Manor where, at the commencement of our study, she had been in residence for almost 2 years. Against the backdrop of this profile of Edna's personal history and life circumstances, we offer an analysis of the institutional decision-making context and processes of decision making that shaped her life in Elizabeth Manor. Analyzing the Data Data collected on Edna comprised a total of 28 interviews: 5 each with Edna and her daughter and 6 with the nurse, the CNA (see  Appendix , Note 4), and the administrator/social worker. Each interview was transcribed verbatim. First, Edna's transcripts and those of each member of her decision-making constellation were read. An initial line-by-line coding generated many categories. These categories served to inform our subsequent analysis of interviews and transcripts. Then coding was completed for each actor in the constellation to characterize that person's role in decision making involving Edna. A second phase of analysis involved organizing and reading the transcripts in chronological sequence (Wolcott 1994   ) in order to obtain a sense of the unfolding of decision-making events during Edna's residence as they occurred over time. Again, line-by-line coding was used to identify categories and retrieve chunks of data pertaining to specific emerging themes. Third, the conceptual framework of the eight decision-making categories provided a guide to analyze the data. Worksheets were developed to summarize the data concerning each of the eight main categories of decision making. However, we were also attentive and sensitive to additional themes that emerged in addition to those revealed within the rubric of the eight decision-making categories. A final phase in data analysis involved detailed discussion among us about the data and emergent categories and themes. Efforts were made to progressively move the analysis from description to more abstract and higher levels of understanding and insight.  Table 1  provides examples of the progression of coding and theme identification from participant statements, through the detection of themes, to higher and more abstract levels of revealed meaning. Findings Overview Overall, the pattern of decisions made affecting Edna reflected the partial and ephemeral involvement of diverse members of her constellation in different decision-making incidents at different points during her tenure at Elizabeth Manor. The nursing home administrator was involved in few of the everyday decisions directly affecting Edna's quality of life. Pat, the social worker, was involved in some categories of decisions and was a significant participant in the decision-making process surrounding Edna's desire for a room change. Joyce was more fully and continuously involved in multiple categories of decision making regarding Edna, although she seemed to have a "snapshot" view of her mother's life in the nursing home derived from visits of about 1 hr two or three times a week. More intimately involved on an ongoing basis were the nurse and especially the CNA, who spent the most time in direct contact with Edna. Finally, as was revealed through the series of interviews, Edna herself felt ambivalent and progressively less involved in decisions affecting her life as time passed. In the initial interview, she clearly indicated her active role in the decision to enter the facility.I didn't want to stay with my daughter … They both work and I just feel like they have their friends and they're just as good to me. I stayed down there 3 months. I just felt like I was kind a fifth wheel.But by the final interview, her growing ambivalence and passivity were evident from an equivocal and pensive response to the question of the degree to which she had been adequately involved in decisions. "I guess I have. If it had been left up to me? If I'd have made the same decisions that have been made or not? … I've accepted them. Let's just say I've accepted them."As our analysis proceeded, themes of temporal change, spatial context, interdependency, and awareness in decision making emerged as major components of the decision-making trajectory that shaped Edna's life in Elizabeth Manor. All four decision-making foci serve as exemplars of more general themes posited to underlie the process of progressive surrogacy in nursing facility decision making. Honor My Preferences While I Can Express Them: Temporal Theme "I just want to move." The scenario began with a simple request from Edna, "I just want to move," reported by Pat, the social worker (November 20, 1991). Pat talked with Edna and probed to find the rationale for her request to move to Room 16 (from a private to a semiprivate room). Aware of Edna's financial situation, Pat thought money might be the reason. Pat then talked with Joyce and explained that she thought there would be conflict with the current resident of the room.Joyce added another dimension to this picture. In an interview approximately 2 months (January 29, 1992) after her initial discussion with Pat, she reported, "Mom decided a private room was too costly so she started scouting around looking for openings, rooms, semiprivates. She initiated the discussion with Pat." During this interview, Joyce reiterated that her mother was "private pay" and was aware she needed to make her money last as long as possible. Joyce confirmed that Edna did, indeed, find a room—Room 16—which happened to be where she and Albert had resided when they first entered the facility, and the room where he had died. Joyce reported,Pat was a little bit concerned about the person she'd be in the room with, but Pat did not say, "Don't do it." She just said, "Let's think about it a little bit longer and let's see, you know, what comes, what happens, what develops." Pat and I talked and Pat expressed the concerns that she had also expressed to Mom about the lady who's in the room not being coherent and not being, perhaps, a suitable roommate for Mom. I also reminded her that Mom likes the privacy of her bathroom and that she would have to share a bath if she went to another room. (January 29, 1992)Following this conversation, Pat and Joyce talked Edna out of moving to Room 16.The three of us never sat down and talked. Pat talked with Mom quite a bit and then I talked with both of them, but we did not sit down as a threesome. So Mom decided that she would wait and Pat's concern was that if all of the rooms become Medicare approved, if Mom's money, since she's on spend-down now, that she would not have to move. That was what Pat was hoping, you know, that she'd be able to stay in the room she's in.Several months after this interview, Joyce confirmed her mother's continuing concern about moving to a semiprivate room to perhaps save money. "She's had this idea some time that if she moved to [a] semiprivate room it would be half the cost" (August 17, 1992). (In fact, moving to a semiprivate room would not have halved the cost, but differing interpretations of this issue confounded and complicated the decision-making process for Edna, Joyce, and Pat.)Nearly 1 year after Edna's initial request, she was finally transferred from her private room to a semiprivate room after she reached her spend-down limit and became a Medicaid recipient. Pat shows in an interview conducted about this time:The major decision in the last 3 months? To transfer from one room to another, from a private to a semiprivate. You probably have this, what's funny, well, it's not funny but what's interesting is you probably have the same interview information way back when, when she wanted to move and we didn't think she should and now I wish we would have let her move … I've learned my lesson to listen to the residents (November 13, 1992).Three weeks later, Joyce also expressed regret about not listening to her mother's initial request and the missed opportunity for autonomous decision making and respect for Edna's self-determination.Now she's a Medicaid patient … I think it would have been better if she'd gone ahead and moved at that time [initial request] … Pat told me she learned a lot from this experience … and the fact that she needed to listen to residents more … It was hard to figure out her thinking on that [financial], but the fact … is that there was a bed available. It was over by the window and it was the room she and Dad were in. Now that was my problem with the room … Well, she'd be in the bed where Dad was … I think it would have been [hard on her] and Pat did too, once we talked about that. She [Pat] was also concerned about her being in the room. Pat wants her to be in a room with someone who's coherent … The important thing about this is that Mom made the decision. She was ready to move [initially] and we took it away from her. And that is why Pat said we both learned. We should have let her; that was very important to her and we just took it away (December 4, 1992).Surprisingly, Edna herself provides yet another perspective on this room change decision-making process. What was critical to her about Room 16 was her knowledge of space in the room, particularly the bathroom. She also expressed her loneliness in a private room, yet staff reported how Edna seemed to like privacy and often stayed in her room. In an interview when she finally moved (as it turned out, into another private room), Edna reflected on the experience.The girls helped me move … Oh, I just moved here [present room]. I wanted to move back over in 16, over on the other wing, and she [Pat] came in here and talked me out of it … They didn't know I'd get along with the one that was in the room or not and I don't know but I would have and so she said, well, I'm not going to bother you anymore. She, Pat, told me that she saw where she didn't listen to the resident and made her own decision. If she had listened to me, it would have been better if I moved over there. I didn't want this high-priced room. I didn't care about being by myself. I didn't care about staying by myself. It got kinda boresome sometimes. And I'd been in that room over there [16] and I knew I could get around, how to manage, and there was just two people using the bathroom and nobody else, and it was a larger bathroom, too (December 1, 1992).Viewed in a longitudinal context, this was a situation in which Edna tried to be proactive. She had intimate knowledge of the layout of Room 16 because she had shared it with her husband. She knew she would only have to share the bathroom with one other person. Both factors were important to her. However, Edna found that she had little say in the move. Only after the fact did Pat and Joyce realize that Edna had sound personal and practical reasons for her request. I Need My Own Personal Space, Especially at Mealtimes: Spatial Theme "Somebody's sitting in my seat." Decisions in nursing facilities are made not only over time but also in space. Indeed, time and space are intimately interrelated, as was clearly revealed in the room change decision. A number of decisions pertinent to Edna's life concerned her use of space in Elizabeth Manor. Like most of Elizabeth Manor's residents, Edna was concerned with seating arrangements. Seating arrangements, especially for mealtimes, involved complex, partly implicit, and generally taken-for-granted norms and rules of behavior that were part of the ritual and culture of Elizabeth Manor. The identity of this environment as a behavior setting (Barker 1968   ; Norris-Baker 1998   ) depended on conformation to the established patterns.Disruption of established territorial imperatives could occur quickly and be a source of considerable distress to residents. The nurse who worked most closely with Edna reported that, on at least one occasion, Edna had been adamant about her position at her table in the dining room. "Somebody's sitting in my seat and I've been there for 2 years. I don't like it." The CNA who spent the most time with Edna made a similar observation: "The only thing she gets upset about is, if the seating arrangements [have] been changed at her table. She outwardly seems like she likes everybody, but you can tell from her attitude and eyes she doesn't care for someone." As Edna's daughter, Joyce, explained, "You don't realize what a big deal it is of who's going to be sitting where at meals. It's a big deal, you know. I guess we're creatures of habit." As residents possess so little, the importance of predictability of places at the eating table may become critical in the daily life of nursing home residents.Paradoxically, the interviews acknowledging territoriality also revealed flexibility and adaptability of patients and staff. Edna herself reported, "Well I just moved around. I'd go in and they'd be in the place where I sat. Someone would be there and I'd go to another place … I think I moved three times." Edna's flexibility was perceived by staff as indicative of increasing sociability. As the CNA noted, "Lately she's been changing her seating. She's kind of been socializing a little bit." The nurse who worked most closely with Edna also confirmed that: "She's been a little more social. She still sits at the same place but we have a new resident who is ‘with it’ and she and Edna sit together and talk."Not all the members of Edna's decision-making constellation were as perceptive regarding her spatial preferences. Pat admitted she was neither involved nor at all enlightened about the process of decision making for seating arrangements.I got the whole seating arrangement in the whole place mixed up. It's amazing what these sitters [CNAs] know. I'm not sure why [they sit people where they do]; they may know, but just don't tell me. Or I just don't ask the right questions.Joyce was similarly mystified, although she acknowledged the importance of seating arrangements. "It does somehow [get decided] because they all have their space and it's just interesting."As with decisions about room changes, there were divergent opinions about who made decisions concerning seating arrangements in the dining room at Elizabeth Manor, and the process whereby such decisions were made. On one hand, Edna felt she made her own choices about where to sit. On the other hand, as Edna's nurse stated, "We [nurses and assistants] kind of make the decisions [regarding seating for residents] between us." She explained that the nurses are concerned about the residents' food intake, thus they readjust seating arrangements to enhance food consumption: "The staff were trying to find a spot for Mary, who was not eating well. But putting Mary and Edna together did not work. Edna left the table." In this case, the defining factor is the decision-making capability of Edna herself. She is mobile in her wheelchair and her cognitive abilities are intact, so she exerts more choice in her seating arrangements than many of her fellow residents. My Involvement in Decision Making Is Slipping Away: Interdependence Theme "They just came and told me … They don't ask you nothing. They just come and tell you what you are going to do." A changing pattern of interdependence, both across decisions and among decision makers, in negotiating transitions in Edna's decisional autonomy is illustrated by analysis of incidents pertaining to her medical treatment and health care. Decisions about Edna's health care, medicines, and needed diagnostic procedures became increasingly prevalent over the 15 months of the study. The pattern was consistent with a trajectory of growing decisional dependency as her health declined. The degree to which this represented a voluntary rather than an implicitly enforced trend resulting from benign concern on the part of staff is unclear. It emerged that decision making involved a progressively increasing degree of interdependency, both of actual decisions and among decision makers, in her decision-making constellation, as the various actors in Edna's life tried to adjust with sensitivity to her declining capabilities.During the first round of interviews, Edna was relatively healthy, according to most members of her decision-making constellation. But by the fifth round of interviews, Edna had experienced a kidney infection (resolved with antibiotics), a bout of pneumonia from which she did not seem to fully recover, and a period when she was obliged to wear an incontinence protective undergarment.One outcome of these episodes was that, after each one, it took Edna longer to return to her previous level of functioning. More important to the focus of this study was Edna's changing role in making decisions affecting her physical well-being as her illness episodes accumulated and her frailty increased. As time passed, Edna's involvement was marginalized as her autonomous daily health care decision making met with progressively less support and cooperation from other members of the decision-making constellation. This was exemplified at the time of a visit to her brother. Edna's nurse reported, "She refused her Lasix because she was going to her brother's and didn't know if she could get to the bathroom OK." Taking Lasix, being confined to a wheelchair, and getting quickly to a bathroom are not always compatible. Indeed, this presented a daily challenge for Edna. Consequently, she exerted her own decisional independence in deciding not to take the medication on this particular day. As the nurse said, "Edna flat-out refused." Had Edna still been in her own home, she most likely would have self-regulated her medication for this outing with her brother. However, in an institution in which adherence to medication orders is considered a priority, decision-making autonomy was viewed negatively as a "patient refusal" rather than an expression of independence.As Edna became more vulnerable as a result of illness episodes, her decision-making autonomy was increasingly threatened. Her need to take large doses of Lasix made it increasingly difficult to get to the bathroom without assistance and without episodes of incontinence. On the surface, the staff and Joyce tried to respect Edna's personhood, to treat her with dignity, and to sustain her decision-making autonomy as much as possible. Indeed, there was evidence of hesitancy and discomfort on Joyce's part as she tried to sensitively negotiate this situation and make a decision for her mother and yet maintain her mother's sense of autonomy.Mom complained about pain in her legs, and the doctor ordered massive doses of fluid pills. Mom was trying to get to the bathroom, but we were having accidents all over and she was getting a bit frustrated. So I talked to her. I suggested that maybe she might want to start wearing Attends, temporarily, until she gets so much fluid out of her.Joyce may have viewed wearing the incontinence protective undergarment as temporary. Yet, in all probability, given her declining level of cardiac functioning, Edna's ability to clear fluids was likely to become an ongoing challenge. The CNA most responsible for Edna's care also gave a supportive rendition of her role in gently negotiating this decision-making situation.I just tried to take care of it as professionally as possible because I know incontinence is, you know, kind of embarrassing, so … something to do with self-confidence … try to keep her from being embarrassed, you know, having to wear them. Dignity …It is important to acknowledge the magnitude of a decision to wear an incontinence protective undergarment. In many respects, it represents a turning point widely recognized at Elizabeth Manor as a marker of dependency. It is significant that Edna never mentioned wearing incontinence protective undergarments although she did admit, "I had the flu. I was very sick and got IVs. I didn't remember a lot of things. The doctors and nurses told me things."Understanding the delicate interdependence of people comprising Edna's decision-making constellation (including Edna herself) as they negotiate different situations is facilitated by viewing individual incidents within the broader context of the trajectory of her life as a resident of Elizabeth Manor. Individual decision-making incidents are part of a mosaic of interrelated changes that mark the resident's evolving status. Each decision involving Edna, in the benignly controlling cultural milieu of the nursing facility, was subtly related to every other decision because the same actors were generally involved. Moreover, each decision provides a template for framing subsequent decisions within the trajectory of a resident's life.For example, Edna's episode of pneumonia occurred after her room change. As the nurse reported,First, she got very sick. She had pneumonia. She needed IV antibiotics because she was so nauseated she couldn't keep the oral medication down. She was pretty bad for about 2 weeks … I think it all had to do with [her] room change and her sickness, because for a while we had to take her to the bathroom and Edna's always done that for herself. Well, now she's gotten back to where she's taking herself to the bathroom and she's not wearing Depends anymore, so I think it was a temporary thing due to her sickness and all that room change.Another factor contributing to Edna's pneumonia and to her physical decline was identified by Joyce. "She started wearing Attends, about 1 month ago. It was soon after Mrs. Baumhover's death." Mrs. Baumhover was a resident with whom Edna had developed a strong friendship. She had stayed at Mrs. Baumhover's bedside for days while she died. Joyce and the CNA were the only members of her decision-making constellation who reported on this experience. As Joyce expressed,She sat with her … In those last days I think Mom spent most of the time holding her hand and talking with her. The night Mrs. Baumhover died, Mom told me they wanted her out of the room but she told them no, that she was on her side, and they had the curtains closed and she held her hand. It was really sweet, you know. I told her, I said, sometimes, Mom, we don't know where we're placed—that maybe we're there for a reason. And Mrs. Baumhover's daughter was sick and her granddaughter could not be there, so after the death she got this touching note from both the daughter and the granddaughter.As the CNA noted, "The death of Mrs. Baumhover was very hard on Edna." She attributed Edna's decline in health and her pneumonia to difficulties coping with her room change, the stress of the last days of her relationship with Mrs. Baumhover, and associated strain on her adaptive capabilities. I'd Rather Know What Was Going On: Awareness Theme "I'd rather know what was going on." Another decision-making incident associated with Edna's physical decline and change in the nature of her interdependence with those around her involved the deterioration of her eyesight. As Joyce explained,She started, probably in April, mentioning that she was having some trouble seeing with this, this left eye. But she was going to wait till I got out of school [Joyce is a schoolteacher] before we did something about it. Then I think the first of May she was noticing a noticeable difference. She talked to the [physician assistant] … and the next thing I know she had an ophthalmologist appointment for May 19.What occurred at this appointment provides a clear illustration of the subtle, sometimes unknowing ways in which decisional autonomy is wrested from nursing facility residents as their frailty increases. Edna was very pleased with the ophthalmologist. He took lots of time to explain to her, in the presence of her daughter, what was going on with her vision. When she asked about surgery for the cataract on her "good" eye, the ophthalmologist indicated that this could wait a while. He gave Edna a chart she could look at to determine if she was experiencing further deterioration and suggested that he be called immediately if significant change was noted. This level of concern was greatly appreciated by Edna. But she had not been given the complete story. What the ophthalmologist reported separately to Joyce was that her mother was experiencing macular degeneration in the good eye, too, and in a matter of time would completely lose her sight in that eye as well. This example of withholding information was perhaps well intentioned but reflects the manner in which decisions began to be made without the involvement of the nursing home resident. This incident is especially poignant because Edna herself was aware of the degree to which decision-making autonomy was being benignly removed from her as she became more frail and vulnerable. As she noted on more than one occasion, "I'd rather know what was going on." Discussion In this case study, we identified features of the processes whereby decisions were made affecting the quality of life of a single nursing home resident. These decisions were made within a specific physical and cultural space—the nursing facility—that supported an implicit, often taken-for-granted decision-making milieu. Decisions affecting Edna were made in the context of a constantly evolving interdependency between Edna and those who surrounded her. Each member of Edna's decision-making constellation had a different level of awareness (or lack of awareness) of her needs and aspirations. Each, including Edna herself, held a different view of the relative importance of particular choices affecting her life. Each held a different image of her capabilities. And each was involved, to a differing degree and with a differing level of intensity over the course of time, in the various domains of her life at Elizabeth Manor.Our strong impression is that all the people involved in Edna's life at Elizabeth Manor had her best interests at heart. Their involvement in decisions, however, sometimes more reflected of institutional, professional, and personal norms and expectations than fully informed understanding of Edna's wishes.Within this rubric, our descriptive analysis provides insight into the manner in which decision-making processes in nursing facilities contribute to progressive surrogacy as resident frailty increases. In most cases, this process is benign. It embraces change, often a gradual and subtle movement toward increased dependency in the interdependent relationship between the resident and members of his or her decision-making constellation (Lowry 1989   ). Such a transition is appropriate when the resident is cognitively impaired or becomes increasingly impaired over the course of residence. In such cases, there is generally clear evidence of an individual's inability to make decisions with respect to specific domains of life.Our analysis of Edna, who was not cognitively impaired except for a brief period during an episode of pneumonia, suggests that removal from decision-making autonomy may be a generic feature of nursing facility life. In spite of increased awareness of the perils of "total institutionalization" (Goffman 1961   ), it appears that an ethos of benign progressive surrogacy and the erosion of resident autonomy remains ingrained in nursing home culture in ways unrelated to cognitive functioning (Agich 1993   ; Kane and Caplan 1990   ; Lidz, Fischer, and Arnold 1992   ).However, erosion of resident autonomy related to cognitive functioning is not ethical and must be challenged. There is realization and justification of the importance of resident autonomy in decision making. Programs to enhance caregivers' sensitivity to residents' concerns (Kelly and Lazaroff 1993   ) and models to create a community of caring that is autonomy enhancing (Roth and Harrison 1994   ) are examples to catalyze change. Even though respect for autonomy is realized and acknowledged, action is not always initiated. For example, Whitler 1996    reported that although nurses described specific ways to preserve and enhance personal autonomy, they did not use these strategies in their daily practice. However, bridging this gap between awareness and action is critical to preserve autonomy in elderly individuals. It is hoped that this case study about Edna will become part of this catalytic change so that institutionalized elders can remain autonomous as much as they are able for as long as possible.There are limitations with respect to the degree to which case study findings that reflect Edna's experience can be generalized to the complete sample of 64 constellations involved in our study, or inform us about nursing facility populations in general. For example, during our interviews elderly residents may have become fatigued to the point that they were not able to give a full account of the intricacies of their decision-making experiences. Edna and the other residents, as well as the other individuals in their decision-making constellations, may not have recognized all of the decisions (both implicit and explicit) that were actually made. The data almost certainly do not capture the full array and subtle complexity of all possible decisions affecting each resident. Participants may also have felt that it was more relevant to focus on major life and death decisions than to go into everyday decisions, even though such decisions may have been important for their quality of everyday life. Further in-depth case studies of individual nursing facility residents and their involvement in decision-making situations could considerably add to the body of knowledge about decision making in a nursing facility. Such studies should also focus on those who are cognitively impaired.Even in the absence of such studies, Edna's case provides a mirror of broad concerns regarding the conduct of institutional life by clearly demonstrating that although she was competent and cognitively intact, her decision-making autonomy was not fully acknowledged. The staff and Edna's daughter did make attempts to involve Edna, to listen to her. But Edna's voice was not heard and was not viewed as a critical element of decision making affecting her life. This is a reflection of the propensity of most nursing facilities to remain institution rather than resident centered (Happ, Williams, Strumpf, and Burger 1996   ; Lustbader 1996   ).A shift in orientation toward a person-centered philosophy allows the experiences and preferences of residents with regard to decisions affecting their lives to be more widely and routinely acknowledged and integrated within the daily life of nursing facilities (Evans 1996   ). Future directions in individualized care might include a willingness to more readily acknowledge the face-value legitimacy of cognitively intact residents' statements and requests. Even if residents are compromised in some aspects of their self-responsibility and decision-making capability (e.g., with regard to financial matters), they should still have a say about what they wear, where they sit at meals, and how their possessions are arranged in their rooms. It is critical to acknowledge that decisional impairment is a multilevel concept; residents may remain fully capable of making decisions in some domains of their lives although decision-making ability in other domains may be compromised. Moreover, as Capitman and Sciegaj 1995    noted, even persons with cognitive or psychiatric disabilities have life-long habits of self-care and continuing preferences about daily tasks that may make the indignities often associated with professional care even harder to endure. Such habits can be mapped and explicitly incorporated into care plans (Happ et al. 1996   ). Such mapping may be facilitated by consistent staff assignment to specific residents, allowing aides to develop awareness of each resident's capabilities and potential and enabling them to work out idiosyncratic ways of getting things done in a manner consistent with residents' abilities and preferences (Lustbader 1996   ).Most important is the need to assiduously work toward the creation of decision-making environments in nursing facilities that explicitly establish an ambiance of supportive and consultative interdependence. Rather than kindly paternalistic care that reinforces learned dependency, there is a need for an ethos of care focused on maximizing individual potential. Vogelpohl, Beck, Heacock, and Mercer 1996   (p. 42) found in their study of dressing behaviors that "caregivers contribute to loss of functional performance and dependency in cognitively impaired persons when they ‘do for,’ that is dress the person instead of supporting independence in dressing." Kayser-Jones 1996    emphasized the importance of an individualized care-oriented milieu for eating.By educating nursing assistants on how to provide individualized care at mealtime and ensuring that an adequate number of staff are available to assist those who need help, mealtime rather than being a task oriented procedure will be an individualized, pleasant social event. (Kayser-Jones 1996   , p. 31)Staff education initiatives that reinforce internalization of a basic orientation toward listening to residents, toward hearing what they say, and toward maximizing their decisional autonomy also offer the prospect of a more resident-centered nursing facility environment (Roberto, Wacker, Jewell, and Rickard 1997   ; Smyer and Allen 1999   ). However, the reality of the staffing situation must be acknowledged. The barriers of low staffing ratios, high turnover, and diverse educational, cultural, and language backgrounds often overwhelm efforts toward education and sensitivity to decisional autonomy.It is necessary to remain especially mindful of the fact that residents must have full say in the medical procedures and treatments that are rendered to them, except in circumstances where they are decisionally incapacitated. The most stringent criteria should be used in limiting decision-making autonomy in this domain. Thus, Edna's professed reluctance to undergo additional gastrointestinal testing or to have further surgery becomes the highest value, a value to be overridden only under extreme circumstances where the unequivocal benefit—to Edna—of such procedures can be clearly established. In contrast to such an ethos, current emphasis on the management of behavior has focused entirely on the control of disruption rather than on the promotion of resident strengths and abilities.When the focus is taken off of controlling residents and instead placed on empowering residents, both staff perceptions and residents' capabilities are seen in a different light. This view allows for the empowerment of the individual, who is no longer seen as helpless and needing to be controlled. (Lantz et al. 1997   , p. 555)The essence here lies in a crucial distinction between being informed and being consulted. All too often, Edna was informed about what was to happen to her in circumstances where she was clearly able to express a preference. All too rarely was she consulted and provided with the opportunity to have meaningful input into decisions affecting her life. Gradually, invidiously, and inexorably, she was rendered powerless and alienated as the ambiance of a perversely beneficent decision-making environment in which she found herself moved along the path of progressive surrogacy at a rate more rapid than was warranted by her increasing frailty. Notes Although we did not collect information on residents whose stay was anticipated to be brief, we presume that those who were in a facility for rehabilitation and recuperation from an acute illness episode may have had more decisional autonomy. Their expected release from the nursing home and return to independent or somewhat independent living may have given them increased status and power in decision making. On the other hand, if the individual was admitted to the nursing home at the end stages of life, decision-making capacity would most likely be limited.In addition to the principal investigator and co-principal investigator, four graduate assistants were involved in the derivation of decision-making categories, in conducting interviews, and in participant observation. Each graduate assistant spent 10 hr per week in the facility to which he or she was assigned over a period of 3 years.

     Abstract Purpose: The aims of this study were to assess the factor structure, reliability, and validity of an existing Resident Satisfaction Questionnaire (RSQ) and to develop a short-form RSQ for regular use in residential aged care settings. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted to collect the required information, with facilities being selected using stratified random sampling. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a sample of 1,146 residents in 70 residential aged care facilities in Western Aus-tralia. Results: The RSQ is confirmed to be a reliable, valid, context-relevant, and easy-to-use instrument for assessing residents' satisfaction with their residential aged care facilities. Resident satisfaction, as assessed via the RSQ, was found to be a multidimensional construct comprising six factors—Room, Home, Social Interaction, Meals Service, Staff Care, and Involvement. Implications:A 24-item short version of the RSQ can be constructed based on the six-factor resident satisfaction measurement model and used as a regular monitoring tool of resident satisfaction for quality improvement purposes.   Long-term care ,  Quality ,  Questionnaire ,  Reliability ,  Validity Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe quality of aged care is a fundamental concern for elderly people and their families, as well as policy makers at both state and federal levels. With the aim of improving quality of residential aged care in Australia, the federal government developed and introduced outcome standards (31 grouped under seven broad headings) in 1987 for nursing homes (Gibson 1998   ). Subsequently, outcome standards (25 grouped under six broad headings) were also introduced for hostels in 1991. A hostel is a low-care facility in which residents are more independent and receive personal but not nursing care. These standards have been used as a basis for the external monitoring and assessment of residential aged care facilities by the federal government. However, this system did not systematically take residents' views and satisfaction into consideration, so residents were not being given full opportunity to have their say or to participate in the provision and planning of their care.An Aged Care Structural Reform Package was introduced in late 1996 as an attempt to address these problems, and outcome standards were revised to reflect a number of changes within aged care provision. The resulting accreditation standards mainly build on previous ones, and embody a strong new focus on continuous improvement, which includes the requirement for appropriate resident input (Aged and Community Care Division 1998   ). Overall, the Australian federal government has moved toward a "partnership quality improvement process" with more of a focus on provider-initiated (proactive) management systems and on incorporating the views of residents. However, despite resident input having been formalized as a key aspect of the new accreditation process for residential aged care facilities, no specific approach has been prescribed for how residents' views can best be incorporated into the service delivery process (McDonald 2000   ). Resident satisfaction surveys provide one such approach (Boldy and Grenade 2001   ). Clearly, residents' assessments of the quality of care of the services they receive will play an increasingly important role in the provision of aged care. Measuring Satisfaction Most of the existing approaches to measuring satisfaction with health care services relate to hospital and acute health care, rather than to long-term or residential aged care (Davis and Bush 1995   ; Pascoe and Atkinson 1983   ; Rubin, Ware, Nelson, and Meterko 1990   ; Ware and Hays 1988   ). Of the few relevant aged care studies identified, resident satisfaction is not often the primary focus (e.g., Namazi, Eckert, Kahana, and Lyon 1989   ; Pearson, Hocking, Mott, and Riggs 1993   ). Moreover the focus of interest has usually been general life satisfaction (e.g., Thomas and Hayley 1991   ) or broader aspects of quality of care (e.g., Phillips-Doyle 1992   , Phillips-Doyle 1995   ; Rhys-Hearn 1986   ). Other researchers adopted resident satisfaction measures specifically for nursing home residents based on an existing satisfaction instrument that was originally designed for acute care, for example, the Satisfaction with the Nursing Home Instrument (SNHI; Ryden et al. 2000   ).One of the primary problems associated with the measurement of satisfaction relates to its conceptualization, in terms of the dimensions to be measured and specific issues to be explored. Other problems include ignoring the measurement properties of an instrument, such as its reliability and validity (e.g., Pearson et al. 1993   ; Thomas and Hayley 1991   ; Weihl 1981   ), using a summated or averaged overall satisfaction score (assuming all items have equal contribution to the latent construct and ignoring its multidimensional nature; e.g., Kruzich, Clinton, and Kelber 1992   ), and using only a global overall satisfaction item (e.g., Duffy and Ketchand 1998   ). These issues are discussed further below. Relevant Context Schneider 1991    noted that one of the common problems with consumer satisfaction measures is that customers are asked to respond to questions that are contextually irrelevant. Hence it is critical that the measurement of customer service quality perceptions (such as customer satisfaction) is targeted to the specific service facets that are relevant for that particular market segment.It is clear that the dimensions covered must be relevant and important to the care recipients. For example, in high care facilities (nursing homes) it is irrelevant and inappropriate to ask residents if the discharge planning is appropriate; a more relevant question might be whether the staff members are responsive and friendly. The relevant service facets in nursing home facilities, as compared to high technology hospitals, are obviously quite different. Therefore, a generic satisfaction instrument cannot be applied across different types of health care settings, such as acute care and aged care. Consultation With Consumers Lack of consultation with consumers themselves, in the initial identification of the dimensions and issues to be incorporated within an assessment instrument, is another common issue (Carr-Hill, Dixon, and Thompson 1989   ; Freytag and Rossiter 1986   ; International Hospital Federation 1988   ; Kelman 1976   ; Lebow 1983   ). Focus groups have been suggested as a means of incorporating consumers' points of view (Dickens, Browning, Jellie, and Thomas 1993   ) and for identifying the words, concepts, and language of clients as a basis for developing questionnaires (Strasser and Davis 1991   ). This approach was adopted in a recent Australian project in the development of a resident satisfaction assessment package (Boldy and Grenade 2001   ). Multidimension Nature of Satisfaction. Although there is increasing consensus that satisfaction with health care is a multidimensional construct (e.g., Avis, Bond, and Arthur 1995   ; Dickens et al. 1993   ; Lebow 1983   ; Pascoe and Atkinson 1983   ), in practice many researchers still use a global "overall" satisfaction item or unidimensional measure. Levkoff and DeShane 1979    noted that the overall reaction to health care services is commonly used to represent the level of satisfaction, and discrete service components are frequently neglected or totally ignored. The obvious problem is that clients may rate a health service overall as satisfactory even though they may not be happy with some specific components (Corrigan 1990   ). Elwell 1984    also noted that high standards of cleanliness, safety, and health, for example, may not be necessarily related to beautiful features, diversional activities, or other quality-of-life indicators. It is clear that only limited information can be obtained from a single "overall" item. Importance of Measurement Properties Lack of validity and reliability testing of satisfaction measuring instruments is another major criticism in the health arena (Ware and Hays 1988   ). Issues of measurement error are also rarely addressed, and only few researchers have empirically assessed measurement properties of their questionnaires (Hall and Dornan 1990   ; Rubin 1990   ). A valid and reliable resident satisfaction instrument is therefore required to more accurately assess residents' satisfaction in residential aged care. The purpose of the present study was firstly to examine the dimensionality of resident satisfaction, via the Resident Satisfaction Questionnaire (RSQ) developed by Boldy and Grenade 1998   , and secondly to develop a reliable and valid short form RSQ for regular monitoring. Methods The primary purpose of developing the instrument was to use it in a study aimed at exploring the influences of various factors (resident, staff or facility related) on resident satisfaction. Hence we wished to include a wide variety of residents from a wide variety of facilities. As this article will show, we achieved such variety. Research Design A cross-sectional resident satisfaction survey was designed to collect information over a period of approximately 12 months (April 1998–April 1999) via a self-complete questionnaire (RSQ). An invitation letter with an information sheet, an overview of the proposed research, and an agreement form with a postage-paid reply envelope were mailed to all directors of nursing or managers of the selected facilities. A facility-specific report of the survey findings was offered to the participating facilities upon request. Sample and Procedure Selection of Aged Care Facilities A list of residential aged care facilities in Western Australia was obtained from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services. The sampling frame for the study included all private, public and charitable aged care facilities—a total population of 294 facilities with 12,012 beds. Stratified sampling was employed to ensure that a wide variety of facilities were included, by first categorizing institutions by size of facility, then by type and location. The size of the aged care facilities was divided into the following categories: small (≤ 30 beds), medium (31–59 beds), and large (≥ 60 beds). Facilities were categorized as "high care (nursing home)" and "low care (hostel)" and location according to "metro" and "nonmetro."When a refusal occurred, a replacement facility was selected randomly from the same stratum. Facilities were asked to nominate a coordinator to help identify eligible residents and assist in the distribution and return of the questionnaires. Selection of Residents To qualify for selection, a resident had to understand English, be sufficiently cognitively competent, have an energy level sufficient to participate in the survey, and have lived in the facility for more than 4 weeks. The staff or manager determined the eligibility of each resident based on the selection criteria and in consultation with the researchers. All residents satisfying the selection criteria were invited to participate.Residents were first informed by the facility manager or survey coordinator regarding the research activities approximately 1 week before the survey commenced. Residents were then either approached by the facility manager, survey coordinator, or the researchers. To minimize the tendency of respondents in satisfaction research to give overly positive responses (Jimmieson and Griffin 1998   ; Ware and Hays 1988   ), complete confidentiality and anonymity were assured via an information sheet given to each resident. Such assurance was also stated clearly on the first page of the questionnaire. This is particularly important because of the acknowledged reluctance of older people to criticize services on which they are dependent (Goldberg and Connelly 1982   ; Pearson et al. 1993   ).Where possible, residents completed the questionnaire themselves. If assistance was needed, help was offered, either to read the questions aloud for residents or to assist with completion. Alternatively, families, friends or volunteers could also be invited to assist residents. Approximately two thirds of participating residents required some form of assistance. Although it could be argued that providing such assistance could bias responses, survey coordinators strongly emphasized to all individuals who assisted (family, friends and staff) that the questionnaires should be completed based solely on the residents' view. The specific issue of possible influence of assistance on responses is addressed later, under resident demographic characteristics.The strength of permitting resident assistance is that a wider range of residents were able to participate (see later), particularly those with a mild degree of cognitive impairment, as was strongly desired. A "passive consent" approach was adopted; that is, if participants completed the questionnaire and returned it, this was taken to imply that they consented to participate. Measurement Instrument: RSQ The RSQ is part of the resident satisfaction assessment package developed by Boldy and Grenade 1998    for assessing residents' satisfaction in aged care facilities. This package was developed based on a review of relevant literature and extensive consultations with service providers and consumer representatives in a wide range of residential aged care facilities (covering both nursing homes and hostels) around Australia.A focus group approach, involving as many as 129 residents chosen so as to represent as wide a range as possible, was used to identify relevant and important dimensions from the residents' perspective, which then formed the basis for the self-complete questionnaire. The RSQ consists of 10 dimensions—namely, moving to the home (settling-in process), the resident's room, the home, passing the time, social life, links with the community, resident services, staff care, resident involvement, and other issues. A 3-point scale response (no = 1, depends = 2, yes = 3) or 4-point scale response (poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, excellent = 4) format was used for the 50 items. All "unsure/can't remember" responses were coded as missing values. An overall rating item, using a 4-point scale response, was also included at the end of each dimension (Boldy and Grenade 1998   ).Content validity of the questionnaire was addressed by testing and refining the instrument several times. Facility staff and administrators were also consulted as part of the instrument development and testing process. Feedback from a variety of "stakeholders" (industry and consumer groups) was also taken into account. Interrater reliability was found to be acceptable (Boldy and Grenade 2001   ). The resident satisfaction manual gives more detailed information regarding the instrument's theoretical background and scale development (Boldy and Grenade 1998   ). Exploratory Factor Analysis Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was first used to summarize the factor structure of resident satisfaction contained in the observed variables (items). The analysis was performed based on the principal axis factoring (PAF) method with varimax rotation on the correlations of the observed variables, using SPSS (SPSS, Inc 1999   ). Weak items (i.e., loadings < 0.3), or items that cross-loaded on two different factors and had a loading of > 0.3 on the second factor, were deleted from further analysis. The context and meaning of items were also taken into account during the process. Confirmatory Factor Analysis Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the viability of a hypothesized structure that had been formulated from theoretical considerations and results of the EFA. CFA was conducted using LISREL (Joreskog and Sorbom 1999   ). Satisfaction scores for each dimension were obtained using factor score regressions generated from the CFA as proportional weights to combine item scores.In addition to theoretical and practical considerations, assessment of model adequacy was based on the following goodness of fit criteria. Normed Chi-square (χ2/df) < 3, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < .05, non-normed fit index (NNFI) > .90, the comparative fit index (CFI) > .90, the goodness of fit index (GFI) > .90 and the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) > .90 (Byrne 1998   ; Joreskog and Sorbom 1999   ; Kline 1998   ; Schumacker and Lomax 1996   ). Results Response Rate In total, 1,378 resident questionnaires were distributed within 70 facilities. Of the 1,378 residents, 22 (1.6%) refused to participate and 207 (15%) did not return their questionnaire. Three participants were excluded from the analyses due to missing data amounting to more than 50%. The final total of 1,146 represents an overall response rate of 83.2%. Approximately two thirds of the participants were from the 40 hostel facilities.Due to confidentiality, it cannot be determined whether residents who did not return the questionnaire differed from the participants in any systematic way. Response rates were improved by implementing extensive follow-up procedures within each facility (e.g., reminder notices given out by the survey coordinator at resident meetings and via notice boards and announcements during meal times) about 10–14 days after the distribution of the questionnaires. Resident Demographic Characteristics The resident sample comprised 284 men and 849 women. Residents ranged in age from 45 to 103 years, with a mean of 83.2 years (SD = 8.7). The majority of residents were female (75%), born in Australia (63%), spoke English as their first language (94%), and had their own room and bathroom (65%). Overall, 39% of study residents had lived in the facility for more than 3 years. Thirty-seven percent were assessed as "high care," which includes some residents with a mild degree of cognitive impairment.The 37% of residents who were born overseas is demographically comparable to that of all residential aged care facilities in Western Australia (36.5%; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 1998   ). This fact, together with the high resident response rate, means that any resident response bias is likely to be minimal.Although 72% of residents required assistance to complete the questionnaire, help was mostly provided by family and friends. Staff provided assistance for 11% of residents. As it was anticipated this might happen in some facilities, and to minimize any undue influence, the survey coordinators were asked to ensure that all the questionnaires were completed based solely on the residents' view. The overall satisfaction item "Taking everything into account, how would you rate the home?" was used as an indicator to assess whether there was any association between "who filled out this questionnaire" and resident satisfaction. No significant association was found between these two variables, χ2 (6, N = 1123) = 10.07, p = .122, providing some evidence that residents' views had been reasonably captured and did not vary according to whether anyone assisted them in completing the questionnaire. Exploring the Factor Structure of Resident Satisfaction The sample size of 1,146 residents is sufficient for the required EFA. Most items were found to be only minimally skewed or kurtotic. A considerable number of item correlations also exceed .3. The Bartlett test of sphericity (χ2=20456, df=1225, N=1146, p=.00) is significant and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy is .95, which justifies proceeding with factor analysis (Coakes and Steed 1997   ).Ten factors were extracted with eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for 51.2% of the total item variance. Loadings of variables on factors, communalities, and percentage of variance explained are shown in  Table 1  , with loadings under .3 omitted to facilitate interpretation. According to the scree plot and percentage of variance explained, the last four factors may be dropped. The extracted 10 factors are: Factor 1 (Staff Care): This first factor comprises 10 items and accounts for 10.07% of the variance. The 4 items specifically designed to measure staff care loaded heavily on Factor 1, although a number of items from other dimensions tend to load or cross-load on this factor.Factor 2 (Meals Service): Seven items have their highest loadings on this factor, accounting for 7.07% of the variance. These items are all derived from the original dimension of resident services. A number of items under this dimension also cross-load on Factor 1 (Staff Care), for example item v7as (staff help provided at meal times), v7b (cleaning), v7c (laundry).Factor 3 (Home): The third factor comprises 5 items and accounts for 6.43% of the variance. The item v3h (How would you rate the home as far as its overall design and amenities?) cross-loads on Factor 4 (Room).Factor 4 (Room): Four items load heavily on this factor, which accounts for 5.96% of the variance. Although 9 items were originally designed to measure the aspect of room satisfaction, some items shifted away to form new factors, namely Factors 8 and 9.Factor 5 (Social Interaction): Items from the following three domains (passing the time, social life and links with the community) tend to load on Factor 5, accounting for 5.88% of the variance. Item V6a (Do you go out as much as you would like?) cross-loads on Factor 6 (Resident Involvement).Factor 6 (Resident Involvement): This factor comprises 7 items, accounting for 4.97% of the variance. Item V9e (Overall, as far as opportunities to have a say and to be involved in things, how would you rate the home?) cross-loads on Factor 1 (Staff Care).Factors 7, 8, 9 and 10: These factors contain only 2 items each. Factor 10 includes some items which are concerned with overall satisfaction within each domain and tend to load on their original domain.Only the first 6 factors, accounting for 40.38% of the variance, and items V2c and V2e, were retained for the subsequent CFA. Resident Satisfaction Constructs and Dimensionalities The EFA results above, together with the evidence gained from previous research (Boldy and Grenade 1998   , Boldy and Grenade 2001   ), provided a guide for selecting items for each satisfaction component and specifying an empirically based factor structure. All satisfaction components were tested independently in the form of a one-factor congeneric model (Byrne 1998   ; Joreskog and Sorbom 1996   ). To keep the measurement model simple, only 3–5 observed variables (items) were retained per factor in the CFA. Items were excluded on the basis of relatively large measurement errors (> .5), weak factor loadings (< .5), high correlation between items (> .85), low item reliability (< .5), and large modification index or residual (> 2.58), following the recommendations of Kline 1998    and Byrne 1998   . The meaning and context of individual items were also taken into account. After deleting all "noisy" items, the selected 24 items were then tested jointly in the form of a one-factor model and a multifactor measurement model.Although it has been recognized that satisfaction is best represented by a multidimensional model, many researchers still aggregate all items to obtain an overall satisfaction score. This implicitly assumes that satisfaction is a unidimensional concept. The following analysis examines the appropriateness of such an assumption. Single Factor Satisfaction Measurement Model The one-factor model, whereby all 24 items were loaded onto a single factor "general resident satisfaction," was tested first.  Table 2  shows that the χ2 (252, N = 935) value (1367.55) is significant at the .001 level, although this is not surprising given the large sample size (935 cases with complete data). More informative is the χ2/df ratio, which for this model is greater than 3. In addition, the NNFI is less than .90 and RMSEA is greater than .05. Because three of the six criteria are not met, it appears that a one-factor, "general resident satisfaction" model does not fit the data adequately. Six-Factor Satisfaction Measurement Model The second model to be tested postulates a priori that satisfaction is a 6-factor structure, composed of ROOM, HOME, Social Interaction (SOCIAL), Meals Service (MEALS), Staff Care (STAFF), and Resident Involvement (INVOLVE).The various indices of fit shown in  Table 2  suggest that satisfaction structure can be adequately described by the 6 correlated factors which are graphically presented in  Fig. 1 . Latent constructs (satisfaction components) are shown as ellipses and questionnaire items measuring these latent constructs are represented as rectangles. Arrows pointing from the latent constructs (ellipses) to the observed variables (rectangles) exhibit the corresponding factor loadings. All loadings are greater than .5. Convergent and Discriminant Validity Convergent validity implies that observed variables measure a common underlying factor, and all have relatively high loadings on that factor (Kline 1998   ). As shown in  Fig. 1 , all factor loadings are greater than .5 and are significant at the .001 level, suggesting that convergent validity is supported.Discriminant validity refers to the distinctiveness of the factors measured by different sets of indicators (Kline 1998   ). Poor discriminant validity is evidenced by high factor correlations (> .85). Here, the estimated correlations among the 6 factors range from .558 to .802.A second-order factor was next fitted, with factor loadings for each of the 6 factors being presented in  Table 3  . Although the resulting GFIs are satisfactory (see  Table 2  ), the first-order 6-factor solution is preferred to measure the underlying domains of resident satisfaction and for the practical development of a short form RSQ. Reliability As can be seen from  Table 3  , the lowest level of satisfaction applies to resident involvement and the highest to staff care. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were computed for each of the subscales. As a rule of thumb, the alpha coefficient should be at least .70 for a scale to demonstrate internal consistency (Spector 1992   ). Coefficients for all satisfaction component composite variables are high (ranging from .81 to .90; see  Table 3  ), and only a few measurement errors are slightly greater than .5 (see  Fig. 1 ), suggesting that the observed variables are reliable measures of the underlying latent constructs.The test–retest reliability of the RSQ was also assessed. Two identical RSQs were administrated to 33 residents within a 2-week interval in one large hostel. The observed intraclass correlation coefficients range from .74 to .90 ( Table 3  ), suggesting that the RSQ has good test–retest reliability in hostel residents. Discussion Satisfaction Factor Structure via the RSQ The present study evaluates the factor structure of the RSQ. It provides empirical support for a multidimensional rather than a unidimensional resident satisfaction construct. The results indicate that the RSQ has six empirically derived dimensions—namely, satisfaction with room, home, social interaction, meals service, staff care, and resident involvement. Overall, this factor structure is consistent with the original structure of the RSQ instrument, except for aspects related to resident service and social interaction. Some items were found to have relatively low reliability and were excluded from the final measurement model.The 6-factor model via the RSQ is a psychometrically sound and valid instrument. Findings revealed good composite reliability and satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity. This represents an important contribution to satisfaction research in residential aged care settings, where a "good" tool is needed so that residents' views related to improving service quality and/or for the purpose of accreditation can be incorporated. It has added significant value to the resident satisfaction assessment package developed by Boldy and Grenade 1998   . Short Form RSQ Many participating residents commented that the RSQ is too long and some tended to get tired and frustrated, and lost concentration. For the purpose of regular monitoring, a valid and reliable yet shorter but comprehensive version of the questionnaire would reduce the residents' burden. Such a short form of the RSQ can be developed based on the 6-factor resident satisfaction measurement model. It will provide a practical and useful instrument for regular internal (e.g., in-house quality improvement) and external (e.g., accreditation) use. Multidimensional Versus Unidimensional Satisfaction Construct The superiority of the 6-factor over the 1-factor model implies that residents distinguish between different components of residential aged care services. Therefore resident satisfaction as assessed via the RSQ is best represented by six dimensions. The inappropriateness of applying a general resident satisfaction score is thus reinforced. This finding is congruent with the need for a multidimensional approach to resident satisfaction (Corrigan 1990   ). Limitations Various statistical criteria have been used to guide the selection of items for CFA. It should be emphasized that the meaning and context of individual items also needs to be taken into account in the selection process. Similarly, the choice of competing measurement models should not be based solely on statistical grounds. Some related discussion on model selection can be found in Breckler 1990   .The RSQ was developed based on the views of the residents in Australian aged care facilities. If the instrument is to be used in another country, then it would be advisable to undertake some sort of "pre-study" to assess whether the dimensions and questions included all relevant aspects, pertinent to that country's aged care resident mix. Implications Customer satisfaction can be viewed as an advance warning system (Bernhardt, Donthu, and Kennett 2000   ). The continuous monitoring of residents via the short form RSQ can detect early warning signals in terms of declining satisfaction scores on particular components. A facility can then choose to take action to reverse the decline before residents' quality of life and the facility's performance deteriorate further. Such a process has long-term benefits by reducing complaints handling and increasing employee retention, consequently saving the costs associated with hiring new employees (Bernhardt et al. 2000   ).Information from regular application of the short form RSQ could form the basis of a resident satisfaction database for quality improvement, identifying best practices, searching for most influential factors, and other management, research or policy purposes. The collection of information across different facilities would enable comparisons among facilities benchmarking for both short- and long-term planning. Therefore, further work and resources for the development of the short form RSQ is warranted, in terms of its layout, format, the flow of the question items, and instructions to complete the questionnaire.The Forum  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: Supportive services at home are essential for older people with severe chronic impairments. Newer "consumer-directed" models of organizing home-based services rely heavily on service recipients rather than home care agencies to arrange and direct care at home. This study examined differences in service experience and outcomes between recipients over and under age 65 who direct their own services in one large Medicaid program. Design and Methods: A random sample of 1,095 recipients of In-Home Supportive Services in California was selected and interviewed by telephone. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, and three Asian languages; those with severe cognitive impairment were excluded from the study. Results: Findings indicate that although younger recipients embrace self-direction more enthusiastically than older ones, age dif-ferences are small on a majority of service outcomes. On average, older users embrace this model and manage within it much like younger users. Some differences emerge between the young-old (65–74) and old-old (75+), but these are neither consistent nor determinative. Implications: Old age is far from an inevitable barrier to self-direction. As with other age groups, there are opportunities and obstacles to be addressed as this newer approach to home care is disseminated.   Home care ,  Consumer direction ,  Service outcomes Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe visibility of consumer-directed models for organizing services to people with supportive services needs has grown in recent years. Consumer-directed models are most common in programs targeted to persons with disabilities and generally involve services not considered highly skilled but rather social and supportive, particularly personal assistance and homemaker/chore services. Typically, this model permits or requires the recipient to recruit, select, hire, train, and supervise a home care provider(s) without the participation of a home care agency. Recipients in effect are small employers who hire (and fire) helpers and supervise their own service tasks. In turn, the provider is an employee of the recipient, not an agency, and thus has incentives to deliver services as directed by the recipient or risk losing the job. The provider is most often paid by an intermediary (e.g., a government agency or a contracted representative), although in the purest version, all funds are managed by the recipient (Batavia, DeJong, and McKnew 1991   ; DeJong, Batavia, and McKnew 1992   ).Significant federal, state, and foundation resources now support experiments in consumer direction and its integration into publicly funded service programs, most notably Medicaid's personal assistance benefit (Doty, Kasper, and Litvak 1996   ; Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1997   ). Until recently, there has been little rigorous research designed to understand the impact of this consumer-oriented approach to service delivery. New evidence suggests that the advantages of shifting responsibility for making most decisions about services implementation to recipients may well outweigh the disadvantages (Beatty, Richmond, Tepper, and DeJong 1998   ; Benjamin, Matthias, and Franke 1998   , Benjamin, Matthias, and Franke 2000   ). Less is known, however, about whether the age of the recipient of consumer-directed services is important to understanding the uses and impact of this model.Consumer direction has its roots in the "independent living" movement among younger adults with physical disabilities, and until the past decade was primarily seen as appropriate to young adults perceived to have the requisite commitment and energy to assume responsibility for their own services. Recent research on the experiences of elderly people raises important issues about variations by age in preferences for and experience with self-direction (Doty et al. 1996   ; Eustis and Fischer 1992   ; Hofland 1988   ; Kane and Degenholtz 1997   ; Simon-Rusinowitz and Hofland 1993   ; Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1997   ). Scholars have long been interested in autonomy and old age. A classic synthesis by Rodin 1986    suggests that, as people age, a sense of control may become more rather than less important and that opportunities for control are an essential element of well-being later in life. In the context of services to functionally impaired elders, however, traditional service models have emphasized vulnerability, dependency, medical instability, and the need for security as essential elements of service planning (Cohen 1988   ; Eustis and Fischer 1992   ; Glickman, Stocker, and Caro 1997   ; Scala, Mayberry, and Kunkel 1996   ; Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1997   ). Put differently, service planners tend to equate physical limitations with psychological and spiritual dependency among elderly people, and to focus on dependency based on functional limits in the absence of assistance, rather than on the potential for independence that may result from providing assistance.Other analyses of old age and self-direction suggest that among users of home care, younger clients are more likely than older ones to take charge of their services, but that perhaps a third of the elderly population prefer to substantially direct their care (Doty et al. 1996   ; Eustis and Fischer 1992   ; Simon- Rusinowitz et al. 1997   ). While there is some agreement that younger and older people with disabilities have different goals and experiences concerning consumer direction in home care, there is less consensus about preference variations by age when experience is the same. In other words, there is evidence that service users tend to prefer models with which they are familiar, and that consumer-directed options are more available to younger clients than to older ones. However, there is little evidence about whether and how age affects service preferences and experiences within program settings that permit consumer direction across age groups (Beatty et al. 1998   ).Recent findings from a federally funded study of alternative models for organizing personal assistance services in California suggest that recipients of consumer-directed services report either similar or more positive service outcomes than do recipients of agency-based services (Benjamin et al. 2000   ). These findings are surprising in light of widely held stereotypes of aging and disability that portray these populations as having little interest in or capacity for managing their own services. These findings, although limited to one large program in one state, challenge the argument that agency-based home care possesses obvious advantages over consumer-directed approaches to providing supportive services to disabled populations.When "recipient age" is introduced as one of a set of control variables in a multiple regression analysis of service outcomes, the results are ambiguous (Benjamin et al. 2000   ). For a majority of outcomes, age does not seem to be a factor in understanding service impact across models. However, we still know relatively little about whether (and how) age may matter among active users of consumer-directed services. Do elderly people find the experience of consumer direction more problematic than younger recipients? Do younger recipients experience more positive outcomes than older persons when directing their own services? Do the types of perceived benefits vary by age group? Are these relationships linear, in the sense that there is a pattern of experience clearly associated with advancing age? Put differently, do findings that a consumer-directed model yields more positive outcomes depend heavily on a "youth effect," by which most of the positive effects of consumer direction derive from its impact on younger users, one that might outweigh an indifferent or negative impact on older people? Or are positive outcomes distributed relatively evenly across the life span for those with disability, so that there is little or no age effect associated with the impact of consumer direction? Given that the concept of "outcomes" has many dimensions, is there an age effect on some dimensions but not others? If so, are there theoretical underpinnings that illuminate these variations? This study was designed to provide initial answers to these complex questions. Methods Setting The study setting was the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program in California, funded primarily under MediCal (Medicaid) with state and county shares. This program provides personal care, household, paramedical, protective supervision, and medical transportation services to about 200,000 low-income recipients of all ages (including children) with disabilities. At the time of the study, about 62% of recipients were older than age 65. Every prospective recipient receives an in-home assessment that determines levels of physical and cognitive impairment and need for assistance. Those assessed as eligible may receive up to 283 hours of services per month. State law mandates that IHSS services be provided through the consumer-directed model in all 58 counties, but counties have the option to contract for additional agency-based services (about one fourth do).County caseworkers, not consumers, decide whether eligible people are assigned to the agency model or the consumer-directed model. A majority of recipients live in counties that offer only consumer-directed services. The minority of counties offering both models typically assign to the agency option those who are socially isolated, are predicted to have difficulty finding their own provider, and need relatively few hours of service. This seeming paradox (consumer choice—whether one wants it or not) means that very little self-selection can occur. In addition, this program provides very few if any supportive services for those who need training and assistance in making consumer direction work (e.g., learning how to locate and hire an in-home provider). Importantly, the program does permit recipients in the consumer-directed model to hire anyone they choose as a provider, including family members (Benjamin, Franke, Matthias, and Park 1999   ). Because federal regulations restrict the hiring of spouses and parents of minors (Lewis-Idema, Falik, and Ginsburg 1991   ), IHSS draws on state and local funds to reimburse immediate family members.No program-wide provisions are made to meet the special needs of people with cognitive impairments. Counties vary some in terms of assisting new clients in initiating services, but while this is a very generous program in terms of potential service hours, it is a very lean one in terms of support for new clients. Furthermore, even in those counties with an agency option, it is clear that contract agencies in this program generally are not enthusiastic about serving those with cognitive impairments. Sample A random sample of 1,095 IHSS recipients was selected and interviewed using computer-assisted telephone interviewing between October 1996 and March 1997. The sample was drawn from a listing of all program recipients over the age of 18 in mid-1996. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, and three Asian languages (Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese). Non-English speakers using other languages, those under age 18, and those with severe cognitive impairment (as indicated in assessment scores on memory, orientation, and judgment) were excluded from the sample frame. Exclusion rates (for all reasons) differed little across age groups: under 65 = 30.6%; 65–74 = 33.9%; and 75 and older = 29.6%.The decision to exclude severely cognitively impaired persons merits further comment. Because the interviews were conducted by telephone, only proxies could be interviewed for this group. Pretest interviews indicated considerable overlap between proxies and paid providers in this program because close family members can be hired as workers. As much of the client interview addressed service experience and worker performance, we were reluctant to include either proxies who might be evaluating their own performance or (as an alternative) proxies too far removed from the client service experience. Data interpretation issues raised by this sampling decision will be considered later in the discussion of findings.The recipient sample was stratified by service model (consumer-directed, n = 511; agency, n = 584) and by age (over and under 65). In order to compensate for the fact that a majority of recipients received 20 or fewer weekly hours of service but that some received 100 hours or more, we also stratified by approved program service hours (over and under 20 hours per week), which serves as a rough proxy for service intensity and reliance on program services. The recipient sample for the consumer-directed model (CDM) was drawn from all 58 counties, and these 511 CDM respondents are the focus of this analysis.The recipient response rate was 77.8%. Sample respondents on average were younger (M = 64.6 years) than nonrespondents (M = 71.2 years), primarily because of higher refusal rates among those over age 75. (Refusal rates for the age groups <65 = 14.7%, 65–74 = 23.4%, and 75+ = 28.7%.) Although we have only limited data on the functional status of nonrespondents, that group averaged fewer service hours (implying less assessed service need) than did respondents despite having slightly more severe cognition scores. Measures Three recipient outcomes were considered: Empowerment, Unmet Needs, and Service Satisfaction. First, supporters of consumer direction argue that recipients who direct their own services become more empowered in the process of designing and guiding their own care, and that this will be reflected in their preferences and experiences. Second, advocates argue that negotiation between recipient and chosen worker will yield better services and fewer unmet service needs. Finally, because recipients control the process of service organization and delivery, they should be more satisfied with various aspects of service provision. For this analysis, the central question is whether outcome patterns will vary by the age of the recipient exercising consumer direction. Items on recipient outcomes included 12 on recipient empowerment and 15 on recipient service satisfaction.Established measures were used where appropriate; in some instances, they were adapted to the study population and/or objectives. Items on Empowerment were adapted from the National Home Care Survey (Leon 1994   ) and from instruments developed by Eustis and Fischer 1992   , Kimmich and Godfrey 1991   , and Barnes 1995   . Unmet Need was assessed using measures developed by Allen and Mor 1995   , Allen and Mor 1997   . Service Satisfaction measures were adapted from those developed on medical outcomes by Davies and Ware 1988   , Davies and Ware 1991    and Marshall and Hays 1994   , Marshall, Hays, Sherbourne, and Wells 1993   , and from those of Leon 1994    and others on home care. The telephone interview instrument also included items about recipient demographics, functional status (Katz and Akpom 1976   ; Lawton 1971   ), mental and emotional status (Ware and Sherbourne 1992   ), IHSS service use, and informal and community supports (Kemper et al. 1988   ).Principal axis factor analysis was used to determine the underlying dimensions of Empowerment and Client Satisfaction. For Unmet Need, we used the two scales themselves, which are based upon activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), because the requirements for factor analysis were not otherwise met (Benjamin et al. 1998   ). Data reduction yielded 10 outcome dimensions: Empowerment = (1) service choice and satisfaction, (2) preferred role, and (3) client assertiveness; Unmet Need = (4) unmet ADL needs, (5) unmet IADL needs; and Service Satisfaction = (6) service technical quality, (7) provider shortcomings, (8) service impact, (9) general service satisfaction, and (10) provider interpersonal manner. Internal-consistency reliability ranged from 0.54 to 0.76 (Cronbach and Meehl 1955   ). All alphas were above the 0.50 criterion set for new instruments by Nunnally 1978    for group comparisons. Analysis All outcome analyses were done at the recipient level using multiple regression based on the general linear model. The analyses incorporated sampling weights and accounted for design effects (Kish 1967   ), using the Stata statistical software package (StataCorp 1997   ). As described, outcome dimensions were specified using factor analysis. Predictor variables included recipient demographics, recipient case mix, and service characteristics, including type of CDM provider (family, nonfamily). The inclusion of client characteristics is essential because many other features of the client and his or her condition, some of which may vary with age, may be directly associated with service outcomes. The inclusion of dimensions of service experience is based on the argument that the extent and content of home-based services will vary, and that these variations may affect reported outcomes relatively independent of client characteristics. All equations were run twice using alternative measures of client age: a simple dummy variable for young/old (−/+65); and a three-variable approach based on a contrast coding scheme, in which those aged 45–64, 65–74, and 75 and older, respectively, were compared with those under age 45. Because the results of the latter analysis added little to the former, we report only regression results using the young/old age variable, while commenting where appropriate on results from the more detailed approach. Results Data in  Table 1  describe the demographic characteristics of a statewide sample of 511 recipients who were directing their own supportive services at home under the Medicaid (MediCal in California) personal assistance benefit in early 1997. Because age was used to stratify the sample, the numbers of elderly and nonelderly recipients are roughly equal. Older program recipients are more likely than younger service users to be women, identify as ethnic minorities, have less than a high school education, and be widowed. Data in  Table 2  indicate that the older cohort is somewhat less impaired on ADLs than the younger one, whereas IADL differences between the two groups are negligible. The older recipients are more likely to report conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems, and the younger clients are more likely to be paralyzed and to use a wheelchair or other equipment. Because ADL limitations are more common among them, more younger recipients need assistance with paramedical tasks such as bladder and bowel care. Even with a sampling plan that excluded the most severely cognitively impaired, older users have slightly higher scores than younger ones (and thus more impairment) on assessed memory, orientation, and judgment.On basic features of the service experience (see  Table 3  ), there are some differences between the younger and older cohorts in the sample. Younger recipients receive more paid service hours through the program (because of their greater ADL needs), but they more often express discontent with the number of hours authorized. Most recipients in both groups currently have a single paid caregiver, but younger recipients are more likely to have more than one current provider. The age cohorts are very similar in terms of longevity in the program and with their current provider. They are also alike in the sense that about one in four had difficulty recruiting a provider (a task with which most county program offices generally provided little or no assistance). However, younger recipients are more likely to have ever replaced a provider.In a program in which recipients can hire anyone they prefer, the majority select relatives and friends as paid providers. However, younger recipients are more likely (78.8%) than older ones (68.5%) to have previously known their provider (either family member or friend). This difference masks one other distinction: Although younger recipients are much more likely to employ someone they know—a friend, acquaintance, or neighbor (36.9% vs 16.2%)—older users are more likely to hire a relative as a worker (52.0% vs 41.9%). In an apparent paradox, although older recipients report fewer family and friends on whom to rely for informal support (see discussion below), they turn more often to family members for paid assistance.Interestingly, younger recipients are more likely to share a home with their provider than are older ones (39.4% vs 28.5%). Neither group has encountered much language difficulty communicating with their providers; in fact, this is a much more pervasive problem for clients with agency workers (Benjamin et al. 2000   ). Strikingly, younger recipients are nearly three times as likely (41.8%) to receive extra (unpaid) service hours from their providers than are older users (15%).In this sample of people needing supportive services, older recipients report being less able than younger ones to rely on the help of family and friends (see  Table 3  ). More younger recipients (75.1%) have someone to turn to for advice about problems and issues than do older ones (66.4%). More younger users receive unpaid help from relatives and friends (46.8%) than do older ones (33.9%). Similarly, when sources of back-up service help are explored, younger recipients more often cite family and friends (71%) than do older users (58.7%), and older recipients are more likely to report no one available (22.2%) than are younger ones (17.4%). Age and Recipient Outcomes To understand age-associated outcome patterns, we first examined bivariate relationships between age group and dimensions of Empowerment, Unmet Needs, and Service Satisfaction. As noted, rotated factor analysis yielded three factors for Empowerment: service choice and satisfaction; preferred role; and client assertiveness. Along with age distinctions between the nonelderly and elderly recipients, we also examined differences between the younger and older elders. Weighted mean scores for the three dimensions of Empowerment by age category are reported in  Table 4  , first for those under and over age 65 (cols. 2–4), then for those elders aged 65–74 and aged 75 and older (cols. 5–7). (Column 1 shows the score ranges for each outcome.) On all three Empowerment dimensions, scores for those recipients aged under 65 are higher than for those 65 and older (higher scores indicate more empowerment), and on the first and third, these differences are statistically significant. The first outcome captures degree of perceived choice afforded by the consumer-directed model as well as the degree of satisfaction with that choice. Although absolute differences by age group are small, clients under age 65 report greater choice and satisfaction than those 65 and older. When scores within the over 65 cohort are examined (cols. 5–7), it is apparent that the difference is based on scores for those aged 75 and older; the score for those 65–74 is essentially identical to that of the under 65.The second dimension of Empowerment addresses preferences for training and supervising the worker; on this, age-cohort differences are not statistically significant. Finally, when recipients are asked to indicate how much they want a major say in service decisions, reported differences again are statistically significant, with younger recipients having higher scores. However, this young-old difference is not based on the experience of the 75 and older alone but reflects more pervasive characteristics of older service users.Unmet Needs were assessed in terms of the number of assessed ADL and IADL needs. There are minimal differences by age on unmet ADL needs. Although there are only slight group differences in IADL functioning levels (see  Table 2  ), older recipients report fewer unmet IADL needs (i.e., higher scores) than younger ones, and the difference is statistically significant. This result is not based simply on responses by the oldest-old, as differences are small between those aged 65–74 and 75 and older.On the five dimensions of Client Satisfaction, bivariate differences by age emerged on only one. For technical quality, general satisfaction, and interpersonal manner, there are no differences between younger and older service users (and none within the elderly cohort). When asked to assess the impact of the provider on getting things done inside and outside the home, users under age 65 are more positive than older ones about the impact of supportive services on their lives. Again, this difference reflects lower scores across both subsets of the older cohort. Outcomes Analysis Multiple regression analysis permits us to move beyond bivariate analysis and examine more carefully the relationship between age and outcomes while taking other characteristics of recipients and services into account. When demographic, case mix, and service experience measures are added to an equation that regresses age (+/−65) on the three Empowerment outcomes, age is a statistically significant predictor for both "service choice and satisfaction" and "preferred role," but no longer for "client assertiveness" (see  Table 5  ). For each outcome, those who are under age 65 have higher empowerment scores than those aged 65 and older. In the case of "preferred role," there are no specific variables that, when controlled, seem to account for the emergence of age as significant statistically. Rather, it seems to be the cumulative effect of a set of client descriptors that brings out differences by age. By contrast, "client assertiveness" differences that were statistically significant by age (see  Table 4  ) are no longer so when client characteristics (most obviously, ethnicity, paramedical needs, and confidence in back-up help) are included in the equation. When demographics, case mix, and service experience are taken into account, younger users experience a greater sense of empowerment than do older ones on two of three Empowerment dimensions.When age and other client and service measures are regressed on Unmet Need, the relationship between age and unmet IADL needs remains statistically significant. Age, however, is unrelated to reported unmet ADL needs. Recipients over the age of 65 report fewer unmet IADL needs (have higher scores) than do younger service users. A number of other client characteristics have statistically significant relationships with unmet IADL needs. Gender matters for both unmet ADL and IADL needs, with women reporting more unmet needs and men fewer (see Allen 1994   ). Those recipients with fewer providers in the past year (less turnover), whose provider lived with them, and who thought their authorized service hours were adequate, reported fewer unmet IADL service needs. A host of demographic and case mix characteristics (including number of ADL and IADL limitations) are related to number of unmet ADL needs, but age is not among them.With inclusion of demographics, case mix, and service experience in the Client Satisfaction equations, only the relationship between age and "service impact" remains statistically significant. This outcome dimension captures perceptions about the effect that in-home supportive services has on the ease of living inside and outside the home. When we compare "service impact" scores for those aged 65–74 and 75 and older ( Table 4  ), differences between elderly subgroups are small.When the same outcome equations were run again using the more complex coding scheme for age, the results were mixed. For one dimension of Empowerment (preferred role) and one of Satisfaction (service impact), comparisons between recipients aged 65–74 and 75 and older (respectively) and those under age 45 are not statistically significant, confirming the absence of significant group differences among elderly users on these outcomes, as noted in  Table 4  . However, for another Empowerment dimension (service choice and satisfaction) and for one Unmet Need dimension (IADL), scores for the oldest-old are lower than those of younger users and the differences are statistically significant, whereas differences for those aged 65–74 are not. Recipients aged 75 and older in a consumer-directed model are less likely to experience choice in designing and implementing their supportive services and are less likely to report unmet IADL needs than younger elders. Discussion The aim of the study was to understand the relationship between age and service outcomes for recipients within a consumer-directed program. Although data interpretation is constrained by some important study limitations, to be discussed, the data suggest several findings. First, on a majority of outcome measures (6 of 10), age differences between the old and young are not statistically significant, suggesting that age is not a uniform determinant of service experience under consumer direction. Second, elderly users consistently experience less choice than younger users in decisions about service provision and report a lower preference for self-direction. Third, elderly recipients report fewer unmet IADL needs than do younger recipients. Fourth, older persons more than others report that their personal assistance services have less impact on their lives. Fifth, when age-related differences are analyzed in terms of older and younger elders, those over age 75 are different from those aged 65–74 on two outcomes: They report lower service choice and satisfaction and fewer unmet IADL needs. For some outcomes, age differences within the elderly group seem important.In interpreting these findings, the limitations of the sampling strategy must be considered. Because recipients with severe cognitive impairment were excluded from the study sample, these findings can tell us nothing about the experience of this subset of disabled people. Among all recipients in the IHSS program, those assessed as severely cognitively impaired represent 11.8% of those under age 65, 2.4% of those aged 65–74, and 5.4% of those aged 75 and older. Given that nonrespondents were older and had slightly poorer cognitive status, there are added reasons to be cautious in generalizing these findings to the very old (and others) with severe cognitive limitations. This is especially true because the program provides little or no additional support or resources to these recipients and relies heavily on families, friends, and community-based programs to implement and monitor services.In light of these limitations, what do these results tell us about age as a determinant of client adaptation to and compatibility with a consumer-directed model of home-based services? Most obviously, the results are mixed. In this study population, age is important in some respects but not others. Although actual differences on service outcomes across age cohorts are not large, they are consistent in indicating that, on balance, older adults tend to be less enthusiastic about the experience of consumer direction than younger persons in the sample.Results for reported unmet needs are less easy to interpret, in part due to the nature of the outcome measures. Self-assessed unmet need levels are a function of actual need levels, the efficacy of services to address them, and client attitudes toward the potential for meeting them. In this analysis, one predictor of unmet IADL need is age, with those 65 and older reporting fewer unmet needs. When data for a comparison group in the same program of other clients being served by home care agencies are examined (data not shown), there are similar, statistically significant differences between age groups. These similarities across service models suggest that the organization of services (i.e., the relative presence or absence of consumer direction) is probably less important than the age of the recipient in understanding unmet IADL needs. Also, because users under age 65 are (a) more likely to have replaced a provider and (b) more likely to find these hours insufficient despite receiving more paid hours, they may be more inclined to challenge program authority and more willing than older clients to make their dissatisfaction known. No age (or model) differences emerge for unmet ADL needs.On most dimensions of client satisfaction with self-directed services, age differences have little effect on outcomes. For four dimensions of service satisfaction—technical quality of provider services, provider shortcomings, general satisfaction with services, and quality of the interpersonal relationship with the provider—there is no difference between younger and older recipients. Only on perceptions about service impact does age consistently matter. Younger recipients are more likely to report that provider services make their lives easier inside and outside the home. Because in this program recipients under age 65 have greater ADL needs, some of this difference may be a result of the more substantial benefits from personal assistance services experienced by those users most dependent on it. These differences between young and old could also result from what may be the lower expectations of disabled older persons about how easy life activities can become with advancing years, even with capable assistance.Interpretation of these findings on service impact should take into account the context of this research. Study data are drawn from a survey of actual users of consumer-directed supportive services at home. These users receive little assistance from the IHSS program in dealing with the demands of hiring, training, and supervising their workers. In this context, it is apparent that younger people with disabilities on average embrace the experience of directing their own personal assistance services more enthusiastically than do older recipients. Younger users are also more likely to complain that their needs are not being met, notably their IADL needs, while older users are more satisfied with their current services. For younger users (who have more ADL needs), the conviction that they do not receive adequate authorized service hours probably underlies their concerns about unmet homemaker-chore (IADL) needs. Despite their perception of higher unmet needs, however, younger service users nonetheless report that services make more of a difference in their lives.On the other hand, there are no statistically significant differences by age group on a majority of outcome measures, and even where differences meet this statistical standard, actual score differences are not large. This suggests that while consumer direction may be more appealing for younger recipients, older users embrace this model and are not much different from younger ones in implementing it. In another sense, these findings echo those of other scholars who have suggested that, at the least, a sizable minority of the elderly population is open to consumer direction and likely to make it work (Eustis and Fischer 1992   ; Simon-Rusinowitz et al. 1997   ). Our findings suggest that when assigned to a consumer-directed service arrangement, many older recipients (at least in one California program) receive the care they need on terms they can accept.Others have argued that one socially determined barrier to the dissemination of consumer-directed models to elders is the lower expectations of professionals, family members, and elderly people themselves about the capacity of older persons to actively manage their own services and to benefit from these (Simon-Rusinowitz and Hofland 1993   ). As suggested earlier, to the extent that this is accurate, it suggests another perspective on the findings from this study: Older recipients may not feel more empowered because they may expect relatively little from a more active role in the service relationship; older recipients may have fewer unmet needs because they feel they should be content with less and not complain; and older recipients may not experience service-related changes in their lives because, as they age, they may not expect to experience many benefits even from a helping relationship they have shaped.Others have also suggested that the younger-old may more actively embrace consumer direction than the old-old (Eustis and Fischer 1992   ), and our data provide some modest support for this. Differences between younger and older recipients on one empowerment measure (i.e., service choice and satisfaction) seem to be based primarily upon differences between elderly people aged 65–74 and those aged 75 and older. In this case, the younger-old look very much like those under age 65 in terms of their relative enthusiasm for consumer choice and its benefits. Differences on reported unmet IADL needs between the under and over 65 follow a similar pattern, suggesting either that providers somehow better meet the IADL needs of the older-old or that client expectations about what is required to meet homemaker-chore needs may become more modest as people age.Rather than debating whether or not consumer direction is appropriate for older people, we should be asking under what conditions are specific groups most likely to succeed in this model. For example, this study indicates that in a program in which anyone may be hired as a paid worker, elderly users are most likely to hire family members and somewhat more likely to hire strangers. Younger disabled users, in contrast, are nearly as likely to hire friends as relatives. The preference of older people for hiring family providers may be due to choice (e.g., they are more comfortable with a family member) or circumstance (e.g., there are few friends or strangers to draw on; recruiting workers is perceived or experienced as more difficult; the pool of available family members, although smaller, is more available to hire for this kind of work; and/or family members perceive caring for an older person to be more legitimate than caring for someone younger).Age differences in hiring family members become more salient when considered in light of "Independent Living" principles, the impetus for much of the recent growth in interest in consumer direction. Proponents of those principles typically argue that relying on family members (unpaid or paid) for supportive services undermines the independence of the consumer, because it may be difficult to supervise someone effectively when "blood ties" are involved. Thus, consumers may not be able to exercise their preferences and avoid dependency when service business and family relationships are blended. In this view, hiring workers with minimal personal ties reinforces the principles that the client is independent and that the provider is an employee of the client. Our findings suggest that hiring family members may be easier and more comfortable for consumers, especially older ones, particularly in a program that provides little hiring assistance to recipients. As consumer-directed programs become more common, it seems clear that older consumers want the option to hire family members with public funds, even as public policy debates about this continue (Blaser 1998   ; Simon-Rusinowitz, Mahoney, and Benjamin 1998   ).Independent Living advocates and others have acknowledged the need to adapt the consumer-directed model in at least two ways: (1), to include guardians or surrogates to assist in managing services for those with severe cognitive limitations; and (2), to provide training and support to consumers who are new to consumer direction (Sabatino and Litvak 1992   ). California's IHSS program accommodates surrogates who may be available for cognitively impaired clients, but it provides very little in the way of supportive services to clients, workers, or families encountering difficulty in implementing and sustaining consumer direction. Our experience with both older and younger clients suggests that this is the Achilles heel of this program. Older recipients may be especially vulnerable because they are more isolated socially, have fewer peers over time on whom they can rely, and may be separated geographically from family members. Specifically, our findings indicate that older recipients are less likely to have someone to turn to for advice and are less able to rely on informal or backup assistance from family and friends. The California program leaves much to chance as clients first become eligible for much-needed public services but then must chart their own course in locating a worker and implementing services. Recent efforts to establish worker registries in California counties are an overdue response to this issue. Summary Case managers, home care professionals, and others commonly argue that older persons face insuperable obstacles to managing their own supportive services. Our findings challenge this perspective and suggest that old age is far from an inevitable barrier to self-direction of supportive services in the home. Rather, aging with chronic health problems represents a set of opportunities and challenges that must be addressed as consumer-directed models become more common within long-term home care programs. One such challenge is to provide for the complex needs of those with severe cognitive impairments, whatever their age. The appeal of consumer direction seems broad and to involve relatively few important age distinctions. As a result, various federal and state agencies, foundations, and national aging organizations (e.g., the National Council on Aging and the National Association of State Units on Aging) are now actively engaged in developing planning and demonstration initiatives to extend consumer direction to elderly people. It is important to continue collecting and examining evidence about the experience and outcomes of self-directed services across the life span.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This research examined whether the frequencies of specific emotions are associated with major and minor depression in older primary care patients. Design and Methods: Older primary care patients (N = 146), prescreened with a depression questionnaire, completed a diagnostic interview and an emotions questionnaire. Results: Controlling for age, sex, and other psychiatric and medical illnesses, major depressives differed from nondepressed controls in nine emotions; minor depressives differed from controls in four emotions. Major depressives differed from the controls more in sadness, joy, and interest—but not anger, fear, or guilt—than in comparison sets of emotions. Minor depressives differed from the controls more in sadness and inner-directed hostility—but not guilt, anger, fear, joy, or interest—than in comparison sets of emotions. Implications: The frequencies of discrete emotions are differentially associated with major and minor depression; future research is needed to determine their specific diagnostic and treatment implications.   Major depression ,  Minor depression ,  Comorbidity ,  Late-life psychopathology Decision Edition: Laurence G. Branch, PhDDisturbances in emotion are central components of major and minor depressive mood disorders across the life span, yet few studies have specifically examined the emotional experiences of older, depressed people. Studying the relationships between emotions and mood disorders is useful, as it may help bridge the gap between theories of normal human emotion and theories of late-life psychopathology.Differential Emotions Theory (DET; Izard 1977   ), a general biopsychosocial theory that emphasizes discrete emotion states, suggests that maladaptive linkages of specific types or patterns of emotions with cognitive or behavioral systems that normally help their regulation may lead to depressive disorders. In addition, particular emotions, such as sadness, may become linked maladaptively with others, such as anger or guilt. DET suggests that depressive states tend to be characterized by particular patterns of discrete emotions. This viewpoint contrasts with the perspective that affective experience can be effectively accounted for by two broad dimensions, positive and negative affect, and that distinctions among particular emotions within each dimension are relatively unimportant (Watson and Kendall 1989   ). Izard 1977    characterized the emotion patterns of adult depressives in terms of the relative magnitudes of the reported intensities of various discrete emotions, but did not compare these patterns with those of control subjects. Later studies, in which the emotion patterns of depressed children and adolescents were compared with nondepressed control subjects, tended to corroborate the earlier patterns found in depressed adults, though irritability was more prominent in the children and adolescents (Blumberg and Izard 1985   , Blumberg and Izard 1986   ; Izard and Schwartz 1986   ). The present study extends this line of work by examining the patterns of emotions in elderly people with major and minor depression and comparing them with nondepressed controls.A more detailed description of the phenomenology of emotions in depressed older persons may contribute to earlier detection and treatment, which in turn may decrease morbidity and improve long-term course (Keller et al. 1992   ). Enhanced assessment is particularly needed because late-life depression is underdiagnosed and undertreated (Freeling, Rao, Paykel, Sireling, and Burton 1985   ; Ormel et al. 1990   ). Moreover, the phenomenology of depressive disorders may be less apparent in older than in younger persons (Alexopoulos et al. 1995   ; Gallo, Anthony, and Muthen 1994   ; Garvey and Schaffer 1994   ; Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Krishnan, and Sibert 1993   ).Another reason for examining discrete emotions in late-life depression is that the frequencies of discrete emotions may help distinguish normal mood states from major and minor depressive disorders. Although evidence suggests that subsyndromal depression is associated with morbidity and mortality (Broadhead, Blazer, George, and Tse 1990   ; Wells et al. 1989   ) and higher risk for subsequent major depression (Horwath, Johnson, Klerman, and Weissman 1992   ; Wells, Burnam, Rogers, Hays, and Camp 1992   ), the proposition that minor depression is a distinct psychopathological condition remains controversial (Angst and Ernst 1993   ; Remick, Sadovnick, Lam, Zis, and Yee 1996   ; Skodol, Schwartz, Dohrenwend, Levav, and Shrout 1994   ). In gerontology, these issues are especially salient because major depression is less prevalent in geriatric populations (Blazer, Hughes, and George 1987   ), but older persons endorse some depressive symptoms on questionnaire measures more frequently than younger persons (Mirowsky and Ross 1992   ; Newmann 1989   ; Zung, Broadhead, and Roth 1993   ), indicating age differences in clinical symptoms that are insufficiently reflected in the diagnostic criteria. Diagnosing depression in older medical patients is complex in part because the criteria include symptoms that may be caused by medical illness (Koenig, George, Peterson, and Pieper 1997   ). A more detailed understanding of the emotional experience of older depressed and nondepressed persons can help identify depression-related symptoms in older patients that are not directly attributable to medical problems.The frequencies and intensities of particular emotions may have prognostic and therapeutic implications. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association 1994   ) criteria for the melancholic features specifier for major depressive disorder include either loss of pleasure in activities or lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, along with several other symptoms. In contrast, the atypical features specifier includes mood reactivity as its primary symptom. Both specifiers have important prognostic implications. A systematic investigation of differences in the experience of a broad range of emotions may help to refine the criteria for such subtypes of depressive disorders and may help clinicians predict the likely course of their patients' depressive illnesses. Such understanding may also contribute to more effective, individually tailored psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for depression.Previous research has shown that older residents of a long-term care institution with major and minor depressive disorders differed from nondepressed controls in a variety of pleasant and unpleasant affective states (Lawton, Parmalee, Katz, and Nesselroade 1996   ). Specifically, major depressives differed from the controls in five pleasant (happy, content, warmth, interest, and energy) and five unpleasant (sad, depressed, irritated, annoyed, and worried) affects. The minor depressives (defined as dysthymics or depressive adjustment reactions) differed from the controls in reporting less happiness and contentment, and more depression, sadness, and worry. A study of an overlapping sample (Katz, Parmalee, and Streim 1995   ) classified the subjects as either major depressives, dysphorics (defined as reporting significantly depressed mood for 2 weeks or longer), or nondepressed controls. Each group differed from the other two groups in the Profile of Mood States (POMS; McNair, Lorr, and Droppleman 1971   ) factors of depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, tension, and confusion.These investigations help to provide a differentiated description of the affective states associated with major and minor depression in older persons. Whereas diagnostic assessments are made partly on the basis of the presence of particular emotions such as sadness and guilt, the dimensional measurement of their frequency is not synonymous with the categorical rating of their presence "most of the day, nearly everyday, for 2 weeks or longer" (American Psychiatric Association 1994   ). Moreover, diagnoses of major or minor depression do not require the presence of even these two emotions, and the degree to which they are present in older persons having either of these disorders remains unclear. Further research with older depressed patients is necessary to determine the frequencies of other emotions (Ekman 1993   ; Frijda, Kuipers, and ter Schure 1989   ; Izard 1977   ; Lazarus 1991   ), and to compare and contrast various emotions with each other in the magnitude of their relationships with major and minor depression. Previous studies have not determined whether particular emotions, relative to others, are differentially correlated with these two disorders in older persons. It is unclear whether all unpleasant emotions are similarly elevated in older persons with major or minor depression, or whether particular unpleasant emotions are especially prominent. It also is uncertain whether one or both of the emotions of joy and interest, which are treated jointly in one of the diagnostic criteria for the two disorders, are lowered in frequency in older depressed people.In the present investigation, older primary care patients with either major or minor depression were each compared with nondepressed patients in the self-reported frequencies of 12 emotions. Most older depressed persons are diagnosed and treated in primary care settings (Shepherd and Wilkinson 1988   ). DET (Izard 1977   ) provided the general theoretical framework and taxonomy. Basing its taxonomy on the ability of observers to distinguish characteristic facial expressions, DET distinguishes 11 basic emotions and a 12th, labeled inner-directed hostility. The latter composite emotion consists of a blend of anger, disgust, and contempt directed against the self and is posited to be prominent in depression. Finally, to compare different emotions in the relative magnitudes of their relationships with major and minor disorder, we examined whether differences between the frequencies of specific emotions varied as a function of the subjects' diagnosis. The associations between emotions and these diagnoses were examined while controlling for the effects of confounding variables: age, gender, and comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions.We had the following hypotheses:Consistent with related previous findings (Katz et al. 1995   ; Lawton et al. 1996   ), persons with either major or minor depression would differ from nondepressed controls across a broad spectrum of pleasant and unpleasant emotions.Based on the fact that sadness, guilt, and inner-directed hostility are reflected in the DSM-IV criteria for major and minor depression, these emotions would be related to major and minor depression more strongly than the average of a set of other unpleasant emotions (i.e., anger, fear, disgust, contempt, shame, and shyness).Based on related findings in previous studies (Garvey and Schaffer 1994   ; Katz et al. 1995   ), anger and fear would be related to major and minor depression more strongly than the average of a set of other unpleasant emotions (i.e., disgust, contempt, shame, and shyness).Based on the fact that lower joy (i.e., diminished pleasure) and interest are reflected in the DSM-IV criteria for major and minor depression, these emotions would be related to major and minor depression more strongly than surprise, which is not reflected in the DSM-IV criteria. Methods Participants (N = 146) aged 60 years or older were recruited from private internal medicine offices (n = 87) or from a freestanding, University-affiliated Family Medicine Center (n = 59) using sampling procedures detailed below. The 146 participants were classified into three groups: those with a current major depressive disorder (n = 13); those with dysthymic disorder (n = 1) or current minor depression, defined as meeting the research criteria for minor depressive disorder in the appendix to DSM-IV (n = 11); and the remaining participants who did not meet criteria for current or past episodes of major depressive disorder (n = 121). Two of the participants who were placed in the major depression group had both current major depression and dysthymic disorder. Participants in this study overlapped with those in other published studies (not cited to preserve anonymity).The final sample was selected from a larger number of patients from the primary care sites based on sampling procedures and their completion of several steps of data collection. To obtain an older sample that was enriched with persons having significant depressive symptoms, research personnel or office staff administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff 1977   ) to patients aged 60 and older arriving for scheduled appointments. The CES-D was completed by 949 patients (84%) who were asked and were sufficiently fluent in English to participate. Stratified sampling procedures were used to include patients with a full range of CES-D scores. Specifically, all subjects who scored 22 or above (n = 113) were asked to participate in the study, as were a random sample (n = 323) of those who scored below 22 (n = 836). Each week, a random number table was used to select potential subjects from those patients who scored below the cutoff on the screening measure during the previous week. The number that was selected depended on the number of patients screened and the availability of interviewer time. The cutoff of 22 was used because a receiver operating curve analysis found 22 to be the optimum cutoff for detecting major depression in older primary care patients (Lyness et al. 1997   ). This cutoff is consistent with unpublished data on the CES-D from a mixed-age sample collected at the University of Pittsburgh (Herbert Schulberg, PhD, oral communication, January 1994). Of 436 patients who were selected as potential participants in the study, 216 (50%) agreed to complete a diagnostic interview within a predetermined time-frame of one month. Subjects above the cutoff who participated in the interview (n = 56) did not significantly differ in CES-D scores from those above the cutoff who did not participate (n = 57). Similarly, those below the cutoff who participated in the interview (n = 160) and those below the cutoff who did not participate (n = 163) had comparable scores. Participants and nonparticipants could not be distinguished on the basis of age or sex (M = 71.50 years vs M = 71.37 years, not significant (NS); 62% women vs 70% women, NS; respectively).The diagnostic interview was conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised (SCID; Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, and First 1990   ), a validated and reliable instrument that depends on rater clinical judgment using all available sources of data including the patient's report, family report when available, and medical records to arrive at Axis I diagnoses. Raters, trained to administer all the measures used in the study, conducted the SCID and rated the severity of depressive symptoms using the highly validated, 24-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D; Williams 1988   ). A physician–investigator reviewed the primary care record for all subjects, along with all other available outpatient and inpatient medical and psychiatric records. The interviewer presented the results of the clinical interview at a weekly consensus conference of investigators, raters, and other research personnel. Consensus diagnoses on Axis I were assigned based on all available data (primarily the SCID, Ham-D, and record review). These diagnoses were used for placing subjects into the major depression, minor depression, or control groups for the present study. A focus of the consensus conferences was determining whether there was clear evidence that subjects met the DSM-IV symptom criteria for the various depression diagnoses, and on whether such diagnoses should be ruled out because of evidence that the symptoms had physical causes such as stroke or dementia. Based on the medical record review and other information collected in the SCID interview, the physician–investigator assigned a rating of overall medical burden using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS; Linn, Linn, and Gurel 1968   ). The CIRS is a reliable and validated (Conwell, Forbes, Cox, and Caine 1993   ) measure of pathology based on the sum of 5-point ratings of impairment for 13 independent areas grouped under 6 body systems.At the conclusion of the clinical interview, participants were asked to complete and mail back in a postage-paid envelope the Differential Emotions Scale-IV (DES-IV; Izard, Libero, Putnam, and Haynes 1993   ), a reliable and valid 36-item questionnaire measure of the frequencies of 12 emotions recognized in DET. In the instructions for the DES-IV, participants were asked to consider their emotions during the past week and indicate how often in their daily life they experienced each emotion. Each of the 12 emotions is represented by 3 items, such as "feel sad and gloomy, almost like crying?" (sadness) and "feel scared, uneasy, like something might harm you?" (fear). Items are rated on a 5-point scale: "rarely" (1), "hardly ever" (2), "sometimes" (3), "often" (4), or "very often" (5). Ratings for the three items representing each emotion are summed. In seven instances in which participants omitted one of the three items measuring an emotion, the score for the missing item was replaced by the average of the other two.Of the 216 patients who completed the diagnostic interview, 175 met the diagnostic criteria for inclusion in the study (no past or present schizoaffective or bipolar disorder, no major depression in full or partial remission). Of these, 146 (83%) returned the DES-IV. Patients with major depression in full or partial remission were excluded a priori from the analyses because it seemed likely these diagnoses might affect current emotional functioning, but their categorization in either the major or minor depression groups seemed inappropriate. Participants with current or past episodes of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder were excluded a priori for the same reason. Presence of other non-mood Axis I disorders was not an exclusionary criterion, partly because comorbid psychiatric disorders are common in late-life depression and excluding participants with such comorbidities would result in groups that were unrepresentative of the population of interest. Within the group with major depression, two participants had dementia, two had somatoform disorder, one had both sedative dependence and somatoform pain disorder, one had sedative dependence, one had delusional-paranoid disorder, and one had simple phobia. Within the group with minor depression, one participant had a somatoform disorder. Within the nondepressed group, three participants had dementia, one had organic personality disorder, one had social phobia, and one had somatoform pain disorder.Participants included in the study with either a major or minor depression did not significantly differ in age, sex, or Ham-D scores of depressive symptom severity from patients with either of these disorders who did not complete the DES-IV. Control subjects who were included in the study did not differ in age or sex from nondepressed patients who did not complete the DES-IV, but they had slightly lower Ham-D scores (M = 5.73, SD = 3.42 vs M = 8.00, SD = 4.84, t(137) = 2.48, p < .05). As 87% of the nondepressed patients completed the DES-IV, however, the mean of 5.73 was only slightly lower than that for the entire pool of nondepressed patients (M = 6.02). Control subjects who completed the DES-IV did not significantly differ in their CIRS scores from potential control subjects who did not complete the measure, but participants in the study with major or minor depression had slightly lower CIRS scores than the depressed patients who were excluded because they did not complete the DES-IV (M = 7.16, SD = 2.27 vs M = 9.73, SD = 2.90, t(34) = 2.87, p < .01). Results Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Sample  Table 1  describes the three groups in terms of mean age, the percentage who were male, the percentage with a non-mood Axis I disorder, and the mean CIRS scores. In the analyses to be reported, covariates were included to adjust for differences between the groups in these factors. Transformation of Emotion Scores and the Removal of Statistical Outliers In the analyses to be reported, a square root transformation was applied to the raw emotion scores in order to achieve acceptable homogeneity of variance. In addition, outliers whose standardized residuals exceeded three were removed from all analyses. The number of outliers removed from a given analysis never exceeded two. Statistical outliers are inconsistent with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) assumption of normally distributed errors, and tend to disproportionately influence the outcome of statistical tests. They may derive from a variety of factors, but it is difficult to know the reason with certainty in a given case. Their removal affected only two findings, and in these instances they will be discussed in further detail. Group Differences in Individual Emotions The descriptive statistics for the 12 DES-IV raw emotion scores for each of the three diagnostic groups are shown in  Table 2  . Prior to testing group differences in the frequencies of each of the individual emotions, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted to test for group differences in the set of 12 emotions (sadness, guilt, inner-directed hostility, fear, anger, disgust, contempt, shame, shyness, joy, interest, and surprise). In this analysis, the 12 emotions were the dependent variables; depression diagnosis was the independent variable; and age, gender, presence or absence of a concurrent Axis I diagnosis, and the CIRS were covar-iates. The effect of diagnostic group was significant (Wilks's lambda F(24,254) = 3.17, p < .0001).Next, hypothesis 1 was tested by examining group differences in the reported frequencies of each of the 12 emotions using separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs). In addition to the overall effect of depression diagnosis, Scheffé-adjusted t tests were conducted to examine the pairwise differences between the major depressives and the nondepressed controls, and between the minor depressives and the nondepressed controls, respectively. Due to the relatively small size of the two depression groups, pairwise differences between them were not examined. In each analysis, one of the 12 transformed emotion scores was the dependent variable, depression diagnosis was the independent variable, and the four covariates described previously were included.The ANCOVA F statistics for the effect of diagnostic group on the transformed emotion scores, controlling for the four covariates, are shown in  Table 2  . Supporting Hypothesis 1, the ANCOVAs indicated that there were significant differences among the three diagnostic groups for 11 of the 12 emotions. Only surprise, which may be hedonically positive or negative, was unrelated to depression diagnosis. Also shown in  Table 2  are the results of the Scheffé-adjusted group contrasts between the major depressives and the controls and the minor depressives and the controls.The removal of outliers affected two of the findings: The pairwise group comparisons between the major depressives and controls for disgust and contempt changed from marginally significant to significant after their removal. One control subject, who was removed from both analyses, had unusually high scores on most negative emotions, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. This subject appeared to have clinically significant depressive symptoms that were not captured by the diagnostic criteria, but also tended to be inconsistent in reporting emotions and symptoms across different instruments. Another control subject, who had dementia, was removed from the analysis of disgust. Group Differences in Patterns of Emotions We next examined the relative magnitude of the associations of the emotions with depression diagnostic group. As preliminary tests, two repeated-measures MANCOVAs were conducted to determine whether diagnosis group was (a) associated with any one unpleasant emotion more than another unpleasant emotion, and (b) associated with any one pleasant emotion more than another pleasant or hedonically neutral emotion. In the first analysis, the unpleasant emotions (sad, guilt, inner-directed hostility, fear, anger, disgust, contempt, shame, and shyness) were treated as dependent variables, and in the second analysis, the pleasant or neutral emotions (joy, interest, and surprise) were treated as dependent variables. In both analyses, diagnostic group was the main predictor, and age, gender, CIRS score, and presence or absence of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis were covariates. An interaction of diagnostic group with the within-subjects effect for type of emotion would indicate that at least one emotion included in the analysis was more strongly related to diagnostic group than another emotion. For example, if sadness and fear were rated as having similar frequencies in the control group, but as having different frequencies in the major depression group, it would be reflected by an interaction of depression group with the within-subjects effect for type of emotion, and would suggest that one of these emotions was more strongly related to major depression than the other. This interaction was significant both in the analysis of the unpleasant emotions, Wilks's lambda F(16,262) = 2.17, p < .01, and in the analysis of the pleasant emotions, Wilks's lambda F(4,274) = 2.84, p < .03.Having obtained these interactions of diagnostic group with type of emotion in the repeated measures MANCOVAs, Hypothesis 2 was then tested by conducting three separate ANCOVAs. In these analyses, the dependent variable was the mathematical difference between either sadness, guilt, or inner-directed hostility, respectively, and the mean of the remaining set of six unpleasant emotions (fear, anger, contempt, disgust, shame, shyness); the independent variable was diagnostic group; and the covariates were age, sex, CIRS score, and presence or absence of a nonmood psychiatric diagnosis. The results are shown in  Table 3  . They indicated that sadness and inner-directed hostility, but not guilt, were more strongly related to diagnostic group than the mean of the other unpleasant emotions. Pairwise group comparisons revealed that sadness distinguished both the major depressives (t[138] = 3.82, p < .0002) and the minor depressives (t[138] = 3.67, p < .0003) from the nondepressed controls more than the mean of the other unpleasant emotions. Inner-directed hostility distinguished the minor depressives (t[138] = 3.56, p < .0005), but not the major depressives (t[138] = 0.79, NS), from the nondepressed controls more than the mean of the other unpleasant emotions. Guilt did not distinguish either the major or the minor depressives from the nondepressed controls more than the mean of the other unpleasant emotions.To test Hypothesis 3, two further ANCOVAs were conducted in a parallel manner using difference scores as the dependent variables. One of these tested whether diagnostic group was more strongly related to anger than to the mean of the set of emotions comprising disgust, contempt, shame, and shyness. This hypothesis was not supported. The second tested whether diagnostic group was more strongly related to fear than to the mean of the same set of four negative emotions. This hypothesis also was not supported.To test Hypothesis 4, we conducted two more ANCOVAs to examine whether joy and interest, relative to surprise, were more strongly associated with diagnostic group. As shown in  Table 3  , diagnostic group predicted the differences between both joy and interest from surprise. Pairwise group comparisons revealed that relative to the nondepressed controls, the major depressives reported less difference between their frequencies of joy and surprise (t[138] = 3.46, p < .0007), and less difference between their frequencies of interest and surprise (t[138] = 3.09, p < .0024); however, the differences between these pairs of emotions were similar for the minor depressives and the nondepressed controls. Discussion Several limitations to this study should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First, the participants may not be representative of the broader population of older primary care patients, in part because a limited number of physicians' practices were sampled, and in part because the need to complete several phases of data collection may have deterred individuals with poorer emotional or physical health from participating. On the other hand, this is the only study to our knowledge to examine the emotions of older clinically depressed patients in a primary care setting, where most depressed elders are diagnosed and treated. The relatively small sample sizes for the major and minor depression groups in particular limited the representativeness of these groups, gave insufficient power to test pairwise differences between them, and may have limited our ability to detect other group differences in individual emotions or emotion patterns, though many hypothesized group differences were detected. Limited sample sizes and multiple tests also increase the possibility of type one errors. The presence of comorbid mental disorders, although typical in this population, might also have affected the group differences in emotions. Although this possible effect was controlled through the use of a single covariate, this control was limited. A covariate was not used to adjust for antidepressant treatment, in part because it would likely remove variance in emotion associated with depression diagnosis. Therefore, there may have been an uncontrolled effect of antidepressant treatment on the emotions, though probably in the direction of reducing rather than increasing group differences. Limitations of the measure of emotions should also be acknowledged. The DES-IV consists of only three-item scales for each emotion. Whereas previous findings (Izard et al. 1993   ), the alphas reported in  Table 2  , and other findings presented in this article suggest the scales have acceptable reliability and validity, replication of the findings with alternative self-report and nonself-report measures is needed. Extension of Previous Studies of Emotion in Late-Life Depression The results of this study complement previous studies by demonstrating that the reported frequencies of 11 emotions, many of which have not been examined previously in depressed older persons, were associated with depression diagnoses. While sadness was reported to be the most frequently experienced emotion in the major depressives, it often was accompanied by high frequencies of self-directed hostility, anger, disgust, and contempt. This suggests that major depression in older adults is frequently characterized by both inner- and outer-directed hostility. It is notable, however, that the reported experiences of outer-directed anger, disgust, and contempt were not prominent in minor depression. In the context of minor depression, therefore, an increase in these "hostile" emotions may signal the development of a major depressive episode, though further research is necessary to confirm this possibility.Whereas joy and interest significantly distinguished both the major depressives and the minor depressives from the nondepressed controls, these pleasant emotions were by no means absent in the two depressed groups. In fact, the major depressives reported that joy and interest occurred at moderate frequencies, and the minor depressives reported that they occurred at least as often as any unpleasant emotion. These findings should alert clinicians that major and minor depressive disorders, at least in older patients from primary care settings, are more characterized by an increase in unpleasant emotions than a decrease in pleasant emotions. Pleasant emotions, although decreased in frequency, are unlikely to be absent or rare. Whereas normal emotional experience was characterized by high frequencies of joy and interest and infrequent unpleasant emotions, major depression was characterized by moderate frequencies of joy and interest, and moderate to high frequencies of unpleasant emotions. These observations do not rule out the possibility, however, that there may be depressive subtypes that are characterized by diminished pleasurable emotions rather than an increase in unpleasant ones. These findings do suggest that the frequencies of the positive and negative emotions were relatively independent in their relationships with major and minor depression. The independence of positive and negative affects has been reported and discussed in other contexts (Diener and Emmons 1985   ; Larsen and Ketelaar 1991   ; Watson 1988   ).The results also demonstrated that major and minor depression are not uniformly associated with various pleasant and unpleasant emotions, respectively, but are associated more strongly with particular emotions than with others. Specifically, sadness distinguished both the major and minor depressives from the control subjects more than a set of other unpleasant emotions. Inner-directed hostility also distinguished the minor depressives, but not the major depressives, from the nondepressed controls better than other unpleasant emotions. Whereas guilt, anger, and fear were associated with having a depression diagnosis, these emotions were not more elevated in the depressed groups than were comparison sets of other unpleasant emotions. Because guilt is specifically included in the DSM-IV criteria for major and minor depressive disorders, the lack of a differential elevation of guilt relative to other unpleasant emotions is noteworthy, particularly in the context of other research suggesting the lack of prominence of guilt in late-life depression (Wallace and Pfohl 1995   ). Whereas joy and interest were reported to be more frequent than surprise by both the nondepressed controls and the minor depressives, this was not the case for the major depressives. This suggests that joy and interest are differentially reduced in frequency in major depression but not in minor depression.The findings in this older sample provided partial support for the views of DET toward emotional experience in clinical depression (Izard 1977   ), and suggest a refinement of those views. As postulated by DET, clinically depressed patients differed from the nondepressed controls across a broad spectrum of positive and negative emotions, and the groups differed in certain emotions more than others, most prominently in sadness. Also consistent with previous findings, inner-directed hostility and anger were notably elevated, though not necessarily significantly more than other unpleasant emotions. The specific pattern of secondary emotions involved in clinical depression seems to vary depending on the age of the sample, but further research is needed to bear this out. The present findings suggest that the relative degree of association of particular emotions with late-life depression varied depending on whether the diagnosis was major or minor depression. For example, inner-directed hostility was elevated relative to a comparison set of emotions in minor but not in major depression, apparently because several emotions in the comparison set were substantially more elevated in major depression than in minor depression. Similarly, the positive emotions of joy and interest were comparatively more reduced in frequency than was surprise in major depression but not in minor depression. These findings suggest that the severity of depressive illness (i.e., minor vs major depression) is associated differently with different emotions—in other words, is associated with the quality and tone as well as with the intensity of the overall emotional state. Future Research Although the present study clarifies the relations of discrete pleasant and unpleasant emotions with late-life major and minor depressive disorders, future research is necessary to examine the implications of these relations.Future studies are needed to examine whether a predisposition for "hostile" emotions such as anger, disgust, and contempt are risk factors for major depression or for longer duration, greater likelihood of recurrence, or greater risk for suicide. Further, possible mediators of the effects of emotions on clinical outcome variables, such as interpersonal conflict or cognitive processes, may be examined.Future studies are needed to test whether particular patterns of emotions in depressive disorders are indicative of the likelihood of responding to particular types of antidepressant medications or psychotherapeutic treatments or approaches. For example, mood disorders accompanied by high levels of fear or anxiety may respond relatively better to particular types of medications or psychotherapies than those not characterized by anxiety.Future studies are needed to investigate whether emotional experience is indicative of distinct causal pathways for late-life depression. For example, studies could examine whether secondary depressive disorders, those "due to a general medical condition" (American Psychiatric Association 1994   ), are characterized by specific patterns of emotions that are distinguishable from those patterns experienced in primary depressive disorders. A related issue is whether early-onset and late-onset depressive disorders are associated with distinct emotion patterns (Baldwin and Tomenson 1995   ; Conwell, Nelson, Kim, and Mazure 1989   ). As understanding of the neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms of mood disorders increases, individual differences in emotional functioning are likely to become important indicators of specific types of underlying dysfunction.

     Abstract Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop a short and a screening version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) that would be suitable across diagnostic groups of cognitively impaired older adults, and that could be used for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies. Design and Methods: We used data from 413 caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults referred to a memory clinic. We collected information on caregiver burden with the 22-item ZBI, and information about dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and the frequency of problem behaviors among care recipients. We used factor analysis and item–total correlations to reduce the number of items while taking into consideration diagnosis and change scores. Results: We produced a 12-item version (short) and a 4-item version (screening) of the ZBI. Correlations between the short and the full version ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and from 0.83 to 0.93 for the screening version. Correlations between the three versions and ADL and problem behaviors were similar. We further investigated the behavior of the short version with a two-way analysis of variance and found that it produced identical results to the full version. Implications: The short and screening versions of the ZBI produced results comparable to those of the full version. Reducing the number of items did not affect the properties of the ZBI, and it may lead to easier administration of the instrument.   Caregiver burden ,  Instrument ,  Screening dementia Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe 22-item version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI; Zarit, Orr, and Zarit 1985   ) is the instrument most consistently used in dementia caregiving research (Bedard, Pedlar, Martin, Malott, and Stones 2000   ). It has been used in a variety of research designs, to discriminate between study participants (e.g., Molloy, Lever, Bedard, Guyatt, and Butt 1996   ), and to measure change over time, resulting from the progression of the care recipient's condition (e.g., Bedard, Molloy, Pedlar, Lever, and Stones 1997   ), or from interventions aimed at reducing burden (e.g., Zarit, Antony, and Boutselis 1987   ). A significant advantage of the popularity of the ZBI is that results obtained across studies can be easily compared and synthesized.Most researchers use the full revised version (22 items) of the ZBI. This version evolved from the original 29-item version published in 1980 (Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson 1980   ). While the ZBI has excellent internal consistency (α = 0.83 and 0.89; Majerovitz 1995   ; Zarit et al. 1987   ), the length of the instrument may be a deterrent to its use in clinical and research environments. Whitlatch, Zarit, and von Eye 1991    presented a shorter 18-item version, but this version never enjoyed the widespread use of the full version.Hébert and colleagues proposed a shorter version based on 12 items (Hebert, Bravo, and Preville 2000   ). Both their version and that of Whitlatch and colleagues were based on a two-factor solution incorporating items relevant to role strain and personal strain. However, Hébert and colleagues proposed 3 items for the personal strain section, whereas Whitlatch and colleagues proposed 12. The numbers of items for the role strain domain were, respectively, 9 and 6. Of the 12-item version, 9 were common to the 18-item version. Both groups of investigators reported internal consistencies greater than 0.80 for the shorter versions.One important aspect that both teams were not able to investigate was the adequacy of their short versions for longitudinal studies (seeking to detect change). For instruments that will be used to detect change over time, it is not sufficient to document psychometric properties based on data collected at one point in time (Kirshner and Guyatt 1985   ). Hence, the development of a shorter version of an existing instrument should take into consideration data obtained over time if one of the projected uses of the shorter version is in studies evaluating change. Given that the ZBI is used in intervention and longitudinal studies, we must convince ourselves that shorter versions not only discriminate between individuals, but also are adequate to measure change over time. At present we have little information on the usefulness of the ZBI as a tool to measure change. Accordingly, we devised the present study to determine how well the ZBI items perform when stratified according to diagnosis, and when used in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. Using this information, we devised a new short version and screening version of the ZBI. Methods The data were obtained between 1989 and 1999 (inclusive) from primary caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment. All data were obtained on the first and second visits (approximately 6 months apart) to a memory clinic located in a university-affiliated teaching hospital in a large urban center. Family physicians and specialists referred individuals for the treatment of memory or behavior problems. Trained geriatricians gave a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al. 1984   ), or other type of dementia. Trained clinical nurse specialists collected relevant data for this report.Caregiver information, obtained separately from the care recipient, included burden (ZBI), care recipient's dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs), and behavior problems. The ADL scale used was developed by Lawton and Brody 1969   , and is further divided into a basic ADL (BADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). The frequency of problem behaviors was recorded with the Dysfunctional Behaviour Rating Instrument (DBRI; Molloy, Bedard, Guyatt, and Lever 1996   ; Molloy, Mcllroy, Guyatt, and Lever 1991   ). For all measures, scores were generated for baseline, follow-up, and the difference between baseline and follow-up, and for diagnostic subgroups (AD and others).Burden data were factor analyzed with a principal component analysis and varimax rotation. Item 22 from the ZBI was omitted because it represents an overall burden item. Separate factor analyses were conducted for each combination of assessment (baseline, follow-up, change) and diagnosis (AD, others). The number of factors retained was determined by examination of scree plots (Streiner 1994   ). The items for the short version were determined according to the highest factor loading and high item–total correlations for all six combinations of assessment and diagnosis. The four items composing the screening version were selected according to the highest ranking item–total correlations while respecting the factor weighting of the short version. Internal consistency was determined with Cronbach's alpha (Streiner and Norman 1995   ). Correlation coefficients were obtained with Pearson's method (Howell 1987   ). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the behavior of the short version to that of the full version. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 9.0.1 (SPSS, Inc 1999   ). Results A total of 413 caregivers contributed data to the analyses. The average caregiver age was 61.01 (SD = 13.85), and 258 (62.5%) were spouses of care recipients. These caregivers supported 297 (72%) care recipients with AD, and 116 (28%) care recipients with other forms of cognitive impairment. The average age of care recipients was 73.13 (SD = 8.14), and the average score on the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination was 20.81 (SD = 6.95). The majority of care recipients were women (243; 58.8%). Overall, the mean reported burden was 20.59 (SD = 15.64) at baseline, and 20.97 (SD = 17.35) at follow-up. Change scores, available for 238 caregivers of AD referrals and for 91 caregivers of other referrals, were normally distributed around the mean. The average change between baseline and follow-up was 0.35 (SD = 12.21).The factor analyses supported two-factor solutions (rotated factor loadings for each combination of assessment type and diagnosis are available from the corresponding author). Together, these factors explained approximately 50% of the variance for the baseline and follow-up assessments, and 30% for the change scores. In some situations, the factor loadings were good for all situations; in others they were more variable.Item–total correlations were computed and are shown in  Table 1  along with their ranking from the highest, and the scale's internal consistency. Generally, item–total correlations and internal consistencies were higher for baseline and follow-up data than for change data. For many items, the rank of the item–total correlations remained consistent across combinations of time and diagnosis (e.g., item 2). However, for some items there were serious discrepancies across combinations (e.g., item 14).Items for the short version of the ZBI were selected through a combination of high factor loading and high item–total correlations across all six situations. This process was done blindly to the results of previous investigators. The items chosen were 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 17 for factor one, and 19, 20, and 21 for factor two. The narrative equivalents of the item numbers are presented in the Appendix. The screening items were selected based on the item–total correlations while keeping the three-to-one item ratio between factors one and two. Accordingly, the top three items selected from factor one were 2, 3, and 9, and the top item selected from factor two was 19. Using baseline data, Cronbach's alphas for the short and screening versions were, respectively, 0.88 and 0.78. For the short version, Cronbach's alpha for the personal strain factor was 0.89, and it was 0.77 for the role strain factor. Burden values representing quartiles for the various versions are presented in  Table 2  . The cutoffs for the top 25% were 30, 17, and 8 for the full, short, and screening versions.As a first step to investigate the validity of the short and screening versions, we correlated these scores to the full version data. The correlation ratios and probability values are presented in  Table 3  . Correlations between the short version and the full version varied from 0.92 to 0.97 depending on the combination of diagnosis and time. Correlations between the screening version and the full version varied from 0.83 to 0.93.We then examined if the short, and screening versions behaved similarly to the full version when predicting burden according to care recipient ADL and behavior problems, and also according to the overall burden item (item 22). These correlations are presented in  Table 4  . In general, correlations between the burden score and other scales were higher for baseline and follow-up measurements than change scores. However, the magnitude of the correlations obtained for the full, short, and screening versions of the ZBI was similar.To further examine if the short and screening versions of the ZBI would lead to similar conclusions in future research, we examined congruence between findings obtained with a diagnosis by time ANOVA using the full ZBI and the short version. Specifically, we examined (a) if a main effect of diagnosis was present (i.e., caregivers of patients with AD had higher or lower burden than others), (b) a main effect of time was present (i.e., burden changed over time), or (c) a Diagnosis by Time interaction was present (i.e., the change observed over time depended on the diagnosis). Mean burden scores at baseline and follow-up, and according to diagnosis, were comparable given the maximum possible scores. Percent change scores reflected similar changes over time (upper section of  Table 5  ). The actual statistical results also provided similar results. With the full scale, we found no diagnosis main effect, no time effect, and a marginally significant (p < .10) interaction effect. The ANOVA with the short version confirmed the pattern found with the full version (bottom section of  Table 5  ). Discussion We developed a short version of the ZBI using data that combined several diagnostic groups and considerable caregiver heterogeneity (e.g., gender, relationship) to provide us with a generic instrument that could be used for all caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults. Furthermore, our goal was to produce a short version that would work well in cross-sectional and longitudinal situations.Our results show that strong factor loadings and item–total correlations at baseline do not necessarily translate into similar statistics for change scores. The ZBI versions proposed include items with acceptable values for both scores at specific time points and change scores. Correlations between the short and full versions proved excellent for both situations. When used at baseline, the correlations between the short and full versions were 0.96 for caregivers of individuals with AD, and 0.97 for others. Hébert's correlation between the short and long versions was 0.96. Our overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.88 at baseline is comparable to that of others (0.83 to 0.91; Hebert et al. 2000   ; Majerovitz 1995   ; Zarit et al. 1987   ). The Cronbach alphas for the personal strain factor (0.89) and role strain factor (0.77) were equivalent to those reported by Whitlatch and colleagues (0.80 and 0.81). Our short version may be a compromise between the short versions proposed by previous investigators (Hebert et al. 2000   ; Whitlatch et al. 1991   ). It has 7 items in common with Hébert's. Hébert's has 9 in common with Whitlatch's, and we have 11 in common with the latter.We tested the behavior of the new versions to ensure that their use in research would provide similar results to those obtained with the full version, whether we used the instruments as cross-sectional or longitudinal tools. The pattern and magnitude of correlations between the short and screening versions and ADL and behavior problems mirrored those obtained with the full version. Furthermore, when the short version was used with a two-way ANOVA, we obtained results identical to those produced with the full version, ensuring that utilization of the short version will not lead to spurious findings. These data confirm that the short and screening versions are adequate substitutes for the longer version.The results of our study are possibly generalizable to most caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment. The mean ZBI in our sample was similar to Hébert's, which was obtained from a representative sample of Canadian caregivers, but less than Whitlatch's, which was based on a convenience sample. Further, our sample size was roughly 30% larger than Hébert's, and twice the size of Whitlatch's. Nonetheless, caution should be used when using the versions proposed here in substantially different settings. Instruments designed with specific types of populations may not be suitable for other populations. It is generally desirable to ascertain that the psychometric properties are maintained with other target groups (Streiner and Norman 1995   ).For most situations requiring the measurement of caregiver burden, we propose that clinicians and researchers use the short version. In situations where the rapid identification of burden is desirable, the screening version could be used. However, the cutoff where one may conclude that the caregiver is under considerable burden is less clear. Using the top quartiles as indicators, one may identify high burden with a score of 17 on the short version, and 8 on the screening version. However, our data cannot be assumed as normative.Our work expands on prior work by considering diagnosis and change scores in the development of a shorter version of an existing popular instrument. Ensuring that the short and screening versions work well for different types of diagnoses is important. Furthermore, we believe the proposed instruments can be used for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies. However, the longitudinal results were obtained with repeated measurements approximately 6 months apart, and with a sample consisting mostly of spouse caregivers. Confirmation of the suitability of the short form with longer intervals and other subgroups of caregivers is desirable.As the quantity of research focusing on older adults increases, it is desirable to reduce the research burden we impose on study participants. Reducing the number of items in commonly used instruments is one strategy that has enjoyed considerable popularity. For example, the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, and Lum 1983   ) has been shortened from a 30-item instrument to a 15-item instrument without major change in its psychometric properties (Sheikh and Yesavage 1986   ), and now into a 4-item screening instrument for the visually impaired (Galaria, Casten, and Rovner 2000   ). The proposed 12- and 4-item versions of the ZBI give clinicians and researchers the opportunity to use an instrument that will reduce completion time without sacrificing validity.

     Abstract Purpose: Grief is an overlooked but important element of the caregiver experience. This study defines a model of caregiver grief to aid in clinical intervention and to support further research. Design and Methods: This study addressed the grief responses of 87 spouse and adult-child caregivers of patients with progressive dementia representing mild, moderate, severe, and postdeath. Questionnaire data and qualitative findings from 16 semistructured focus group interviews provide the basis for a descriptive model of anticipatory grief in dementia caregiving. Results: Significant differences emerged between spouse and adult-child caregiver groups as a whole and as a function of Clinical Dementia Rating impairment level. Caregiver grief was found to fluctuate between intellectual, affective, and existential poles depending upon current care demands and expectations. Implications: These findings suggest that anticipatory grief in dementia caregiving is "real" grief, equivalent in intensity and breadth to death-related grief.   Alzheimer's disease ,  Anticipatory grief ,  Caregiver stress Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDGrief is a universal human experience—we all suffer losses and feel the anguish that follows. While it may be true that grief finds its full definition in response to death, significant grief reactions emerge in response to other losses as well. Bearing witness, for example, to the gradual "death" of a loved one's memory and personal identity from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a unique form of grief associated with present and anticipated losses prior to bodily death. For all too many caregivers, the burden of this grief is carried alone without meaningful social recognition or support (Doka 2000   ).Although much is known about grief in response to death (Archer 1999   ; Meuser and Marwit 2000   ; Stroebe, Stroebe, and Hansson 1993   ; Weiss 2001   ), relatively little has been written about grief associated with progressive cognitive decline, as in AD. It has been suggested that anticipatory grief, if experienced openly and adaptively, can reduce the later burden of grief when a loved one dies. In other words, the "grief work" may be accomplished during the illness phase and be largely resolved when bodily death occurs. Research findings are at best mixed on this hypothesis (Rando 2000   ). In the case of cancer, where cognitive functions usually remain intact, caregivers and patients have an opportunity to discuss the impending death and offer mutual support. It makes sense that such processing might foster adaptive resolution of grief. In the case of dementia, however, cognitive decline makes it difficult, if not impossible, for patients and caregivers to grieve together. The issue of anticipatory grief with dementia is largely unexplored.The first significant reference to grief in the AD literature can be found in the caregiver handbook The 36-Hour Day: "Grief associated with a death may be an overwhelming experience in the beginning, and gradually lessen. Grief associated with a chronic illness seems to go on and on" (Mace and Rabins 1981   , p. 164.). In a November 1982 address to the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, Dr. Rabins added: "In the course of a dementing illness, the patient's family will experience a variety of emotions that vary over time. We conceptualize the process through which many families go as one of chronic grief" (Rabins 1984   , p. 374).Since then, only a handful of studies have examined this topic to varying degrees. In an early interview-based study of caregivers, Wasow and Coons 1987    uncovered a wide range of grief and loss responses that defied simple categorization: "All that can be said for sure is that the coping mechanisms for survival seem as infinite as the number of respondents" (p. 29). Their one consistent finding was the traumatic nature of nursing home placement for caregivers in their sample (which fostered feelings of guilt, regret, frustration, etc.).Hundreds of studies on caregiver burden, depression, stress, and coping have appeared in the literature since the early 1980s. Surprisingly few of these studies discuss grief to any significant extent. In 1991, Carol Farran and colleagues challenged researchers to look beyond a stress-coping paradigm and consider how personal suffering may influence caregiver outcomes (Farran, Keane-Hagerty, Salloway, Kupferer, and Wilken 1991   ). They interviewed 94 caregivers about their losses, regrets, and attitudes. Frequency counts revealed that grief reactions were commonly reported: loss of relationship (reported by 52% of their sample), mourning losses (42%), changing communication with the care receiver (32%), loss of freedom (31%), loss of future plans (30%), and observing care receiver's loss of mental capabilities (29%). Similarly, Bowd and Loos 1996   , in a study of 68 dementia caregivers, showed that "difficulty dealing with grief" ranked 10th of 30 care-related issues. Later, when Loos and Bowd 1997    asked caregivers to list the range of losses they faced, four grief-related themes emerged: loss of social and recreational interaction, loss of control over life events, loss of well-being, and loss of occupation. Pomeroy and colleagues noted that grief is a "universal response" to the devastating losses that emerge during dementia progression (Walker and Pomeroy 1996   , Walker and Pomeroy 1997   ; Walker, Pomeroy, McNeil, and Franklin 1994   ). Data derived from administering the Beck Depression Inventory to both caregiver and depressed samples suggest that caregiver grief is qualitatively different from typical depression (Walker and Pomeroy 1996   ).A few studies have attempted to look at caregiver grief at different points in the progression of the disease. One study of 60 spousal caregivers (Rudd, Viney, and Preston 1999   ) examined differential reactions for men and women. According to this study, caregivers who had already placed their loved one in a nursing home showed more sadness and guilt feelings than their home-care counterparts. The balance was the opposite for anger. Female spouse caregivers reported higher levels of anxiety, sadness, and anger than their male counterparts, suggesting a possible gender difference in caregiver grief responses. Bass, Bowman, and Noelker 1991    examined pre- and postdeath factors in grief among AD caregivers. They found that predeath appraisal of care quality (e.g., Mom is getting good/bad care overall) was inversely related to emotional distress after the death. In other words, a positive view of the care provided to a loved one with dementia may enhance grief-related adjustment later when this person dies. Mullan 1992    found additional evidence that predeath experience can have an impact on postdeath adjustment: "The sense of loss caregivers experienced while still providing care significantly affected bereavement adaptation. Those who experienced more loss before the death were less distressed after the death: they were less depressed and had a greater sense of mastery" (p. 680). These findings suggest that benefits may accrue from anticipatory grieving.Ponder and Pomeroy 1996    propose that there may even be a certain flow to grief over time during the caregiving experience. They administered the nondeath loss version of the Grief Experience Inventory (GEI) and their own Stage of Grief Inventory (SGI) to a mixed sample of 83 spouse and adult-child caregivers. They suggest that caregiver grief may flow over time in accordance with dementia progression: Denial → Over-involvement → Anger → Guilt → Acceptance. Viewing grief level (measured by the Despair Scale of the GEI) as a function of time since dementia diagnosis, they report a fluctuating course: high grief intensity through the first 2 years of caregiving, a drop in years 3–4, followed then by a rebound in year 5 and beyond. They interpreted this pattern and other findings to indicate a lack of acceptance and resolution of grief after many years of caregiving. Active grieving over time in the care experience may not ameliorate the burden of grief later on. This contradicts the beneficial anticipatory grief findings of Bass and colleagues 1991    and Mullan 1992   .Gilhooly and colleagues reported a linkage between anticipatory grief and social death (i.e., the point where the dementia patient no longer has a meaningful interpersonal identity). "The most interesting factor … comprised the caregiver's beliefs that it was as if in some ways their dementing relative was already dead, that their actual death would come as a blessing …" (Gilhooly, Sweeting, Whittick, and McKee 1994   , p. 36). For some caregivers, grieving losses during dementia progression may be more significant than postdeath grieving.From these studies, a picture of grief in AD caregiving is beginning to emerge, although it is still quite fuzzy. No studies to date have examined the differential impact of grief on the two main types of caregivers (i.e., spouse vs child), and only one study (Ponder and Pomeroy 1996   ) has looked at the fluctuations that occur over the course of dementia progression from diagnosis to death. Rigorous efforts to measure dementia-related grief and provide appropriate support to caregivers (and AD patients themselves) are sorely lacking.The current study attempted to fill these gaps by systematically investigating the grief responses of spouse and adult-child caregivers of dementia patients (mostly AD) in mild, moderate, severe, and deceased stages. The primary research questions address (a) the key characteristics of caregiver grief (e.g., denial, sadness) at each stage of dementia progression from mild to postdeath; (b) the differences and similarities between spouse and adult-child caregivers; and (c) the buffering effects, if any, of anticipatory grief. It was hypothesized that spouse and adult-child caregivers would demonstrate distinctly different patterns of grief over the course of dementia progression. Given that this was an exploratory study, the nature of these differences was not specified. The objective was to develop a stage-sensitive, caregiver-specific descriptive model of grief that could serve as a basis for developing a psychometric instrument to measure the full range of dementia caregiver grief responses. Method Participants Participants were recruited through the St. Louis Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) at Washington University's School of Medicine (the clinical research arm of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center [ADRC]), and by word of mouth. Of the 121 caregivers who initially expressed interest in the study, 87 completed the focus group phase (35 from MAP and 52 community volunteers). The remainder either dropped out (changing care schedules was a common reason) or asked to be included in the second phase of the study that could be completed at home. Forty-two spouse and 45 adult-child caregivers for dementia patients were assigned to one of 16 focus groups (8 for spouses, 8 for adult-children). Groups ranged in size from 2 to 9 participants, with 14 of the groups having 5 or more members. Demographic and care-related characteristics of spouse and adult-child caregivers are presented in  Table 1  . Procedure Participants were mailed a questionnaire packet consisting of a face sheet describing the study, an availability checklist for scheduling, and a Group Assignment Questionnaire (GAQ). The GAQ asked about demographic characteristics of the respondent and characteristics of the care situation (e.g., percentage of care provided). The GAQ also included the informant interview portion of the Clinical Dementia Rating interview (CDR; Berg 1988   ; Hughes, Berg, Danziger, Cohen, and Martin 1982   ; Morris 1993   ), a semistructured interview that helps a clinician determine a dementia patient's cognitive–functional impairment status (0 = normal, 0.5 = very mild, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The CDR measures six cognitive–functional domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal affairs). Scoring rules allow the clinician to determine specific domain scores and an overall functional impairment rating (Morris 1993   ). The assessing clinicians use their best judgment to arrive at CDR ratings. At the ADRC, where both patient and informant data are obtained, clinicians usually favor the family informant information unless clearly erroneous.Caregiver type and the CDR overall ratings (derived via a standard algorithm of the 6 domain scores) were used to determine focus group assignment. There were eight adult-child groups, two for each CDR level (1, 2, 3) and two for postdeath participants (n = 45). There were also eight spouse caregiver groups following the same pattern (n = 42). For subjects recruited through the ADRC (n = 35), patient/informant-based CDR scores from clinical assessments were available and utilized for these assignments. For subjects recruited from the community (n = 52), informant responses to the CDR interview (administered in questionnaire form) were utilized. Mean comparison of CDR ratings for each group (patient/informant and informant only) showed no statistical difference. This differential utilization of the CDR is consistent with ADRC clinician emphasis on informant data, as noted above.The packet also included the Anticipatory Grief Scale (AGS; Theut, Jordan, Ross, and Deutsch 1991   ) and the Many Faces of Grief Questionnaire (MFG; designed for this study). The AGS is composed of 27 grief-related items responded to on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Three items were excluded due to lack of face validity and unclear direction for scoring (e.g., "I feel close to my relative who has dementia"). The AGS was originally validated on a sample of 27 female spouse caregivers of dementia patients (alpha = 0.84; present sample: M = 61, SD = 13, alpha = 0.84). The MFG is a checklist of 51 symptoms and reactions commonly reported in the grief literature grouped by subheadings of Emotions (e.g., sadness, anger, longing for what was), Cognitions (e.g., disbelief, denial, negativity), Physical (e.g., lack of energy, weight gain/loss, sleeping too little/too much), Spirituality (e.g., questioning meaning of life, loss of faith, turning toward prayer/God), and Social (e.g., loneliness, feeling alienated, jealous of others without problems). Participants were asked to consider the presence or absence of each symptom in their current life (past 3 months only) and respond on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Total points for all items served as the final MFG score for grief analysis (present sample: M = 142, SD = 52, alpha = 0.93). Focus Groups. Focus groups were conducted on the premises of the ADRC at Washington University in St. Louis. There were two groups for each caregiver type (Spouse, Adult-Child) at each CDR stage (very mild–mild combined [CDR = 0.5–1], moderate [CDR = 2], and severe [CDR = 3]) and also post-death (Deceased). All groups were 2 hours in length; they were videotaped with the exception of the Spouse CDR 3b group, which was lost as a result of camera failure. Fortunately this was our smallest group, having just two members.Both investigators led each group and employed a semistructured interview that progressed through the following six areas: (1) Tell us something about yourself—your family, work, and interests; (2) What was your parent/spouse like before he or she became ill with dementia—work, interests, role in your life? (3) What were your reactions to the early recognition of dementia (to early cognitive changes, to the diagnosis)? (4) How has your life changed as a result of caregiving? What have been the major losses? (5) Would you characterize your experience as a grief experience? How have your grief reactions changed over time? and (6) What do you expect will be (or has been) the impact of early grieving on later adjustment to death?A relatively fixed time frame was managed for each area of questioning. All groups ended with a debriefing and with a request for permission to possibly contact members in the future to collect longitudinal data. Participants were paid $50 for their involvement in the focus group process. Data Analysis. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were employed. Quantitative analyses included descriptive statistics, mean difference comparisons (t tests, chi-square), and correlations. Qualitative analyses were conducted with the assistance of a panel of 11 health professionals (2 psychologists, 4 social workers, 2 nurses, 2 hospice/pastoral care workers, and 1 health administrator) and 3 undergraduate psychology students trained by the investigators. Members of this panel were divided into teams to review tapes and to provide descriptive narratives of each of the 15 available videotapes utilizing an outline similar to that in the Appendix, which presents a shortened version. Each rater viewed up to three videotaped sessions. At least three independent ratings were obtained for each Caregiver Type × Stage subset (Spouse—CDR 1, 2, 3, Deceased; Adult-Child—CDR 1, 2, 3, Deceased).Major consistent themes and illustrative comments from these raters' narratives were compiled by the investigators and used to develop a summary narrative for each subset. The summary narratives for Spouse and Adult-Child CDR 1, 2, and 3 form the basis for a descriptive model of grief over the course of AD; the summary narratives for Spouse and Adult-Child Deceased (D) provide the basis for assessing the impact of anticipatory grief (i.e., does prior grieving influence postdeath reactions?). Results Quantitative The GAQ and other measures were administered primarily to aid in focus group assignment. Some of the quantitative findings from this effort are interesting and potentially meaningful, but small sample sizes may limit their validity and generalizability.Means comparisons between adult-child and spouse caregivers (all levels of dementia combined) showed significant, but understandable, differences in age (spouse > adult-child), education (adult-child > spouse), and % of care provided (spouse > adult-child). Spouse and adult-child caregivers demonstrated similar levels of reported grief, CDR impairment, and disease-related scores.Although spouse and adult-child caregivers achieved similar total scores on the MFG, mean comparisons on individual items revealed some statistically significant differences in grief emphasis. Child caregivers had significantly higher scores on jealousy of others, negativity, loss of interest in usual activities, and questioning the meaning of life. In contrast, spouse caregivers showed greater loneliness and loss of sexual intimacy. These differences largely make sense in light of potential life stage and social network differences between the spouse and adult-child groups.Correlation data are presented for the combined sample and for each caregiver subgroup (see  Table 2A  ,  Table 2B  B, and  Table 2C  C). Of interest are significant negative correlations in all three tables between MFG scores and years since dementia diagnosis (−0.45, p < .01) and sum of CDR box scores (−0.40, p < .01), suggesting that overall grief level declines over dementia progression. In contrast, the AGS, for the combined sample, correlates inversely with years since diagnosis but not with CDR box scores, and does not correlate at all with either specific caregiver type. Qualitative Findings—Grief Narratives of Active Caregivers Analysis of focus group discussions proceeded from raw data (the videotaped sessions) to individual summary narratives by multiple independent raters to combined summary narratives focusing on prominent (repetitive) themes for each caregiver type at each CDR stage of dementia progression. What follows are abbreviated combined summary narratives for active caregivers, starting with adult-child CDR stages 1, 2, and 3, and followed by spouse CDR levels 1, 2, and 3. See the heading for each narrative below for the number of subjects interviewed for that stage.  Table 3  captures and visually compares the essential elements of these six narratives which encompass the caregiver experience from mild to severe stages. Adult-Child Caregiver (CDR 1, Mild, n = 10). The grief experience of this caregiver group can be characterized as an approach–avoidance conflict. On one hand, these adult-children acknowledge their relatively new status as caregivers, and do so primarily by seeking information and making concrete care-related decisions. On the other hand, they noticeably avoid discussing the current and future emotional devastation facing both themselves and their parent. They tend to remain intellectualized, task-oriented, focused exclusively on their parent's competencies and strengths, and appear to avoid talking about emotions. In addition, they tend to underestimate the burden that lies ahead. They share, somewhat abstractly, their wish for their parent to die soon, but they avoid talking about the inevitable trials and tribulations between now and that time. The "underestimation" or "minimization" of change is manifest in seemingly casual or "lighthearted" discussion of the transformations taking place. Yet, when directly confronted, they can acknowledge elements of grief such as fear, helplessness, hopelessness, anger, and jealousy of other more fortunate adult children of healthy parents or of parents with less disabling diseases; also they will describe initial feelings of burden such as loss of personal freedom and having to put future plans on hold. Grief is not expressed when talking about the parent who "is," but emerges when asked to describe the parent who "was." It is then that the contrast of trying to retain an image of the good and competent parent along with the sadness of the disappearing parent becomes prominent, and again exemplifies the approach–avoidance so characteristic of this phase.The overall sense is that this group is beginning to experience grief but is struggling hard to contain it. They attribute the disease to "aging," "life phase," or being part of some other condition, such as depression. For the most part, this group stays present-oriented and positively focused. One gets the impression that they are scared, on the verge of emotional devastation, but still well defended. Their approach–avoidance conflict is manifest in the struggle between acknowledging the devastating emotional reality of their situation and denying the same.Also discussed was the ripple effect throughout the adult-child's own family. For a few, the parent's early decline has brought relationships closer, but for most, it has produced conflict and feelings of abandonment (especially by siblings), resulting in what one member referred to as "double grieving." These feelings were related mostly with sadness and disappointment, not anger. It appears that emphasizing issues in the extended family facilitates denial by providing a focus for intense feelings that might otherwise be expressed toward the parent. Adult-Child (CDR 2, Moderate, n = 12). For Adult-Child CDR 2 caregivers, the defensive denial of stage 1 gives way to a powerful recognition of personal loss and the inevitability of parental decline. The true impact of AD can no longer be avoided as care demands mount. Feelings are quite raw at this stage, with frustration and anger leading the way and guilt not far behind. Grief is focused largely on what the caregiver has lost. Said one distraught woman: "I was forced in one day to quit my job and go get her. I'm grieving more for myself and the loss of my life. I'm 43 years old and I can't leave my house."Caregivers at this stage take on a certain "siege" mentality and escapist thoughts begin to emerge ("if only I could get away"). Tremendous energy is focused on just making it through the day with little cognitive reserves available for instrumental coping. This stage may represent a peak in anger and frustration for adult-child caregivers. Anger is directed at the disease process, at personal losses, and, for some, at their demented parent. Although established parent-child patterns may continue at this stage, any pretense of normality disintegrates into talk of failure and frustration. A palpable fatalism and pining sadness appears to set in.By Stage 2, longstanding parent–child roles become reversed, and adult-children are making important life decisions for their demented parents. Nursing home placement emerges spontaneously as a focus of discussion. A few caregivers reluctantly acknowledged looking forward to placement as a release from excessive burdens of care; still others expressed a wish that their parent would die before or soon after placement so as not to suffer a slow, agonizing death. As might be expected, these reactions are accompanied by intense feelings of guilt.Thinking about the future did not come easily for this group of caregivers. Many were still grappling with the harsh reality that they can't win in the face of this disease. Worry concerning potential genetic transmission to themselves and their children was a major underlying theme for many in our Adult-Child CDR 2 groups.When asked to consider how they might react when their parent dies, most anticipated that they would feel relieved (i.e., that suffering would cease for both themselves and their parent). Yet, they anticipated that this would be replaced by the pain of "feeling like an orphan." Separation from the preceding generation is a fact of life for all of us, yet for dementia caregivers this experience appears especially acute due to the intense care-providing requirements preceding death. Adult-Child (CDR 3, Severe, n = 13). At Stage 3, adult-child caregiver discussions are marked by a very different quality of grief than either of the first two stages. It may be best characterized as a true "grief of the soul." With these individuals, the anger of stage 2 is replaced by a deep sadness for that which can never be again. The predominant theme is the final and absolute loss of the parent as a parent. Unlike earlier stages, where loss is accompanied by frustration and jealousy for others, now it is accompanied by sadness and resignation. One gets the sense that this is not loss in the making, but loss that has been finalized. Associated with this are expressions of helplessness surrounding the fact that there is nothing that anyone can do anymore.Members talk about grief escalating across stages and being at its highest point early in Stage 3. They describe "markers," "defining moments," and "turning points" in their grief (including nursing home placement) as being "additive" in the sense that each experienced loss compounds all previous losses. Yet, while grief escalates linearly into Stage 3, they also speak of a diminution of grief with prolonged time in Stage 3, as if there is eventually an accommodation made to that which cannot be changed.What is noteworthy at this stage is that grief is now associated with lost opportunities and with regrets over not having maximized experiences while the parent was psychosocially "alive." They talk about their appreciation for their parent as coming too late; that they wish they had been more connected, more tolerant, and such, before their parent developed AD; that they had given their parent more attention and credibility; and that they knew then what they know now. The focus is more on these interpersonal regrets than on those intrapersonal burdens that dominated Stage 2.An important distinction made by Adult-Child CDR 3 members is that of intense emotion versus insidious grief. This group appears to have arrived at an acceptance, but only because they have been worn down to this by experiencing continual deterioration. They talk about their relationship with their parent as "the long good-bye." The sharply focused emotions of earlier stages are replaced by more global tiredness, longing, and pining, and a weighty emptiness.Some positive aspects are empathy for their parent and a renewed philosophical perspective on life, relationships, and the caregiving experience. There is much concern expressed for what their parent must be experiencing, especially in those rare moments when the parent is lucid. These periods of lucidity are simultaneously "treasured" and discouraging—the former because they represent human connection, the latter both because they fail over time and because the content is often the parent's wish to die. Some members spoke of being pleased with seeing their parent now releasing previously inhibited behaviors, such as providing hugs, desiring to walk hand in hand, and expressing thanks for little things that are done. While they spoke of the caregiving experience as being difficult, they also said it enhanced their understanding of aging, magnifying the value of human relationships, and contributing to their own self-worth. If there is any silver lining in dementia caregiving for adult-children, this seems to be it. Spouse (CDR 1, Mild, n = 10). Spouse CDR 1 caregivers present a number of striking contrasts with Adult-Child CDR 1 caregivers. First, they are lower in denial and higher in their reality orientation with regard to their own feelings and with regard to what to anticipate over time. Their comments reveal a strong sense of togetherness with their involved spouse ("we're in this together") and a quiet determination to get on with the work of caregiving. Second, they are not as concerned with promoting their spouse's current competencies. Rather than pushing their spouses to accomplish all that their diminishing skills can muster, these caregivers accept present circumstances and adjust their care responses accordingly. They recognize losses of function and may report feeling sad about such changes, but there is not a strong, felt desire to hold onto the past or to provide excuses for what is happening. Third, the focus of loss is less on self and more on the couple-oriented aspects of their experience (e.g., loss of companionship with spouse, loss of shared social activities, cannot go dancing together any longer).Their sense of togetherness is changing (but still present), and this brings a quieter, sadder form of grief than that reported by adult-child caregivers. This acceptance of change may be a function of the spousal role and its location in the life cycle. There is a sense that spouses understand that aging brings decline and death closer and that eventually one has to prepare for self-sufficiency. Preparation for the inevitable differentiates these caregivers from adult-child caregivers. The one exception to this attitude of acceptance is a desire for the spouse with dementia to die first. The thought of leaving that person alone is more than many of these caregivers are willing to accept. There is also a resistance, particularly among the men in these groups, to placing their spouse in a nursing home. At this early stage, this action is viewed as a sign of defeat and one to be avoided at all costs. Spouse (CDR 2, Moderate, n = 10). Unlike the Adult-Child CDR 2 group, whose emotions are dominated by anger, the Spouse CDR 2 group's emotions are dominated by compassion, frustration, and a loving redefinition of the relationship wherein the involved spouse is viewed and cared for as a "beloved child." Caregiving, while burdensome, is provided as an accepted responsibility. Determination to provide the best care possible and not crumble under the burdens of care is as prominent as the underlying emotions. These members contrast their steady, plodding responsibility to their spouse with the heightened emotions they experienced at the time of learning the diagnosis. They describe the latter as a time of greater emotional upheaval. These folks are no longer reeling from that shock. They seem genuinely empathic and understanding, yet intensely saddened by the change in their spouse's life, their own life, and their conjoint life. They no longer look backward, but they also refuse to look forward. Instead, they seem intensely focused on the current tasks of providing the best care possible and maintaining some relationship, albeit a changed one. This unwillingness to be neither retrospective nor prospective appears to have a self-protective quality to it. Focusing exclusively in the present retains their connection with their involved spouse and supports their own sense of integrity, duty, and self-worth. Where there is anger at all, it is directed at the lack of involvement by adult children as collaborative caregivers.The heavy burdens of caregiving in terms of time, demands for focused attention, and energy depletion are addressed, as are losses in the areas of intimacy, companionship, friendship networks, and personal autonomy. They express appreciation for whatever little respite they can gain. The overall impression, however, is that they take on the caregiving role with a remarkable degree of dignity and understanding.For a few Spouse CDR 2 caregivers, nursing home placement has already occurred. These few report intensification of feelings of loss, grief, and guilt, suggesting that the prototypical Spouse CDR 2 caregiver may be experiencing a valley in the grief process sandwiched between peaks at diagnosis and nursing home placement. It is also worth noting that despite their reluctance to project into the future, Spouse CDR 2 caregivers do so when directly asked about anticipatory grief. They convey their belief that most of their grieving has (and is) taken place and that this will reduce their grief in the end. Spouse (CDR 3, Severe, n = 9). What stands out most for spouse caregivers in this advanced stage is a sense of being stuck and unsure how to proceed with life. Although nursing home placement relieved the physical burdens of care, the emotional struggles and sense of responsibility remain and these may be even more prominent now than before. Visits to the nursing home bring comfort at times (e.g., from an "unexpected hug"), but there's a larger sense that the marital relationship (the intimacy, affection, sharing, and mutuality) has ended and a new relationship has taken its place. The togetherness of the past has given way to an uneasy individuality.Living as a single person is a frightening concept. A number of caregivers questioned how it is possible to be an individual when your marriage partner is still living and obligations of care continue. Some expressed significant frustration and anger at being in a "life–death limbo." Guilt and regret surface in response to such reactions.In addition to experiencing the full loss of their marriage, many of these caregivers acknowledge feeling disconnected from both family and friends. The aloneness of this stage appears to magnify such interpersonal loss. Some group members reported working to strengthen and rebuild support networks. For others this is not so easy, particularly when feelings of bitterness get in the way.Unlike our adult-child caregivers at this stage, these spouse caregivers do not seem particularly interested in trying to "figure out" or otherwise find meaning in what has happened. They are simply tired and desirous of relief, but they don't necessarily view spousal death as the ultimate solution to their problems. There is a growing expectation that new manifestations of grief are coming along. How to live as an individual remains an open and confusing question. Qualitative Findings—Anticipatory Grief Narratives for Previously Active Caregivers Members of focus groups whose loved one had since died from AD addressed questions related to their grief experiences during mild, moderate, severe, and postdeath stages. Their retrospective perspectives differ in meaningful ways from the experiences reported by those actively caregiving and so are of questionable value. However, their current perspectives on the effects of anticipatory grieving on postdeath grief are of considerable value and are reported here, in brief. Adult-Child (Deceased, n = 10). Members of Adult-Child D focus groups differed somewhat on the impact of having grieved throughout the dementia process. All reported being "worn down" by the caregiving process ("the funeral that never ends"); all reported an initial sense of relief immediately following their parent's death; and all reported that the caregiving experience enhanced their ability to be compassionate and understanding (i.e., that the impact on character and philosophical outlook first noted in Stage 3 continued). However, there were some differences regarding the longer-term impact of anticipatory grief. For a few, postdeath grief seems to have been eased ("There was relief because she was in peace, but also because the responsibility was over"). However, for most it appears that the initial reduction in postdeath grief was followed by resurgence in grief ("I felt a sense of relief. I cried, because I was feeling so good that she was in peace. A big load was lifted off when she died. When time went on, though, the sadness came in. I have no parents left." Another member: "I didn't think it would be bad when mom died because I grieved while she was alive, but it was." Yet a third example: "I just keep thinking, why did this happen? I am as sad now as when she died"). Spouse (Deceased, n = 13). It appears that, in general, the same is true for Spouse D focus group members. They describe significant and erosive grief during the caregiving process ("I have been grieving losses over the whole period of illness; there was a loss of person before a loss of body"), but they describe a grief that continues ("I have dealt with many losses. It is 3 months after his death and there is a void in my life now"). Obviously, the difficulties for the bereaved spouse are more complex than those for the bereaved child, whose family of choice and whose social contacts are more intact; but for both types of caregivers, it appears that any initial grief reduction is followed by grief intensification (or at least continuation) for some period of time. Discussion The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to look at the grief process for AD caregivers from the combined perspectives of caregiver type and caregiver stage. The value of doing so is supported by the findings that indicate that the grief process is different for adult-child caregivers than for spouse caregivers and that the patterns for each are definable at each stage of dementia progression. This research represents the first phase of a two-phase study. The second phase will test a psychometric instrument designed to assess stage-specific and caregiver-specific grief with the eventual aim of developing appropriate intervention strategies.The conclusions here, derived primarily from focus group discussions, suggest that from the earliest stage of care providing (CDR 1), there are fundamental differences in the grief responses of adult-child and spouse caregivers. Most noteworthy at this early stage is the differential degree of denial invoked. Adult-child caregivers appear to do everything possible to disavow all that is happening. In the language of awareness context theory (Glaser and Strauss 1965   ; Hutchinson, Leger-Krall, and Wilson 1997   ), they and their parent engage in a mutual pretense. These caregivers attribute early dementia to other conditions, such as normal aging or depression; they focus on their parent's capacities rather than on early signs of dementia; they minimize their feelings; and they avoid discussing the future. In contrast, spouse caregivers are more open, accepting, and realistic about their mate's present condition and about impending burdens (including the eventual task of facing nursing home placement). They are clearly sad. They operate more in an open awareness context.In addition to these basic differences, it should also be noted that the two groups at the CDR 1 level differ in the focus of their loss issues. Adult-child caregivers, in keeping with their denial of their parent's dementia, are self-focused. Their loss issues relate to themselves, primarily loss of personal freedom and loss of support by siblings. Spouse caregivers, on the other hand, express loss issues that are largely other-focused (e.g., the beginnings of decline in their partner) and loss issues that are conjoint (e.g., loss of companionship).Differences continue both within and across groups as the involved parent/spouse progresses from mild (CDR 1) to moderate (CDR 2) dementia. Most noteworthy with adult-child caregivers is that they are no longer able to maintain their denial and are now almost crippled with intense raw emotions. While sadness emerges, the predominant emotions tend to be anger, frustration, jealousy of others who are not experiencing AD caregiving, and guilt over newly emerging wishes that the parent would die. Emotions are experienced as erupting, following the previously defended, artificially contained posture witnessed at the CDR 1 stage. When looking at the full progression of grief across the three stages, it appears that grief, as defined by emotional turmoil consequent to loss, is highest for this group at the CDR 2 stage. In contrast, spouse caregivers' emotions increase slowly and linearly from stages CDR 1 to 2. The sadness expressed at the CDR 1 stage continues to mount but is accompanied by an increase in empathy and compassion. Although the difficulties of caregiving are acknowledged, the responsibilities of caregiving are accepted with affection and dignity. There is little of the anger associated with unwanted burden and imposition experienced by the adult-child caregivers. The differences in the responses of each caregiver type are explainable by the nature of the relationship. Children do not anticipate the burdens of caregiving, nor do they accept these as part of life's natural developmental progression. On the other hand, spouses prepare for this all of their married life.The most noteworthy marker of severe (CDR 3) levels of dementia for both groups of caregivers is nursing home placement. For the prototypic adult-child caregiver in this study, there is a sense of emotional relief that comes with nursing home placement. Their burden is lifted, and the intensity of feelings of the previous CDR 2 stage gives way to a mellowing of feelings. The space that was filled with anger, frustration, and jealousy is now filled with reflective and philosophical commentary. Where the previous focus of loss was on the self, the new focus of loss is on the other (e.g., how sad for the parent) and on the conjoint relationship (e.g., regrets over not knowing the parent better). These caregivers feel that the caregiving experience has made them more compassionate individuals. In contrast, spouse caregivers' grief appears now at its highest. For the first time, sadness is accompanied by, or sometimes superceded by, anger and frustration. Nursing home placement brings relief, but it also brings the unwanted realities of self-care and of being uncoupled. The focus of loss shifts from other and conjoint to self.Most interesting in these scenarios are the differences in the quality of emotion experienced by each caregiver type at each stage, the intensity of emotion at each stage, and the differences in the focus of loss at each stage. To summarize, for adult-child caregivers, expressed grief is almost curvalinear; minimal at CDR 1, most intense at CDR 2, and moderated at CDR 3. For spouse caregivers, expressed grief increases linearly from CDRs 1–3. For adult-child caregivers, anger and frustration are predominant when grief is highest (CDR 2) and eventually shifts to sadness (CDR 3). For spouse caregivers, sadness is the predominant emotion during CDR levels 1–2 and shifts in the direction of anger and frustration at CDR 3. For adult-child caregivers, the focus of loss shifts from self at CDR levels 1–2 to other/conjoint at CDR 3. For spouse caregivers, their focus of loss shifts from other/conjoint at CDR 1–2 to self at CDR 3.D groups were incorporated into the design to provide information to two questions. The first question was whether anticipatory grieving has an ameliorating effect on postdeath grief. Looking at the responses of both Adult-Child and Spouse D members, the answer appears to be "yes" initially and "no" in the long run. Members of both groups expressed relief for grief-related emotions immediately following their loved one's death, but also reported high levels of grief over time. The second question is methodological and addresses whether one can rely on the accuracy of retrospective accounts of D participants and not have to collect independent cross-sectional samples of CDR 1, 2, and 3 groups. The answer to this appears to be "no" because a number of incompatibilities are displayed between current and retrospective accounts. For one, both caregiver types at CDR 2 and CDR 3 levels anticipated a permanent benefit from anticipatory grieving; however, as mentioned, D groups show that long-term benefits to early grieving do not accrue. For another, Adult-Child D members minimized experiencing anger in their retrospective accounts, yet adult-child CDR 2 members were enraged. In other words, postdeath idealization did not correspond with the intense anger expressed by adult-child CDR 2 participants. The methodological necessity of obtaining information cross-sectionally at each stage is further supported by inaccurate prospective expectancies. For example, spouse CDR 2 members reported their belief that their grief was the highest it will be in the caregiving experience; but, as it turns out, Spouse CDR 3 participants indicate that theirs is even higher. So, while focus group research in this area is highly time-intensive, it is impossible to cut corners and it appears necessary to assess grief as it unfolds.The conclusions drawn above are primarily derived from a video-based analysis of focus group discussions similar to those delineated by Krueger 1994    and Vaughn, Schumm, and Sinagub 1996    in which raters build narratives based on internally consistent themes. In the present research, multiple independent raters were used to assure consistency of themes across groups. Only those themes that arose repeatedly from independent ratings were considered. The incorporation of quantifiable dimensions (the AGS and the MFG measure) was a secondary consideration. Combining quantitative measures with qualitative procedures produces a "methodological pluralism" which "respects both numbers and narratives and the distinctive forms of understanding that each can promote" (Neimeyer and Hogan 2001   , p. 113). Neimeyer and Hogan go on to say, "… even at this germinal stage in the application of qualitative paradigms to the study of loss, it is clear that they begin to paint a picture of bereavement that is far more complex and less tidy than that suggested by the artificially simplified and controlled canvasses of quantitative questionnaires" (p. 113). In the current research, this was true. While the quantitative and qualitative findings were often compatible and mutually supportive, at other times they added complexity that required interpretive creativity. For example, correlational data indicated that the overall grief levels of adult-child and spouse caregivers are roughly equivalent, yet the qualitative analyses showed differences in the construction of grief processes across caregiver type and caregiver stages. Also, for example, while the correlational findings suggest that grief decreases as dementia progresses, thereby supporting the anticipatory grief hypothesis, the qualitative findings suggest more complex patterns across time and, in fact, support the anticipatory grief hypothesis in the short run only.Some of the incompatibility between the quantitative and qualitative findings may have resulted from the poor response to the quantitative measures. First, and most important, not all participants filled out these measures. Some did not fill out the AGS and some left large portions of the MFG blank. Both the AGS and the MFG came at the end of a lengthy booklet, and some participants expressed fatigue. Furthermore, a number of participants who did complete these measures stated that they did so a month or more prior to their focus group participation and that they would now respond differently. This was especially true for the MFG scale.One thing that is interesting is that while the MFG scale was newly devised and could only claim face validity, it correlated highly with the AGS, which is more established and which claims to be the only grief scale specifically developed for dementia caregivers. Therefore, the MFG, which demonstrated decent internal consistency (alpha = 0.93), can now also claim some concurrent validity. Furthermore, the MFG scale showed the capacity to differentiate caregiver types on dimensions that are corroborated by the qualitative findings (e.g., adult-children scoring higher on jealousy for others, negativity, and questioning the meaning of life; and spouses scoring higher on loneliness and loss of sexual interest). Additional reliability and validity studies of the MFG scale may establish its utility for future research.The present study supports the benefits of studying caregiver grief in a stage sensitive, caregiver-specific model. The divergent grief trajectories across stages for adult-child and spouse caregivers suggest that clinical interventions can be tailored with these dimensions in mind. For example, educative techniques designed to gently confront caregivers with accurate information may be most helpful for adult-child caregivers in the early stages, when they are in their greatest denial. Spouse caregivers at this same stage appear more realistic and knowledgeable about their situations and may benefit most from support groups. Likewise, these data suggest that anger management techniques might be uniquely appropriate for adult-child caregivers in the moderate stages, when their anger appears at its highest, but less appropriate for spouse caregivers, who appear to more typically experience extreme sadness rather than extreme anger at this same stage. Interventions at the severe stage should emphasize a shift to individuality concerns for spouse caregivers (e.g., how to live alone), whereas the emphasis for child caregivers becomes one of philosophical integration.Although there are limitations to using a focus group format for collecting behavioral data (e.g., abdicating methodological precision and control, less quantification of variables), there are recognizable advantages, such as obtaining a richness of information that can only be derived from real life narratives. Recent reviews have acknowledged these advantages for grief-related research (e.g., Neimeyer and Hogan 2001   ) and have discussed ways to maximize precision (e.g., using semistructured to structured interviewing formats; prompting all participants to report their full range of experiences; recording only themes that appear consistently across raters). These criteria were followed in the present research. Another advantage of this qualitatively based design for the present investigations is that all prominent quotes derived from the focus group discussions of Phase I are available as items for the Phase II questionnaire. Approximately 190 of these quotes, or paraphrased versions, are currently being administered to a sample of 200 active caregivers. Their responses will be factor analyzed to develop a stage-sensitive, caregiver-specific instrument for use in various supportive settings (e.g., Alzheimer's Association support groups). The resulting grief inventory will also be compared to participants' responses to other instruments in the Phase II questionnaire; namely, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Geriatric Depression Scale–Short Form, the Assumptive World Scale, Caregiver Strain Index, and the Well-Being Scale. We anticipate that our investigations will characterize caregiver grief as a distinct form of distress in the larger depression–burden–stress constellation and will form the foundation for grief-specific interventions. Instructions for Videotape Raters (abbreviated version) Watching the Videotape With Grief Researcher's Eye and EarWhat does this mean? Basically, you need to focus on the reported or manifest reactions of the caregivers as they discuss the losses that they've experienced. Many of our caregivers spoke in some depth about changes in their loved one's functioning as if they were attending a regular caregiver support group. Each person had to tell his or her Alzheimer's story before being able to discuss personal grief reactions. Your challenge is to filter out the stories and get to the heart of each person's felt grief reactions.What is grief in this context? We used a definition from Dr. Therese Rando as a guide:"a phenomenon encompassing the processes of mourning, coping, interaction, planning, and psychosocial reorganization that are stimulated and begun … in response to the awareness of … impending loss" (Rando 1986   , p 24).Grief reactions occur when personally meaningful losses are recognized as having occurred or as impending. Recognition of loss initiates the grief process. Caregivers experience numerous "mini-deaths" over the typical 10-year course of Alzheimer's disease, yet many of these losses probably go unrecognized. These may include loss of companionship, shared goals, mutual support, longstanding roles, etc. Some of our caregivers appeared to recognize specific losses for the first time in response to our questioning. Sadness probably stands out as a core grief reaction for most people. Many other reactions are possible as evidenced by the list in The Many Faces of Grief questionnaire. Your job is to listen for these various grief reactions and make some judgments about what's important or meaningful for the people in the group and the stage of caregiving they represent (early, moderate, severe, postdeath).Recording Important Impressions and QuotationsThis part of the rating process involves more of your personal perceptions and experience. The enclosed Narrative Rating Form (which is also on the computer disk) lists each of the main questions for the study with space for you to record pertinent information. Your role here is to listen for key quotations, responses and concepts, and then record these as they apply to each question. Use bullet points to help separate your comments.Please associate quotations to specific participants by assigning each person with a number and putting it in parentheses after the quote. Count off from left to right, such that the person immediately to Dr. Marwit's left is #1 and so on. Finish each section with a few summary comments. The form has just one page per question—feel free to add extra pages if needed. For example:"I had no idea what I was dealing with at the time … just that something was wrong … I was devastated when we finally learned Mary had dementia …" (2)3 of the 5 group members report feeling overwhelmed by the news. Each learned at the point of diagnosis in the doctor's office. The other two had strong hunches of a problem and reported feeling somewhat relieved.Although we attempted to follow a certain order in our questioning, you'll find that some participants provide answers to more than one question at the same time. As best you can, try to record your thoughts in the space for the appropriate question. You do not have to get everything written down, just key points as they relate to grief. We're not interested in stories about how particular patient's decline or past life stories. The only exception to this is where a story captures something important about the grief process for the caregiver. For example:Bill (#2) reported having golfed with his Dad every week for most of his adult life. Now that his Dad has dementia and is in a nursing home, this shared activity is lost. "My Dad and I never really talked. We felt close to each other in our shared physical activities … I'm so distant from him now … I feel this deep sadness come over me every Saturday morning when we would have gone golfing … I miss sharing my thoughts with him."In addition to recording responses and thoughts related to each question, keep an ear open for the focus of loss in the group. Are members discussing what they have lost personally (e.g., "I don't have any time for my kids. Caring for Dad is all-consuming and I so need a break") or are they more focused on what their loved one with dementia has lost (e.g., "I feel so sad that my husband can't garden anymore. He loved his garden so much and now he just seems like a shell of his former self. Every day I wish he could feel more like he used to"). Rate this focus for the group on the 1–7 scale listed on the form: 1 = complete focus on personal losses; 7 = complete focus on loved one's losses. Include explanatory comments for your rating as needed. The focus of loss rating is on the fifth page of the Narrative Rating Form.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study was undertaken to develop a performance-based instrument to measure a range of function present among nursing home (NH) residents and to establish the reliability and validity of the measures. Design and Methods: Fourteen items integral to daily life in a NH setting were administered to 95 NH residents with sufficient cognitive ability to follow a one-step command at baseline, 1 week later, and 6 months later. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Cronbach's coefficient alpha were calculated for reliability estimates. The Minimum Data Set (MDS), Katz, and Multidimensional Observational Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) were used to establish concurrent validity. Factor analysis, correlation matrices, and other objective criteria were used for item reduction. Results: Test–retest reliability for items ranged between .73 and .93. Factor analysis and correlations between Nursing Home Physical Performance Test (NHPPT) items and scales with measures of activities of daily living (ADL) suggest that the NHPPT taps aspects of gross motor function (Factor 1) and fine motor coordination and task sequencing (Factor 2) required for ADL function and mobility. The NHPPT may also tap aspects of ADL function and mobility not measured by the MDS (r = –.72–.75), MOSES (r = –.82–.84), or Katz (r = –.75–.77) scales. Effect sizes based on mean change scores were larger for the NHPPT scales (.38–.53) than for the other functional scales (.27–.33). Implications: The NHPPT is a reliable performance-based instrument that discriminates among frail NH residents. Further studies are necessary to assess the value of this instrument for prediction and monitoring of functional status in the NH.   Aging ,  Physical performance ,  Activities of daily living Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDPerformance-based measures are well recognized as a tool for identifying community-dwelling older adults at risk for functional decline and death (Guralnik, Ferrucci, Simonsick, Salive, and Wallace 1995   ; Guralnik, Simonsick, and Ferrucci 1996   ; Reuben, Rubenstein, Hirsch, and Hays 1992   ; Reuben, Siu, and Kimpau 1992   ; Seeman et al. 1994   ) and have become an important component of geriatric assessment (Applegate, Blass, and Williams 1990   ; Branch and Meyers 1987   ). Brief physical performance measures can aid in the detection and delineation of physical limitations by providing a standardized measure of a particular physiologic domain. For example, timed chair rise has been used to assess skeletal muscle strength (Csuka and McCarty 1985   ), and the 6-min walk test has been used as a measure of endurance and cardiovascular fitness (Peeters and Mets 1996   ). For purposes of functional assessment, performance-based measures provide standardized observation of tasks that can serve as proxy measures for activities of daily living (ADL) tasks that require more time to complete, and therefore to observe. Physical performance measures offer other advantages over self-report and observer-rated measures of function with regards to validity, reproducibility, and sensitivity to change, and they may be less influenced by education, language, and caregiver expectation. They also allow for distinctions between an individual's usual function and the maximum level of function possible for a particular task (Guralnik, Branch, Cummings, and Curb 1989   ).To date, the application of performance-based functional assessment to individuals with low levels of ADL function has been very limited. Patients with severe levels of disability, such as those in nursing homes (NH), are frequently unable to perform many available validated performance tests without assistance and therefore score at the "floor" (minimum score) for a number of items (Reuben and Siu 1990   ; Tinetti 1986   ). This makes it difficult to detect change in performance over time. The Physical Performance and Mobility Exam, which was developed with a sample of frail hospitalized patients, contains only mobility-related items (Winograd et al. 1994   ), and therefore does not provide more comprehensive functional assessment. Some more comprehensive performance-based instruments have been developed for NH residents with mild dementia and for community-dwelling individuals with dementia. The 54-item Physical Disability Index (PDI; Gerety et al. 1993   ) was developed with NH residents who had mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Although the PDI captures a wide range in performance ability, its application to research and clinical settings has been limited by the training and time required for test administration. Instruments that have been developed with community-dwelling older adults with dementia (Loewenstein et al. 1989   ; Mahurin, DeBettignies, and Pirozzolo 1991   ; Skurla and Sunderland 1988   ) include test items that rely primarily on cognitive abilities, are more relevant to tasks necessary for independent function in the community, and do not measure mobility function.A brief performance-based instrument could be useful in the NH setting for interdisciplinary team assessment and care planning and baseline and outcome assessment for a variety of interventions aimed at improving physical functioning, including rehabilitation programs and clinical drug trials. Since 1991, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) instrument (Morris, Nonemaker, and Murphy 1995   ) has been mandated for use in federally certified NHs as a standard-ized functional assessment instrument. Although the MDS is a valid and reliable instrument when administered according to protocol (Hawes et al. 1995   ), mobility and ADL function are measured in relation to how the NH resident has performed the activity over the previous 7 days. Factors such as NH staffing limitations can make it difficult for NH residents to perform at or near maximal capacity, so that the MDS may reflect not what individuals are actually able to do, but rather what they are allowed to do by NH staff. The MDS does not include timed performance measures, which may be more sensitive to a change in a resident's condition. For example, information about speed of performance is not included in the MDS even though there is evidence that speed measures are highly predictive of health status (Gill, Williams, and Tinetti 1995   ). In addition, MDS measures may not detect subtle changes in performance that reflect new or worsened ADL disability (Snowden et al. 1999   ) that may also be amenable to interventions.The primary aim of this study was to develop and validate a multidimensional physical performance instrument for assessment of ADL and mobility function in the NH setting. Our intent was to develop an instrument that would allow for greater discrimination among individuals whose physical function is at the lower end of the spectrum. Another hypothesis was that an instrument that includes measures of speed and endurance would allow greater sensitivity to change than existing measures of functional ability. Methods Instrument Development The design of the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test (NHPPT; see Appendix) followed established procedures for instrument development (Kirshner and Guyatt 1985   ). Tasks integral to everyday life in the NH setting were selected by an expert panel using a nominal group process that focused on integrated tasks such as transfer, ambulation, hygiene, dressing, eating, and telephone use. Candidate test items were selected from existing performance-based measures when possible (Jebsen, Taylor, Trieschmann, Trotter, and Howard 1969   ; Peeters and Mets 1996   ; Podsiadlo and Richardson 1991   ; Reuben and Siu 1990   ; Tinetti 1986   ), using the following criteria: (a) face validity for ADL tasks appropriate to the NH setting, (b) simplicity and ease of administration, (c) safety in the NH setting, (d) ease of quantification, and (e) low participant burden. Existing test items were modified to accommodate the range of physical and cognitive impairments common among NH residents with the aim of reducing floor and ceiling effects. The initial test battery included 14 items ( Table 1  ).Standardized procedures were developed a priori for administering and scoring each test item and for prompting and/or assisting research participants when necessary. To maximize safe testing and minimize participant burden, tasks were ordered to avoid repeated performance of maneuvers such as transfers and ambulation. The test battery was pilot tested with 8 participants to refine administration procedures before it was administered to a larger sample of NH residents. Participants and Sites Participants were recruited from two not-for-profit urban community NHs. Eligibility criteria included the following: 65 years of age or older, ability to follow a one-step command, and absence of acute illness or unstable medical condition. Participants were excluded for the following criteria: enrollment in a hospice program or anticipated survival of less than 6 months, enrollment in a subacute care program, inability to follow directions due to sensory impairments, or chronically bed-bound or requiring Hoyer lift for transfers. Participants or a proxy provided informed consent for study participation as approved by the Washington University Human Subjects Committee. Performance Testing Protocol The NHPPT was administered twice 48 hr apart at baseline, 1 week later, and 6 months later. Two trials were performed for all test items except standing balance, sit-to-stands, chair transfer, and 6-m and 6-min walk/wheel, for which only one trial was performed. (The first 6 m of the 6-min walk were timed using the same preferred mode of mobility for both, e.g., walking or wheeling.) Testing was conducted in the resident's room except for the walking/wheeling procedure, which was performed in a predesignated low-traffic hallway. Two research staff members administered the performance test battery: one instructing, prompting, or assisting the participant, the other scoring and timing the items. The staff alternated these responsibilities across days of testing for each resident. Scoring Procedures. To create an instrument with discriminative power and sensitivity to change over time, task performance was measured in two ways. A score was assigned to describe the amount of assistance and/or prompting required to complete each task, ranging from no assistance and no verbal prompting (score = 4), to verbal prompting without any physical assistance (score = 3), minimal physical assistance (score = 2), maximal physical assistance (score = 1), or unable (score = 0). Assistive devices were allowed but not included in the assistance level scoring. Procedures for prompting, assistance, and scoring were defined a priori for each item and are described in the procedure manual (available from corresponding author on request).Task performance was also measured in relation to the time required to complete the task or, in the case of sit-to-stands, the number completed or, for the 6-min walk/wheel, the distance traveled. These measures were not recorded for participants who were unable to perform the test item (assistance score = 0) or for participants who required maximal physical assistance (assistance score = 1). Concurrent Measures Because there is no "gold standard" to measure functional status and mobility in NH residents, we used construct and concurrent validation procedures. Three validated instruments of functional status were administered: the MDS Version 2.0 (Morris et al. 1995   ) ADL Long Form (or MDS–ADL; range 0– 28; Morris, Fries, and Morris 1999   ), the Multidimensional Observational Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES; self-care subscale, range 0–36; Helmes, Caapo, and Short 1987   ), and the Katz instrument (range 6–18; Katz, Ford, and Moskowitz 1963   ). For all three instruments, a higher score is indicative of poorer functional status. Research staff followed standardized procedures for administration of these instruments.The Short Blessed Test of Orientation, Concentration, and Memory (SBT) (Blessed, Tomlinson, and Roth 1968   ; Katzman et al. 1983   ) was administered to assess participants' cognitive function.The MDS, MOSES, Katz, and SBT were administered at baseline and at 6 months. NH records were used to collect information about demographics, medical history, and medication use. Statistical Analyses We analyzed the data using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute 1994   ). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to examine interrater and test-retest reliability for each item. To evaluate concurrent validity, Spearman rho correlation coefficients were calculated between the NHPPT items and the MDS–ADL, Katz, and MOSES items. The internal consistency of hierarchical scales was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's coefficient alpha. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ .05. Scale Development Because the distributions of most of the measures of time, distance, or number (hereinafter referred to as "quantitative") were skewed, statistical outliers were identified using a box plot and eliminated. A maximum value was assigned for each item on the basis of the distribution of values for that item. The maximum value was substituted when an individual's performance was greater than the maximum value (including individuals with outlying values) or when the individual had an assistance score of 0 or 1. Quartile ranges were calculated for each item (except standing balance), and a categorical score was assigned for each quartile ranging from 0 (unable, or measured performance greater than maximum value) to 4 (best performance). Item Reduction A factor analysis was performed using principal-components analysis with varimax rotation to determine which items to retain in the final instrument. The results of the factor analysis were interpreted using both the Kaiser-Guttman rule and examination of the scree plots of eigenvalues. Factor scores were constructed by summing the respective scores for items with a factor loading greater than 0.50. Additional criteria used for item reduction included internal consistency of items within the factor structure and redundancy. Redundancy was defined as pairs of items with a bivariate correlation coefficient greater than .80. A total NHPPT score was constructed by summing the factor scores. Assessment of Stability/Responsiveness to Change To examine the stability of the NHPPT scale relative to other functional scales, paired t tests were performed for each scale (6 month value vs baseline value). Effect sizes were calculated for each scale (mean change divided by the standard deviation of the change; Cohen 1988   ), as well as the estimated sample size needed to detect the observed mean changes if one were testing the efficacy of an intervention in a controlled clinical trial (Hulley and Cummings 1988   ), using a two-tailed alpha of .05 and a power of .80.The analyses regarding validity, item reduction, and stability were performed using both the quantitative scores and the assistance level scores, separately and as combined (summed) factor and total NHPPT scores. Results Of the 308 available NH residents, 78 residents (25%) did not meet eligibility criteria for the following indications: unable to follow a one-step command (n = 56), bedbound (n = 10), not English speaking (n = 6), terminal illness (n = 2), sensory impairment (n = 2), and/or age less than 65 years (n = 2). Informed consent was obtained from 131 residents or their proxies. Thirty-six of the individuals who provided consent either withdrew consent (n = 7) or had severe dementia (n = 22) and/or sensory impairments (n = 7) that prohibited participation. The final sample consisted of 95 residents. Baseline characteristics of the sample are presented in  Table 2  . Participants with severe cognitive impairment (SBT score ≥18) comprised 37% of the sample.The distributions of assistance scores are presented in  Table 3  . Individuals with assistance scores of 1 or 2 were combined, due to the low frequency of occurrence. The distribution of scores for mobility-related items (sit-to-stand, chair transfer, walking/wheeling items) was generally bimodal, with the majority of residents scoring at the highest or lowest levels. This was in part due to the sequence of NHPPT items; individuals unable or requiring maximal assistance for the sit-to-stand items also received an assistance score of 0 (unable) for the standing balance and chair transfer items because standing was a requisite component task for those items. None of the participants had an assistance score of 0 for all items.Baseline results for NHPPT quantitative measures are presented in  Table 4  . The data presented in  Table 4  and all other analyses were calculated using maximum values. Reliability ICCs between measurements taken by two different raters ranged from 0.82 to 1.0 for the quantitative measures and from 0.86 to 1.0 for assistance level scores. Test–retest reliability (ICCs between measures at baseline and 1 week) was 0.83 or greater for all items with the exception of turning cards, which had an ICC of 0.73.The analyses described next were performed using the quantitative raw measurements and scores, the assistance level scores, and a summed score in which the two scores were added together. We found that the assistance level scores did not add significantly to the validity and internal consistency of the NHPPT and did less well in relation to stability and sensitivity to change. For this reason we elected to use only the quantitative measures for the NHPPT instrument; data related to assistance level scores are not presented. Construct and Concurrent Validity As expected, Spearman rho correlations between NHPPT items and MDS–ADL, MOSES, and Katz items were stronger for items that had face validity for similar ADL domains and ranged from .40 and .77. For example, the correlations between scooping applesauce and the MOSES and MDS–ADL eating items and Katz feeding were −.63, −.40, and −.59, respectively. The correlations between chair transfer and MDS–ADL and MOSES toileting items were −.56 and −.57, respectively. The correlation between put on and take off sweater and MDS–ADL and MOSES dressing were −.56 and −.58, respectively. All coefficients were significantly greater than zero (p < .001). Item Reduction Results from the factor analysis of the total 13-item NHPPT score are presented in  Table 5  . The 10-s standing balance task was excluded from this analysis because of redundancy with 60-s balance scores. Two factors had eigenvalues above 1.0. Transfer, mobility, and dressing items loaded on Factor 1, whereas the other items loaded on Factor 2. Validation of the two-factor structure was conducted by summing NHPPT item scores that had factor loadings greater than 0.5 (Factor 1 score and Factor 2 score) and then correlating the factor scores with item scores on the MDS–ADL, MOSES, and Katz scales (e.g., eating, grooming, transfer, etc.). As expected, correlations were higher between the Factor 1 score and transfer, mobility, and dressing item scores on the other scales and between Factor 2 score and eating and grooming item scores.Cronbach's coefficient alphas for the factor scores and the NHPPT 13-item score were .92 (Factor 1, 7 items), .93 (Factor 2, 6 items), and .92 (total NHPPT score), indicating high internal consistency among the items.Using objective criteria, we eliminated NHPPT items from each of the factors, with the aim of making the instrument as brief as possible without significantly reducing construct validity or internal consistency. Correlations between the timed sit-to-stand item and the number of sit-to-stands, standing balance, and chair transfer items were greater than .80. Due to the hierarchical testing protocol, participants who were unable to stand or required maximal assistance did not complete the number of sit-to-stands, standing balance, and chair transfer items. For these reasons, those three items were eliminated from the Factor 1 score. The eat applesauce item was eliminated because (a) it was highly correlated with the scoop applesauce item (r = .74), (b) a number of individuals either could not (n = 2) or refused (n = 25) to perform the item, and (c) it had slightly lower correlations than the scooping item with the MDS–ADL, MOSES, and Katz eating items. Other items were retained in the factor structure on the basis of the combination of items that produced the highest Cronbach's coefficient alpha. This resulted in a 6-item battery that included the following measures: Factor 1(three items): sit-to-stand (timed), put on/take off sweater, and 6-m walk/wheel; and Factor 2(three items): scooping applesauce, face washing, and telephone use. Cronbach's coefficient alpha of the factor scores and the six-item NHPPT battery were as follows: .83 for the Factor 1 score, .88 for the Factor 2 score, and .92 for the six-item NHPPT total score. Validity of Summary Scales Construct validity for the factor scores and NHPPT total score were evaluated by calculating Spearman rho correlations with the total scores for the SBT, MDS–ADL, MOSES, and Katz scales ( Table 6  ). The NHPPT total scores were moderately correlated with the SBT (range: rs = −.33 to −.42, p < .001) and were highly correlated with the functional scales (range: rs = −.72 to −.84, p < .001). The Factor 1 scores were poorly correlated with the SBT (range: rs = −.11 to −.13, ps = .25 to −.35), whereas the Factor 2 scores were moderately correlated with the SBT (range: rs = −.42 to −.58, p = .0001), suggesting that Factor 2 tasks were more related to cognitive function. Stability, Effect Size, and Sample Size Estimates The stability of the NHPPT over time was evaluated through comparisons of data for 79 residents collected at baseline and 6 months (at 6 months, 13 residents were deceased, 1 refused, and 1 was untestable due to dementia). Mean changes in NHPPT, SBT, MDS–ADL, MOSES, and Katz scores are shown in  Table 7  . A significant decrease was observed for all the scales except the SBT. The NHPPT had a larger effect size than the other functional scales and consequently smaller estimated sample size requirements for a potential between-group design. Discussion The NHPPT was designed to measure physical function in very frail older adults in the presence or absence of cognitive impairment. To our knowledge, this is the first brief performance-based instrument designed to measure a number of functional tasks and accommodate a range of cognitive and physical impairments observed in the NH setting. NHPPT items had good interrater and test–retest reliability in this population. ICCs for the mobility measures were similar to analogous measures reported previously by Tappen and colleagues (Tappen, Roach, Buchner, Barry, and Edelstein 1997   ) for a sample of NH residents with dementia, although we had higher ICCs for the sit-to-stand measure and the short distance (6-m) walk. Our superior reliability may have been due to our use of standardized procedures for cueing and assistance.We were able to demonstrate concurrent and construct validity of NHPPT items and summary scores through comparisons with other measures of functional status appropriate for an NH population. The magnitude of the correlations between the NHPPT and ADL scales suggests that the NHPPT may offer information related to function that is not captured by the other ADL scales. Our factor analysis suggests that the NHPPT captures constructs related to gross motor function, balance, flexibility, fine motor coordination, and task sequencing that are required for mobility and ADL activities. As might be expected, the Factor 2 score, which included tasks requiring fine motor coordination and task sequencing, was more highly correlated with the SBT score. Similarly, the Factor 1 score, with tasks requiring gross motor function, flexibility, and balance, was poorly correlated with the SBT. The separate factor scores may enable clinicians to better distinguish between declines in these two domains.Although the NHPPT captured a greater range in function than previous performance-based instruments, at least one third of the residents at our study sites did not meet our eligibility criteria. Most of these individuals had end-stage dementia such that they were not testable (e.g., they could not follow a one-step command) and required complete assistance in ADLs. Thus, although our instrument is not applicable to all NH residents, most of those who are unable to complete NHPPT items may not be testable using currently available performance-based methods. Further study is needed to identify whether other testing strategies such as environmental cueing might capture some of the population that was not testable in this study.We measured performance in two ways (assistance level and quantitative measures) with the idea that the information from each type of measurement might better discriminate between individuals and provide greater sensitivity to change. We found, however, that the assistance level scoring did not improve the reliability, validity, or discrimination of the instrument. This may have been because the majority of individuals were either independent or completely dependent for task completion, particularly for the mobility items.The effect sizes and sample estimates for the NHPPT scales were better than those for the other functional scales, suggesting that the NHPPT may have greater sensitivity to change. Our ability to draw inferences is limited, however, because we did not have a gold standard to evaluate the clinical significance of the score changes observed. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the NHPPT's utility in documenting early changes in clinical status, the effects of interventions, and the ability of the NHPPT to predict functional decline in the NH setting.The six-item NHPPT battery has construct validity that is nearly equivalent to the longer test battery, with a similar calculated effect size and a minimal decline in internal consistency. This version of the test takes approximately 15 min to complete and therefore has potential applicability to both clinical and research settings.In summary, our work demonstrates the reliability and validity of the NHPPT as an objective measure of physical function among NH residents who do not have end-stage dementia. The NHPPT may prove useful as a tool for predicting subsequent functional decline and monitoring the effects of interventions in the NH setting. For example, because the NHPPT includes measures of speed, NH personnel may be able to detect improvements in function more readily than more difficult and slow changes in assistance levels. Likewise, a lack of improvement over short periods of time or an abrupt decline in performance may alert staff that intervention strategies need to be instituted or modified. Future research and clinical applications will be necessary to clarify the utility of the NHPPT.  None  Table a. Nursing Home Physical Performance Test  View Large Table a.

     Abstract This article presents a brief screening tool to help case managers identify clients in a home- and community-based services (HCBS) program who need more intensive social work case management (CM). Using existing data from a case management time study (N = 242) and a content analysis of 70 cases in a Medicaid waiver–funded HCBS program, this study highlights a number of issues, such as dementia-related behavior problems, noncompliance with treatment, poor informal caregiver health and mental health, and a conflicted or problematic relationship between client and caregiver, which are useful in predicting need for intensive case management. Kappas for interrater reliability and t tests for discriminant validity show these items to be reliable and valid. This tool will allow for better allocation of CM resources in terms of case manager time and type of expertise needed to address these issues.   Risk identification ,  Older adults ,  Intensive case management ,  Social work practice Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDLong-term care case management is generally viewed as an undifferentiated, administrative activity in most home- and community-based services (HCBS) programs (Newcomer, Arnsberger, and Zhang 1997   ). Case management activity typically consists of an assessment of individual needs, the brokering of in-home services, and ongoing monitoring of the care plan. The implicit assumption is that a long-term care client can be maintained in the community simply by providing the typical range of supportive services such as homemaker, home health aide, nursing care, meals, and respite care. A large proportion of individuals in HCBS programs are cared for by family members and need only minimal to moderate levels of case manager oversight to arrange for and monitor supportive services. However, a significant number of people in these programs have individual or family problems that require a greater level of case management in terms of monitoring as well as intervention skill to maintain these clients safely in the community. Behaviors such as noncompliance with treatment, personality issues (e.g., being overly demanding of service providers), and conflicts between the client and caregiver can interfere with the maintenance of a successful care plan. In such instances, case managers report needing extra time and skills to deal with these problems effectively. The presence of "clinical" issues in case management practice have been noted by others such as Burack-Weiss 1988    and Morrow-Howell 1992   , but as Austin 1996    observes, the theoretical and practice literature on long-term care case management devotes little attention to issues related to mental health counseling and psychosocial issues. Furthermore, the tendency of policy makers to view case management as an administrative activity with little intrinsic value added to the long-term care system has resulted in a trend toward larger caseload sizes and case management programs that are able to offer little more than service brokerage functions.What are the consequences of unmet needs for appropriate case management? If a client's situation calls for a level of case management that a program is unable to provide, it is likely that this mismatch will defeat the goals of the HCBS program, which is to keep the client in the community and avoid or delay institutionalization. Not addressing these problems adequately may result in a shorter community stay for the client especially if the client's safety is at issue. Quality of care in the community setting is also compromised if case management services are not matched to client needs.With the expansion of Medicaid-funded HCBS programs, all of which offer case management as a core service, it is becoming necessary to develop a better understanding of who needs how much and what type of case management. In an effort to address this issue, the case management program discussed in this article has begun to examine and categorize the type of client situations that call for more intensive case management to effectively maintain clients in the community. Based on a review of client charts, a brief screening tool was developed that has been used by case managers to determine which of their clients were likely to need intensive case management services. The purpose of the tool was to provide case managers with an empirically based mechanism that would identify clients with greater needs and allow a justification of differential allocation of case management resources in the program. Identifying Need for Intensive Case Management Practitioners and researchers have been grappling with the problem of how to identify those who may benefit from more intensive case management. The primary belief underlying this issue is that people have different needs and problems, and that the level of case management ought to correspond better with the varied levels of client needs. Level or intensity of case management refers to both the amount of time spent on a case as well as the focus of the case management activity, which can include brokering for services, problem solving, counseling the client and the family, advocacy, and resource development.The ecological approach to understanding human behavior provides the basis for identification and classification of clients with differing needs for case management services. This approach examines the degree of fit between person and environment and directs practitioners to develop interventions that affect the transactions between the person and environment (Lewis and Greene 1994   ). Applied to case management practice, this approach would encourage interventions that meet specific individual needs rather than using a cookie-cutter approach (see Kane 1995   ) to case management. By addressing the unique needs of individual clients, case managers are able to meet client needs more effectively while maintaining the client's autonomy, self-determination, and dignity.Several different approaches have been used to determine allocation of case management resources. One approach has been to allocate case management to clients based upon preselected criteria that are used to determine who will get what level of case management (Applebaum and Mayberry 1996   ). Other studies in the literature have targeted specific subgroups of clients (e.g., people with dementia) for intensive case management (Newcomer et al. 1997   ; Challis, von Abendorff, Brown, and Chesterman 1997   ). Another approach has been to empirically examine the characteristics of clients and caregivers to determine aspects of their situations that lead to increased use of case management resources (Diwan 1999   ).One study found dementia-related behavior problems to be predictive of greater use of case manager time (Diwan and Phillips 2001   ). Other problematic client and caregiver characteristics, however, have not been examined separately to assess their individual impact on case management time. The efficacy of intensive case management with clients with dementia has already been demonstrated in earlier studies (see Challis et al. 1997   ; Eggert, Friedman, and Zimmer 1990   ; Newcomer et al. 1997   ). Yet, although persons with Alzheimer's or other dementias constitute a significant portion of the participants in HCBS programs, there are many other clients who need more intensive case management but who have not been targeted to receive such services in most HCBS programs.Time studies of case management activity (Diwan 1999   ; Kemper 1990   ) have shown that most clients need a larger amount of case management activity at the time of assessment or reassessment, but this activity gradually decreases over time as the care plan is implemented and the client's needs have been addressed. However, case managers report the existence of a group of clients who repeatedly go through cycles of high case management activity. The problems encountered in these cases tend to disrupt the care plans that are developed for the clients and necessitate intensive case management. The focus of case management in such cases is either to stabilize the situation or to discharge the client from the program as the client can no longer be maintained in the community. Developing a better profile of these types of client situations will assist in developing more appropriate strategies to manage these cases more effectively. This study extends earlier work on the allocation of case management resources through a qualitative analysis of data that provides case managers with a brief assessment tool that includes descriptive as well as empirical information on the various client and caregiver characteristics that call for a more intensive model of case management. Methods The case management program used for this study is funded through a Medicaid Waiver for home- and community-based services. Clients are assigned to a case manager by service area rather than on the basis of any particular client or case manager characteristic. The professional training of case managers is varied and includes social work, psychology/counseling, sociology, gerontology, and public services. This case management agency not only emphasizes higher education and relevant experience among its case managers, it also has a strong quality assurance program that includes individual and group supervision, clinical supervision, and ongoing staff development workshops. All these activities help ensure that clients receive a fairly uniform and high level of case management service.Both qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis were used to develop the brief tool to identify clients needing more intensive case management. Each of these methods is described below. Seventy cases that had been identified by 11 case managers as needing intensive case management were first analyzed for content. The case managers were asked to select cases based on any of the following criteria: (a) they perceived the case to require a great deal of their attention and time; (b) they experienced more than average difficulty in successfully implementing a care plan; or (c) the cases experienced repeated "crisis" episodes that needed intensive intervention. Although the criteria for selecting cases to be included in the study were subjective, the cases selected by the 11 case managers were remarkably similar in the overall nature of the issues confronting the case manager.Cross-case analysis was the method used to identify distinct clusters or families of cases. The common strategy for data analysis using this method is to find themes that cut across cases (see Huberman and Miles 1994   ). Based on an initial review of the cases, common themes were extracted and developed into several broad categories or predictor variables. The data were reexamined to understand the particular configurations within each case, that is, the issues or problems that appeared to accompany the particular predictor variables. For approximately half of the sample cases (n = 33), two raters were asked to read each case and note the presence or absence of the predictor variables. This step was necessary to ensure reliability or consistency in coding the variables using the information in the charts. The Kappa statistic was used to assess the interrater reliability for coding the predictor variables.Using an existing data set on the use of case management time in this HCBS program, the discriminant validity of these predictor variables was assessed through the use of t tests to determine whether these variables could differentiate between high and low users of case management time. The sample in this data set consisted of 242 randomly selected clients in the same HCBS program who were tracked over a 4-month period for the amount of case management time spent. This data set also contained information on demographic characteristics, health and functional status, and other problems/issues related to clients, informal caregivers, and formal service providers. This sample and the setting have been described in detail elsewhere (Diwan 1999   ).To extract themes from qualitative data, Dey 1993    notes that some categories can be developed a priori guided by theory or previous research and experience. Other categories are developed, or differentiation within categories occurs, through closer inspection of the data. Based on previous work on predictors of intensive case management and additional insight obtained through conversations with case management staff, we created an initial matrix that contained three broad categories: client behavior and personality characteristics; informal caregiver behavior and personality characteristics; and client's medical condition or frailty. On this matrix each case also had a comment section for brief descriptions of issues pertaining to each category. A review of these comments after the initial coding enabled us to further refine the client and caregiver characteristics, leading to the development of additional subcategories. Thus, within client characteristics, the major variables or themes were the client's cognitive status (dementia and its accompanying problem behaviors), the client's mental or emotional state (diagnosed mental illness and its accompanying problem behaviors), and the client's personality characteristics that created difficulties for case managers and service providers. Under informal caregiver characteristics, the major categories were caregiver burnout or stress, the caregiver's personality characteristics, and a problematic relationship between caregiver and client. A second matrix to note the presence of these new variables or subcategories was created and the data were reviewed again to complete this matrix. The specific descriptions of each variable and item are outlined in  Table 1  . Results This section presents the seven common themes that were extracted from the cases and the problems accompanying them. The prevalence of these themes in the sample is noted and two case vignettes are provided to better illustrate the issues. One case could exhibit more than one theme. The screening tool items and data on interrater reliability and discriminant validity are presented in  Table 1  . Common Themes Clients With Dementia and Behavior Problems. Clients with dementia may exhibit behaviors that are difficult to manage. These behaviors include having poor judgment, being argumentative, being forgetful, getting easily confused, and wandering. Problems associated with these behaviors include noncompliance with treatment, resistance to care, mistrust of aides, and caregiver burnout. Twenty-seven percent (n = 19) of the cases belonged to this category. Clients With Mental Health Problems. Clients with mental health and substance abuse problems can be difficult to manage as they may engage in dangerous behaviors. For example, clients may exhibit paranoid or suicidal ideation, be noncompliant with treatment, and create difficulties for the aides who provide services. Chronic pain or physical problems may also create depression and/or substance abuse that need to be addressed. Twenty-seven percent (n = 19) of the cases belonged to this category. Clients with Difficult, Demanding Personality Characteristics. Some clients enter the long-term care system with lifelong personality characteristics or behaviors that are associated with dependent, borderline, or narcissistic personality disorders. Such behavior traits create difficulties for case managers and service providers. For example, clients who are very anxious may call the case manager every day or even several times a day; clients may expect more service than can be offered and be overly demanding. One client complained that the aides were "too dressed up to do their jobs." Another client only wanted an "American" male aide. Some clients are rude to the aides who then refuse to serve the clients. Other difficult characteristics include noncompliance with diet, medication, and other prescribed treatments not related to a diagnosis of dementia or mental illness. Twenty-four percent (n = 17) of the cases belonged to this category. Medically Frail Clients. Clients who had multiple diagnoses, were experiencing pain, had respiratory illnesses, and were prone to falling due to gait problems and dizziness appeared to require more case manager attention. These clients were likely to have more hospitalizations as there were either no informal caregivers or the caregivers did not know how to manage the client's condition and therefore sought hospitalization. Sixty-eight percent (n = 48) of the cases belonged to this category. Informal Caregiver Stress/Burnout. Informal caregivers are prone to experiencing burnout when they have other responsibilities. This is especially true when the client is medically frail and requires 24-hour care. Potential problems include the caregiver's own health problems, feelings of guilt and inadequacy, and depression. Twenty-eight percent (n = 20) of the cases belonged to this category. Problematic Caregiver Personality or Behaviors. Caregivers may be difficult to work with because they give false information about the client's finances or they misuse services by asking the aides to do extra work for the caregiver. Other caregivers can be very demanding, picky, and rigid about service provider schedules, which creates obvious strain on the service providers. In these situations case managers have to spend much time trying to work with caregivers and service providers to ensure the implementation of a care plan that meets the needs of the client. Twenty-three percent (n = 16) of the cases belonged to this category. Problematic Relationship Between Client and Informal Caregiver. When the caregiver herself has emotional problems, this may result in a hostile or strained relationship between client and caregiver. The caregiver can also be abusive or neglectful toward the client, especially when the caregiver depends on the client's income. Lack of family support or involvement with a client's care, or erratic, unreliable support also contributes to a difficult case management situation. Twenty-three percent (n = 16) of the cases belonged to this category. Summary. Thus, 34% of the cases (n = 28) had problematic caregiver characteristics, 27% (n = 19) had problematic client characteristics, and 27% (n = 19) had a combination of problematic client and caregiver characteristics. The remaining eight cases (11%) were related to medical frailty because of conditions that were difficult to manage or to situational problems, such as difficulty with locating appropriate service providers either due to staffing issues at the provider agency or the lack of services in more rural parts of the metropolitan area. Interrater Reliability and Discriminant Validity Based on the seven themes and their accompanying problems, nine items were developed into a screening tool to identify need for more intensive case management (see  Table 1  ). Based on previous research (Diwan 1999   ), we decided to tease out the impact of simply having a diagnosis of dementia and mental illness separately from having accompanying problem behaviors and emotions that might require more intensive case management.Selecting approximately half of the sample (n = 33), two raters noted the presence or absence of each item or variable in each case. Both raters were graduate students (one in social work, the other in counseling) with some clinical experience in gerontology. The coders noted the presence of a variable over a duration of a 12–18 month period. The problems could have been noted at the initial assessment or during the course of managing the case.Kappa scores were calculated for each variable to assess the degree of agreement between the raters on the nine items in the screening tool. In general, as  Table 1  indicates, there was high agreement on the coding of all variables (kappa ≥ .80 or above) except for the item that assessed the medical frailty of the client (kappa = .34).To assess the discriminant validity of the items, t tests were run for all items using an existing data set on the use of case management time. The following items were found to be significant: client's behavior problems; client's noncompliance with recommended treatment; client's psychological or emotional problems; caregiver's feeling of being stressed or burnt out; caregiver's difficult behaviors or personality traits; and a problematic relationship between client and caregiver. The two case vignettes in the Appendix provide a more complete picture of these issues as they arise in case management practice. Discussion This study extends previous work on high-risk or high-demand clients in long-term care by providing case managers with a brief, easy-to-use, empirically validated screening tool that helps case managers identify individuals in HCBS programs who need more intensive case management. As indicated in the Results, dementia and mental illness alone are not significant predictors of the need for intensive case management. Rather it is the presence of untreated psychological or behavioral issues that necessitates greater case management activity. Therefore, clients with dementia or mental illness would not automatically trigger a need for more intensive case management, but such clients would require additional oversight to monitor changing conditions. Furthermore, both informal and formal caregivers need to be trained to identify these problems early so that adequate care planning can be accomplished.Most HCBS programs use assessment tools that include standardized measures for functional ability, mood, social support, cognitive functioning, health, and disease. The assessment questions typically provide a profile of the client's unmet needs for HCBS services, but are seldom used to determine need for more intensive social work case management. The items presented in our brief assessment tool are based on existing questions used for assessment but have been modified to provide more useful information. This tool can be used at the time of initial assessment or reassessment to identify demanding cases. Most case management program guidelines require case managers to visit clients periodically (every 4–6 months) to review and adjust the care plan as needed. Using the tool at these care plan reviews would also help identify problems that require more intensive case management. However, problematic situations can arise at any point during the course of a client's stay in the program and typically these cases come to the case manager's attention because of the "squeaky" nature of their problems. Case managers need to be sensitized to these issues and trained to identify and respond to them as the need arises.There is some evidence in the literature that case managers do attend to high-risk clients by offering them service options that can better match their needs. For example, Hennessy 1989    describes case managers in a capitated long-term care program who could shift high-demand clients among various service options such as adult day care and assisted living to better meet the client's need for supervision. These options, however, relate to the use of different services rather than a different approach to case management, which is needed to address many of the other issues described earlier. Similarly, programs may also shift clients among colleagues when the need arises. However, few programs offer any specialized case management to address particular client needs.The advantage of an empirically derived screening tool is that it offers the basis for matching case management services to client needs and points to specific areas of intervention. The risk tool can be used to screen clients for whom clinical protocols need to be implemented. Whereas HCBS programs are geared to meet the physical care needs of older individuals (through the provision of in-home services), most find it difficult to adequately address psychological and behavioral issues that often jeopardize the client's ability to remain in the community. Classification of clients who require intensive case management services also sets up the foundation for research on interventions that address the clients' situations and meet the goals of the HCBS program. Such interventions include individual and family counseling, caregiver education and support for the management of dementia and other mental disorders, and the implementation of care management protocols that have been tested for their efficacy in producing the desired client outcomes. Case managers will need to be trained to use a variety of care management protocols that are available.One limitation of this tool is that the responses to the items depend somewhat on the case manager's subjective assessment of the client–caregiver relationship. Thus, inexperienced case managers may likely rate some issues as needing more time and skill or may have greater difficulty in addressing certain problems because of their personal experiences or lack of knowledge. Clemens and Hayes 1997    found a great deal of variability in case managers' subjective assessment of client risk. They note that the implicit use of "labels" for client behaviors and personality characteristics had an impact on the care recommendations that were made, leading to the possibility that similar clients would receive very different recommendations depending on their case managers. This issue needs to be addressed through training and supervision. That is, although the risk tool contains both objective and subjective indicators of problematic situations, identifying problematic cases then allows for a more objective response through the triggering of specific protocols designed to address specific needs. One practice that has already been instituted in this case management agency is the use of case conferences to discuss difficult clients and "clinical" supervision for case managers who are struggling with these and other issues. These practice methods together with a standardized and empirically validated risk assessment tool can be instrumental in reducing the variability in care plan recommendations that are attributed to case manager knowledge and experience.Given that many cases may go through crisis episodes that can be stabilized for a period of time, a team approach to case management may offer one way to successfully manage large and diverse caseloads. For example, in some agencies, a nurse, a social worker, and a case aide are part of a team that manages a client (Eggert et al. 1990   ). The aide handles routine case management tasks, thereby freeing the nurse and social worker to focus on more acute problems that require greater intervention skills.The lack of significance of the variable assessing medical frailty points to areas for further study, that is, how to identify clients who need a greater level of medical or nursing case management. This variable had low interrater reliability and discriminant validity. This may partly be explained by the fact that the coders' professional affiliations were social work and counseling rather than nursing, which could have influenced their coding. However, a more significant problem in identifying such cases is the lack of adequate indicators and documentation of these indicators in the client's chart. Given that social work case managers have the most frequent ongoing contact with the clients, this case management program is working to develop a set of indicators whereby the case manager can identify and call for greater nursing oversight for medically frail clients.Thus, identification of clients in need of more intensive case management is consistent with the ecological approach of looking at the person-in-environment. Tailoring case management services to meet client needs should enable clients to stay in the community longer, experience better quality of life, and have greater satisfaction with the home care program. Case Vignettes Case 1 A 90-year-old female client, who did not have a formal diagnosis of dementia, began to manifest behaviors such as forgetfulness and confusion. At the beginning of this case, the client appeared friendly and talkative. Her home was neatly maintained and she kept herself active with exercise. She lived alone but had very supportive neighbors. Due to a decrease in mobility related to her arthritis, she needed some assistance with ADLs and IADLs. Overall, her physical health was good as she had one diagnosis of arthritis and one prescribed medication to relieve its symptoms. As the case continued, there was a question of a small stroke or TIA. She began to exhibit agitated behavior including verbal abuse, cursing, and racial slurs, all of which were directed toward the case manager and aides. Increased confusion and forgetfulness became evident when the client would accuse the staff of stealing items, including stockings and nightgowns from the home only to find them later. The client was easily angered and difficult to please. Eventually, aides began to refuse to return to the home. This left the case manager with the task of re-brokering for services to keep the client within her home. Several calls were also made to the client's physician for further input on the case. The client and case manager began to look into alternative living arrangements as it became clear that the client was at considerable risk living alone. Case 2 A 78-year-old widowed woman, diagnosed as having dementia, was accepted into the program. She was noted to be alert, friendly, cooperative, and she needed assistance with ADLs and 24-hour supervision. The client lived with her daughter (the primary caregiver), a recently divorced mother with one son. The caregiver struggled with physical problems including wrist, back and neck pain for which she had some surgery. From the beginning, the caregiver's behavior was noted as being demanding, argumentative and difficult to appease. The case manager noted the caregiver's tendency to be irrational, to make quick accusations of discrimination, and threats of legal action. There were multiple calls to the case manager on a daily basis both from the caregiver and the provider agencies that often resulted in services being rebrokered. Over a 5-month period, services were re-brokered seven times. At one point, the caregiver filed a complaint against the senior center's transportation rather than accommodating the center's request for a compromise related to the services provided to the client. Another incident resulted in an aide being arrested after the caregiver filed charges of breaking and entering and burglary. The charges were eventually dismissed but it required a change of agencies. Eventually, other agencies refused services to the client for fear of legal action by the caregiver. Due to the intensity of the case, the case management supervisor was asked to intervene. The program considered not continuing to broker in-home services due to the frequent caregiver accusations. The difficult behaviors of the caregiver decreased somewhat over time but she continued to demand that aides do work that was beyond their mandate. Throughout the case narrative, very few of the case manager's extensive efforts were directly related to the client's needs, but rather to managing the informal caregiver whose support was necessary to keep the client in the community.

     Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDIn federal Fiscal Year (FY) 2000, Medicaid long-term care expenditures increased 8.6%, from $62.3 billion to $67.7 billion (see  Table 1  ). This was higher than the rates of increase in long-term care spending over the prior 2 years, which were in the 5% to 6% range. Medicaid long-term care expenditures increased at a slightly higher rate than overall Medicaid spending, which increased 7.9%, from $180.1 billion to $194.3 billion.Medicaid spending for nursing home care increased by 8.8% to $39.6 billion. As shown in  Table 1  , the growth in expenditures for nursing home care has been increasing over the last 4 years, but is still considerably below the rates of increase that occurred during the early 1990s. Spending for intermediate care facility—mental retardation (ICF-MR) care increased by 3.3%. Overall, however, Medicaid spending for ICF-MR care has remained relatively flat over the last 5 years.Home- and community-based services (HCBS) waivers, which increased 14.6% in FY 2000 to $12.0 billion, are still the most rapidly growing Medicaid long-term care benefit. Spending for personal care services increased 7.6% in FY 2000 to $3.8 billion. Medicaid expenditures for skilled home health care services remained relatively flat in FY 2000, as they have in recent years.Overall, Medicaid spending for institutional services (nursing home care plus ICF-MR care) comprised 73% of all Medicaid long-term care spending in FY 2000, whereas spending for community-based services (personal care, HCBS waivers, and home health services) comprised 27% of total expenditures. Table 2  arrays the state-specific rates for these Medicaid long-term care services. The top five states in long-term care per capita expenditures in 2000 were New York, Connecticut, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, with North Dakota replacing Washington, DC, from 1999 to 2000. Table 3  presents the state-specific data for total Medicaid expenditures arrayed in order of per capita rates. The top four states for both 1999 and 2000 had per capita rates above $1,000 (New York, Washington, DC, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts). The bottom three for both years had rates below $400 (Nevada, Utah, and Virginia).Additional data are available from the author. All these data are derived from HCFA 64 reports (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2000   , Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2001   ) submitted by states to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration). The HCFA 64 is the form used by states to claim federal financial participation for state Medicaid outlays and is audited by the federal government. It is thus considered to be one of the most reliable sources of information on state Medicaid spending. However, it is important to reiterate some caveats in the interpretation of these data.First, HCFA 64 data are filed by date of payment, not date of service. Thus, rates of change in state Medicaid spending for specific services, as reported on the HCFA 64, can be related to state payment policies as well as to real changes in service utilization by Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, simply by delaying one month's payments to nursing home providers from June 30th to July 1st, a state can push 13 months of nursing home spending into a later fiscal year, leaving only 11 months of nursing home payments in the earlier year. These kinds of "bill paying" practices definitely occur in some states, usually in response to budgetary pressures.Second, HCFA 64 reports represent state claims to the federal government of health care expenditures that states believe are eligible for federal matching funds under the Medicaid program. As a result of its audit process, HCFA may disallow some of these claims as not eligible for federal matching funds, which are then adjusted on future HCFA 64 reports. These adjustments are not reported by type of service and, therefore, cannot be used to adjust previously reported data on Medicaid spending by type of service.Third, HCFA 64 reports on Medicaid spending by type of service only represent Medicaid fee-for-service spending, not spending for services provided through capitated managed-care programs. Because long-term care recipients (and/or long-term care benefits) are usually exempt from participation in Medicaid managed-care programs, the growth in managed-care enrollment should not have a large impact on HCFA 64 reports of spending for long-term care services. However, Arizona's entire long-term care system is capitated, and the author-available tables only include fee-for-service expenditures in Arizona's long-term care system (persons newly eligible for long-term care services in Arizona may receive long-term care services on a fee-for-service basis before enrolling in a managed-care plan). In addition, a few other states (e.g., Minnesota and Texas) have recently implemented relatively large managed-care long-term care programs that pay for services on a capitation basis. Also, increased enrollment of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families-related recipients and Supplemental Security Income recipients who are not dual eligibles into managed-care programs may be affecting reported spending on the HCFA 64 for personal care and Medicaid home-health benefits.Lastly, HCFA 64 reports on long-term care expenditures are sometimes erroneous. States occasionally call and question the data reported in the annual MEDSTAT memorandum (e.g., Burwell 2000   ), particularly in regard to HCFA 64 reports on HCBS waiver spending. In some cases, this is because HCBS waiver expenditures are reported on another line of the HCFA 64, usually the "Other" service line. The MEDSTAT Group has produced another memorandum (Eiken and Burwell 2001   ), which summarizes HCFA 64 reports on expenditures for individ-ual waiver programs. Most states operate multiple HCBS waiver programs for different long-term care populations.  None  Table 1.

     Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe Bush Administration has proposed an increase of 13.4% in funding to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to a total of $23.112 billion in Fiscal Year 2002, which was also included in the budget resolution passed by Congress. Some lawmakers and interest groups hope to see an even greater increase in funding. The final amount will be decided during this year's appropriations process. In any case, it is essential that aging research, which currently comprises roughly 7% of all NIH funding, becomes a greater priority. There are many unanswered questions about what causes the adverse effects associated with aging, and even about what exactly aging is. Research can provide us with answers to these questions by improving our understanding of the mechanisms of aging as well as the causes and treatments of age-related diseases. Given the growing size of our aging population coupled with increases in longevity, a significant investment in aging research will promote the development of effective interventions to prevent or retard adverse aspects of the aging experience—and improve the quality of life of all older Americans. The Federal Government Census Bureau. The Census Bureau (Bureau of the Census 2001a   ) reported that the median age of the U.S. population in 2000 was 35.3 years, the highest it has ever been. The median age was 32.9 years in the 1990 census. The most rapid increase in size of any age group was a 49% jump in the 45–54-year-old population, which represents the aging baby boomer population. The Census Bureau is also releasing state and local-level data (Bureau of the Census 2001b   ). Cholesterol. The National Cholesterol Education Program (National Cholesterol Education Program 2001   ) of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the NIH has issued new guidelines on the prevention and management of cholesterol in adults. The guidelines significantly increase the number of people who would be candidates for drug therapy, potentially tripling the number of people on cholesterol-lowering drugs to 36 million. In addition, the guidelines stress the need for better nutrition, weight control and physical activity, all of which improve various heart disease risk factors. Disability. A study appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Manton and Lu 2001   ) indicates that the rate of chronic disability among older Americans is declining. The report found that the rate of chronic disability among people aged older than 65 years was 26.2% in 1982 and fell to 19.7% in 1999, with an accelerated annual rate of decline between 1994 and 1999. The absolute number of disabled individuals was 7.1 million in 1982, increased to 7.5 million in 1994, but then declined to 7 million by 1999, despite an increase in the total number of individuals older than 65. In addition, the report found that disability rates declined by a greater percentage among African Americans than White people, and that fewer people are living in nursing homes, both as a proportion of the older population and in absolute numbers. Among other issues, the report raises important considerations for the future financing of the Medicare program. Institute of Medicine. The Institute of Medicine (Wizeman and Pardue 2001   ) has released a report that considers the factors and traits that characterize and differentiate males and females across the life span and that underlie sex differences in health. It contains a series of findings and conclusions that emphasize that men and women differ in physiological and chemical ways, and these sex differences should be important considerations in all aspects of biomedical and health-related research. Medicare/Anesthesia. The Bush Administration announced it is undoing a Clinton regulation allowing trained nurses, certified nurse-anesthetists, to give anesthesia to Medicare beneficiaries without the supervision of a physician (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001b   ). The revised regulation would revert to the longstanding requirement that nurse-anesthetists may administer anesthesia only when a physician is present, but it will allow states to be exempt from the requirement if they already have a law allowing the nurse-anesthetists to work alone. MedPAC. The chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC), Gail Wilensky, has left the group and has been replaced by Glenn Hackbarth. The change was made by the comptroller general of the United States in an attempt to provide some turnover in the leadership of the commission. National Institute on Aging (NIA). The NIA's Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center (National Institute on Aging 2001   ) has released its Progress Report on Alzheimer's Disease 2000: Taking the Next Steps. The report provides a description of current knowledge of Alzheimer's disease and discusses the outlook for future Alzheimer's research. Social Security Commission. President Bush has announced the members of his bipartisan commission on Social Security (White House 2001   ). The sixteen-member commission consists of eight Republicans and Democrats and is co-chaired by former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and AOL/Time Warner Chief Operating Officer Richard Parsons. The commission will issue a final report this fall containing specific recommendations for reform, which are expected to include the creation of private retirement accounts. Surgeon General. Surgeon General David Satcher (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001a   ) unveiled National Strategy on Suicide Prevention, which contains a variety of recommendations intended to reduce the number of suicides. Among other findings, the report notes that older people have the highest suicide rate, and organizations with special access to the older population have an important role in suicide prevention. News From Abroad Canada. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (Canadian Institute for Health Information 2001   ) has released its annual report Health Care in Canada 2001. The report provides new and updated information on key measures of health and health care for 63 of the largest health regions in Canada, representing 90% of the country's population. Among other highlights, the report notes that: (a) the Canadian life expectancy of 79 years ranks it near the top of all nations, (b) large disparities in treatment and life expectancy exist in different parts of Canada, and (c) childhood obesity is on the rise. Germany. The recent court decision that Germany's public long-term care insurance program is unconstitutional has affected the debate over Germany's public pension reform plan. The pension plan reform approved in January 2001 would create a private retirement system to complement the public plan. However, it could be derailed as it undergoes final negotiations with the states because of concerns about its constitutionality resulting from the court decision. The court had ruled that the funding formula for long-term care insurance was in violation of a constitutional guarantee to promote the family and said that premiums should be lower for adults with children, as they were helping to finance the future of the program by having children. Opponents of the pension reform plan believe that this concept applies to the pension plan also, whereas supporters believe that the financing system ensures equity for all. Holland. Holland is experiencing a stagnation of increasing life expectancy—falling behind other European nations in terms of life expectancy for its citizens, according to a recent study (van der Wilk, Achterberg, and Kramers 2001   ). The study authors conclude that high smoking rates in Holland are the main factor for the stagnation. Nursing. A new study in the May/June issue of Health Affairs (Aiken et al. 2001   ) indicates that nurses in other countries, as well as the U.S., share the same frustrations, including staffing shortages, limited input, and dissatisfaction with patient care. The study examined nurses working in acute care hospitals in Canada, England, Germany, Scotland, and the United States. Stem Cells. Germany's main research funding agen-cy (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 2001   ) has issued new guidelines that allow German researchers to import human embryonic stem cells from other countries. German law currently prohibits the derivation of such stem cells from embryos fertilized in vitro. However, the agency also recommends that this law be changed if the importation of embryonic stem cells is insufficient. United Nations (UN). The UN has established a website to provide information and news about the Second World Assembly on Ageing, to be held in Madrid in April 2002.

     Abstract Medical autopsy rates have been declining for the past several decades, yet, for more than a decade, the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center has been recruiting healthy older adults into a program involving annual assessments of mental status, biannual medical and neurological exams, and prearranged postmortem brain examination. The present article focuses on the characteristics of these donors to explore potential factors that contribute to the decision to donate. The motivations of this unique group of individuals could serve to inform physicians who request autopsies for medical and research purposes. Over 500 volunteers who have enrolled in this program are well-educated community-dwelling adults over the age of 60. They are generally motivated by personal experiences with Alzheimer's disease, referral by someone already enrolled, and a desire to promote scientific knowledge. These volunteers' reasons suggest that rates of tissue donation or autopsy for basic research and investigations of causes of death might be increased by providing individuals and families with information concerning the medical and scientific value of the procedure. Within research settings, encouraging participant recruitment of friends or family members would likely increase tissue acquisition rates.   Alzheimer's disease ,  Autopsy ,  Organ donation ,  Senile plaques ,  Neurofibrillary tangles ,  Cognition Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe acquisition of brain autopsies for research purposes is an important endeavor in research on aging. This process is crucial for understanding the morphological and biochemical changes occurring with normal brain aging and for comparison of these alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) associated with dementing conditions. Though procurement of CNS tissues from normal individuals is recognized as an important component of research, information is lacking about how this goal might be accomplished.Two literatures that shed light on this problem concern autopsy requests for postmortem diagnosis and cadaver organ donation. There are similarities and dissimilarities in these literatures in relation to the acquisition of normal brain specimens. Recent literature regarding autopsy referrals has predominantly focused on pathological diagnoses as opposed to the investigation of normal tissues for research. Some of the reasons most often cited for the agreement to perform an autopsy in a hospital setting include the identification or confirmation of the cause of death, advancement of medical knowledge or medical education, and certification that appropriate medical care was provided (Grunberg, Sherrod, Muellenbach, Renshaw, Zaretsky, and Levine 1994   ; Harris, Ismail, Dilly, and Maxwell 1993   ; McPhee, Bottles, Lo, Saika, and Crommie 1986   ). Consent for autopsy may be limited by public misconceptions that autopsies are more important or informative in forensic cases than in deaths that are due to medical disorders (McManus and Wood 1996   ). With organ donation, motives tend to be less concrete and are related to personal values and attitudes (Horton and Horton 1991   ), often in regard to transplantation (Chabalewski and Norris 1994   ). Barriers to obtaining permission for autopsy are also important. Physician attitudes and training as well as families' beliefs and needs appear to contribute to the decision to permit an autopsy. McPhee and colleagues 1986    suggested that barriers to obtaining consent for autopsy include concerns about possible body disfigurement, a family member's stress surrounding the death and granting of permission, other family members' objections, and a general lack of information about the autopsy procedure. Physicians also often fail to request an autopsy. Apparent barriers to approaching a family for autopsy permission include a fear of litigation, discomfort on the part of the physician, beliefs regarding the family's reaction, and the lack of training in obtaining consent as well as in the importance of an autopsy (Grunberg et al. 1994   ; Katz and Seidel 1990   ; McManus, Suvalsky, and Wilson 1992   ; Rosenbaum, Burns, Johnson, Mitchell, Robinson, and Truog 2000   ; Souza and Rosner 1997   ; Wilkes, Link, Jacobs, Fortin, and Felix 1990   ). McPhee 1996    and others (Schneiderman and Gruhn 1985   ) have suggested the need to improve communication between families and physicians as well as the need to educate all parties concerned on the importance of autopsy. Given the motivations for postmortem evaluations in a hospital setting and organ donation, it is not surprising that obtaining autopsies from normal individuals for the expressed purpose of research presents a unique problem beyond that of pathological diagnosis of conditions contributing to mortality.Autopsy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is primarily directed toward the neuropathological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. Even with the accuracy of clinical diagnosis ranging from approximately 80% to 90% (Blacker, Albert, Bassett, Go, Harrell, and Folstein 1994   ; Galasko et al. 1994   ; Katzman 1988   ; Kukull, Larson, Reifler, Lampe, Yerby, and Hughes 1990   ; Victoroff, Mack, Lyness, and Chui 1995   ), definitive diagnosis of AD requires neuropathological confirmation. In addition to establishing a diagnosis of AD or another dementing condition, autopsy provides tissue samples for analyses focusing on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms and causes of AD. Therefore, autopsy in AD is often the core element for research in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) funded by the National Institute on Aging. Many of the ADRC projects involve study of the AD brain for structural, biochemical, and clinical clues regarding the nature of this disorder and, similar to medical autopsies, provide a definitive diagnosis for the family. Through the cooperation of family members of the AD patient, the ADRCs have been able to study a large number of brains from victims of AD and associated disorders. However, there has been a critical shortage of control brains from prospectively evaluated cognitively normal individuals available for neuropathological and biochemical comparison with tissues from demented individuals. Only a very modest number of postmortem studies of the aging brain have appeared in the literature, and many have not included prospectively studied older adults with "normal" mentation (Davis, Schmitt, Wekstein, and Markesbery 1999   ). Given that senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (hallmarks of AD) in varying densities in the brain have been described in normal older adults, the association of these changes due to aging, dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and possible "preclinical" AD is unclear. Recent research suggests that clinically identified change in memory without other symptoms of dementia often evolves into clinical AD within a few years (Morris et al. 2001   ). Brain donation from well-studied, nondemented individuals can further our understanding of the brain changes in aging and dementing conditions.Since 1989, we have recruited neurologically normal older adults who have agreed to donate their brains following death. This report describes some possible motivations for and against older adults granting permission for brain donation in a normal aging population that could serve as the basis for other research projects investigating changes in the brain associated with the aging process. We propose the term brain tissue acquisition, as the act of donating normal brain tissue for research purposes possesses qualities of both autopsy and organ donation. Understanding the factors behind this decision-making process are important, because there is a shortage of control brains nationally. Further, the national autopsy rate (in general) has been in decline over the past several years (Powers, Powell, Schlough, and Whitehouse 1989   ), and an organ-donor shortage also exists (Jaynes and Springer 1994   ). Methods Participants For the last 16 years, the University of Kentucky Sanders-Brown Center on Aging has maintained a pool of research volunteers. This pool consists of 4,131 persons over the age of 60 who reside in the immediate geographical area of the ADRC and have agreed in principle to be research participants. This pool was initially created in 1984 by contacting registered voters in this region. General characteristics of this group of individuals are shown in  Table 1  . Recruitment for the current project began in the Fall of 1989. In the Fall of 2000, members in this study submitted names for the project and voted to call this project the Biologically Resilient Adults in Neurological Studies (BRAiNS) program.The present sample of community-dwelling volunteers reflects 504 persons over the age of 60 who were recruited from 1,305 contacts by letter and from 393 contacts through personal referrals and media publicity from the overall group. The majority of the research volunteer group members at the time of study enrollment were married, were between the ages of 60 and 97, and considered themselves to be in good health (see  Table 1  ). Given resource limitations, a decision was made to follow a maximum of 500 living individuals in this cohort at any given time. Participants who die or are lost to follow-up are replaced to maintain this level of study enrollment. Replacement of individuals in this cohort continues to be based on local media presentations. Procedure To recruit persons for this project, we sent a personal letter from the ADRC to persons in the research volunteer pool explaining the critical need for understanding the cause or causes of AD. It also summarized how these goals might be promoted through the study of brain tissue from a normal older person. The letter specifically informed potential participants that they would be asked to take annual mental-status examinations to document the absence of cognitive symptoms normally associated with dementia and to agree to "donate" their brain following their death. This letter also specifically stated that the autopsy would be performed at no cost to the volunteer and that the brain donation was not disfiguring and that it would not require a change in either the type of funeral the individual desired or the timing of the funeral.Within approximately 1 week following the receipt of the letter, each potential volunteer was contacted by telephone. At this time the potential participant was provided with an opportunity to ask questions about study procedures and autopsy. They were then asked questions based on NINCDS/ADRDA criteria (McKhann, Drachman, Folstein, Katzman, Price, and Stadlan 1984   ) related to their mental and physical condition to determine their study eligibility. If it was mutually agreeable, a home visit was made with the individual to review and sign the informed-consent document, a donor card ( Fig. 1 ), and to obtain baseline mental-status testing.After obtaining written informed consent (approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board), we gave those persons who had agreed to participate in the study and who also met the screening criteria a set of brief cognitive tests (see  Table 2  for criteria and tests). Volunteers with a history of neurological disease, major psychiatric illness, or substance abuse were excluded from the study. Eligibility was further determined from mental status scores (e.g., a Mini-Mental State Exam score above 24; Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ). Volunteers who qualified as donors and consented to the study procedures are retested on an annual basis and receive biannual neurological and physical examinations. They are also contacted by telephone at 6-month intervals in an effort to maintain contact and determine that there have been no significant changes in their health status.Volunteers who remained eligible after their initial screening also signed a form (in addition to the consent document) indicating their agreement to donate their brain and, in most cases, other organs to the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging. Volunteers also agreed to inform significant others including their next-of-kin, physician, and funeral director concerning their donation decision and enrollment in the study.As a part of the screening and recruitment procedures for this study, all potential participants (members of the research volunteer pool) who were contacted by telephone were also asked questions to understand their reasons for agreeing or not agreeing to participate. Results To date, 1,507 of the research volunteers have been contacted about the brain donation program, and 583 (38.7%) have enrolled as donors. Direct mailings resulted in an 18% enrollment rate (186 of 1,031 letter or phone contacts enrolled after meeting criteria) and an additional 397 enrolled through referrals from study participants and local media coverage of the program. In the direct mailing, 274 persons were unable to be contacted by telephone to set up a home visit. The primary reasons were that these people had either died or moved away from the area or the telephone number was no longer valid. Of those who agreed to donation, 255 (50.7%) did so because they had family (39.9%) or friends (10.7%) with AD. The second most common reason provided was the personal referral by another participant (31.8%), and the third was the donor's decision on cremation (15.5%) or closed casket funeral (1.8%) after death, and the perception that the brain donation would not interfere with this plan. Other reasons included the donor's previous relationship with either the University of Kentucky (14.3%) or the health care community (12.3%) or a concern about their own memory (6.2%). Note that these proportions do not equal 100 given that some volunteers provided more than one reason for enrolling in the project.Of the 843 persons contacted by mail who were not enrolled, 19% (161) were ineligible because of health reasons or exclusion criteria. Refusal without a reason was indicated by 432 (51.2%) of the contacts. An additional 10% (84) stated they would agree, but that family members objected. Other reasons for refusal included objections to the testing (6%, or 51), the perception that they were "not healthy enough" (103, or 12.2%), and the fact that some (1.4%) had already agreed to donate their bodies for medical research through another department at the medical school. In the case of the personal and local media referrals, only 75 of the 393 contacts could not be enrolled primarily because of our exclusion criteria.Since the inception of this program, 38 of the volunteers (7.5% of the group) have withdrawn from the project. The most common reasons for discontinuation were for personal reasons including a change of mind regarding autopsy (31.5%), moving out of the area (39.5%), family pressure about the postmortem examination (13.2%), and declining health requiring institutionalization (15.8%). Discussion The recruitment method used in the BRAiNS project appears to be successful as measured by the numbers of brain donations acquired for autopsy. To date, there have been 131 deaths and 114 autopsies (87% autopsy rate). A description of the autopsy findings in the first 59 cases in this series has recently been presented (Davis et al. 1999   ; Schmitt et al. 2000   ). Given the declining trend for autopsy in the hospital setting, the willingness to enroll in an autopsy program that does not provide a diagnosis of medical conditions is unique and may reflect several factors. It also differs from the autopsy components of many ADRCs because the majority of these volunteers do not develop clinical symptoms of dementia. Further, this project and its procedures helped in the development of another study of brain aging with the School Sisters of Notre Dame (Nun Study; Butler and Snowdon 1996   ).The typical donor in the present study was a woman aged 70–79 with 13 or more years of education who reported "excellent" or "good" health. The primary motivating factor for agreeing to postmortem examination was personal knowledge of a person with AD. This motivation is undoubtedly the expression of a desire to help others by finding a cause, cure, or treatment for AD similar to attitudes that promote autopsy in the hospital setting (McPhee et al. 1986   ; Connell, Avey, and Holmes 1994   ).It is also possible that the donors in the present study are motivated by values and attitudinal factors. Altruistic values (Horton and Horton 1991   ), a sense of purpose and fulfillment (Clancey 1994   ), and something good (life) coming from tragedy (death; Clancey 1994   ; Eizenga and Luukkonen 1993   ) have all been found to be related to organ donation. These variables may be related to our volunteers finding purpose in their own deaths with their donation. On the basis of these observations, a second project designed to assess altruism in some of our volunteers is underway.In viewing brain acquisition in relation to organ donation, another reason for success could be the donor card that is provided to the volunteer. The possession of a donor card has been found to be a predictive factor of organ donation (Horton and Horton 1991   ). This concurs with McPhee 1996    call for improved communication and education for both health care professionals and the public about the importance of autopsy. With this in mind, our ADRC routinely provides information regarding the use of the requested brain tissue to health professionals and the public through seminars and lectures. We also provide regular study updates through newsletters and presentations to our volunteers (and prospective volunteers) concerning research on AD. Imparting knowledge through these means (with accompanying coverage in the local news media) may be a factor in maintaining and recruiting additional volunteers for brain acquisition.Another possible reason for success in recruiting older adults for a prearranged autopsy program is simply that a request was made. The topic of autopsy is often difficult for both physicians and families, and therefore often avoided (Rosenbaum et al. 2000   ). McPhee and colleagues 1986    found that the single most common cause for not having an autopsy performed was simply the failure of professionals to request one. This also appears to be the case for African American families, who were less likely to be approached for organ donation than the families of White patients, and consent to organ donation varied by type of death, geographic location, and type of hospital (Guadagnoli, McNamara, Evanisko, Beasley, Callender, and Poretsky 1999   ). It is possible, therefore, that our request communicates value to an older adult, especially in a society in which emphasis is placed on youth. For example, McPhee and colleagues 1986    found that the majority of autopsies (62%) were performed for the pediatric hospital service. It is unclear, however, whether more autopsies were being requested by physicians from this service or by families. An autopsy request from our ADRC may therefore communicate the importance that is placed on health issues and quality of life for the elderly by physicians and scientists.In considering demographics of our participants, it is important to note that the majority of the volunteer pool consists of well-educated, middle-to-upper-class Whites. Other cultures or groups may not value autopsy as highly. For example, in a study of Mexican Americans, Perkins, Supik, and Hazuda 1993    found that this group questioned the medical benefits of autopsy and were less willing to grant autopsies that benefited only people outside the family. Religious beliefs were also in opposition to autopsy. Many individuals in this group placed great import on the whole, "unmutilated" cadaver and believed that the soul lingered in the cadaver for a period of time after death. Clearly, autopsy would interfere with these beliefs. Further, requesting autopsy before death, as in this study, was often believed to hasten death. Organ donation in this Hispanic population has been possibly affected by culture also, as most organ procurement workers are Caucasian (Rene, Viera, Daniels, and Santos 1994   ). Consideration of the culture (including ethnicity and religion) of the population from whom tissue is being requested is therefore important in the design of successful recruitment procedures. Multilingual informed consent forms and patient-education materials may facilitate cross-cultural communication about the benefits of autopsy and the specific medical procedures involved. However, Rosenbaum and colleagues 2000    found in a recent survey of U.S. teaching hospitals that fewer than 6% offered multilingual forms.Family objections are often reported in the literature as reasons for autopsy rejection. Ten percent of respondents when initially contacted did not agree to autopsy because of family objections and some enrollees later withdrew consent for a similar set of reasons. One recent survey (Sanner 1994   ) found that 62% of respondents were willing to donate their own organs, while significantly fewer (39%) were willing to donate organs of a family member. In regard to autopsy, however, the proportion of autopsy acceptance for self and family members was similar. Sanner 1994    suggested a range of positive opinions toward postmortem procedures of autopsy, organ donation, and dissection. It is possible that the request for brain donation represents yet another point on this continuum. Family opinion obviously plays a much larger role when autopsy is not requested until after a patient death. In these cases, the amount and type of information provided, or withheld, about the autopsy procedure may increase family distress (Rosenbaum et al. 2000   ). Involving family members in advance planning has been suggested as one intervention for educating significant others (Connell et al. 1994   ; McPhee 1996   ).Data from a similar project have shown that the rate of brain donation among older adults is associated with chronological age (Kaye, Dame, Lehman, and Sexton 1999   ). In Kaye and colleagues' project, persons over the age of 85 are almost twice as likely (62%) to consent to brain donation when first approached about donation when compared with their younger counterparts of ages 65 to 75 (36%). Factors such as religiosity, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic status did not dramatically contribute in this decision to donate.The success of the current recruiting efforts at the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging and prominent features of the sample obtained suggest that autopsy and tissue donation requests benefit from consideration of the target population's demographic characteristics, values, beliefs, and religious constraints. Clinicians and researchers are likely to obtain increased donation rates by asking potential donors before death or illness, whenever possible. Providing information emphasizing the donation's advancement of medical or scientific knowledge, potential benefit to others with specific illness, and specific types of donation (e.g., brain only or whole body) at the time of the request might tap into the reasons commonly endorsed by volunteer donors. Directly addressing cultural or religious concerns with the procedure in the primary language of the potential donor would increase the relevance of the information presented. Finally, offering donor cards and encouraging or facilitating family discussion of the decision to undergo autopsy or tissue donation is likely to increase volunteer acquisition and retention.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose of the Study: This study sought to increase knowledge about the impact of rater role on the assessment of in-home supportive care. The authors compared the perspectives of care recipients and professionals on one aspect of the broad concept of quality of care in home care—the sufficiency of the amount of care provided by informal and formal caregivers. Design and Method: Sufficiency of home care was assessed through concurrent elderly persons' self-report through telephone interview and nurse clinical report based on in-home interviews with the elder. Care was assessed in terms of the sufficiency of the amount of informal and formal assistance received to meet functional dependency needs. Statistical analyses compared the ratings of elder and professional. Results: Professional ratings of the sufficiency of care were significantly lower than those of the elderly care recipients. From the perspective of both care recipients and professionals, sufficiency of care was significantly related to coresidence of elder and caregiver, and to caregiver health. Implications: Consistent with previous literature, rater role was found to influence the assessment of the sufficiency of in-home care. Researchers and providers should recognize that care recipient and professional ratings are not interchangeable.   Quality of home care ,  Rater role ,  Measurement of quality of care Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDAs the home-care industry has grown, so too have concerns about the quality of in-home care (Applebaum, Mollica, and Tilley 1997   –1998). In response, the health and human service sectors have stepped up efforts to assess and improve quality of care (Applebaum 1995   ). Although family and friends provide considerably more care than formal providers (Kosberg and Cairl 1992   ; Morrow-Howell, Proctor, Dore, and Kaplan 1998   ; Strawbridge and Wallhagen 1992   ), relatively little attention has focused on assessing and improving the quality of in-home care provided by the informal sector.As with the assessment of quality of care in general, research on the quality of home care is challenged by definitional issues (Capitman, Abrahams, and Ritter 1997   ). Reflecting the complexity of the concept "quality of care," different criteria are used to define and measure quality (McGlynn 1997   ). Accordingly, there is lack of consensus as to what constitutes quality home care. Further challenges surround the issue of who should rate quality. Which home care consumer should be considered in assessing quality (Applebaum et al. 1997   –1998), and which stakeholders should rate quality?This study seeks to increase knowledge about the variance in the assessment of quality of home care related to rater role. There are many roles assumed by people related to the home care industry—care recipient, informal caregiver, professional caregivers, clinical case managers, financial case managers, etc. We seek to understand if people systematically view and thus rate home care quality differently, depending on their role. Specifically, we focus on two raters: care recipients and professionals. Among the many potential domains of quality of care, we focus on one: the sufficiency of the amount of care provided by informal and formal caregivers to meet the dependency needs of frail elders in activities of daily living (ADL). Related Literature Conceptions and Indicators of Quality Various attributes are used to conceptualize and evaluate the quality of care. With respect to health care in general, Donabedian 1992    identified six attributes of quality: effectiveness, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, legitimacy, and equity. The aspect of health care addressed in this study, home care, has been typically evaluated in terms of prevented nursing home placements, costs, and such elder outcomes as functional status and mortality. Attention to more proximal indicators of quality, particularly features of the in-home care per se, is more recent. For example, Ory and Duncker 1992    called for reconceptualizing outcomes to include the adequacy of care. Morrow-Howell, Proctor, and Berg-Weger 1993    addressed the adequacy of informal care for elderly patients discharged home from the hospital, documenting concerns that discharge planners expressed about informal caregivers' abilities to perform the tasks expected of them in posthospital care.Health care has also been evaluated in terms of the extent to which services meet needs for assistance, an aspect of quality that may be particularly germane to care recipients. McGlynn 1997    noted that patients tend to evaluate care in terms of its responsiveness to their individual needs. Morrow-Howell, Proctor, and Dore 1998    conceptualized adequacy in terms of the extent to which services meet needs for assistance. Consistent with this approach, Skinner, Steinwachs, Handley, and colleagues (1999) postulated that outcomes of care (for persons with severe and persistent mental illness) would be better when services meet needs for assistance. Particularly in postacute care, meeting needs for functional assistance is an important component of quality. Over the past 2 decades there have been trends for patients leaving the hospital after shorter stays at higher levels of dependency and with increased need for care (Coe et al. 1986   ; Kosekoff et al. 1990   ). Mamon and colleagues 1992    found that 97% of patients discharged home after hospitalization had need for care at 2 weeks postdischarge. Stakeholder Perspectives on Quality As McGlynn 1997    has noted, "quality is in the eye of the beholder; that is, expectations and the value associated with different aspects of care are likely to vary among different stakeholders" (p. 9). In assessing the quality of home care, the relevant perspectives include those of the elder-care recipient, any one of a number of family members (some providing care and some not), and the formal care providers (the home care aides themselves, their supervisors, or the care managers; Wagner 1988   ). Additionally, funders and regulators are key stakeholders. Each of the various constituencies or stakeholders in the home-care industry has a legitimate and perhaps unique perspective; their motivations, values, and criteria may be truly different (Kaufert 1983   ). Each perspective may be differentially important in planning or evaluating programs and services. For example, discrepancy between the need for a service (as assessed by providers) and the demand for that service (as expressed by consumers) is critical in program planning; that is, there is a risk that services will be structured by providers for hypothetical target populations (Wilson and Netting 1987   ). Patient perspective, particularly patient satisfaction, has been regarded as an "indispensable" reflection of the quality of care (Donabedian 1988   , p. 1746); and Skinner, Steinwachs, Handley, and colleagues (1999) noted that by "listening to the consumer and designing systems of care that are more responsive to meeting needs defined by the consumer, more effective—and accountable—delivery systems are likely" (p. 117). Yet particularly in gerontology, in which elderly subjects may be too sick or cognitively impaired to participate in interviews, researchers may depend on proxy informants. Thus, differences introduced by rater role may threaten the validity or interpretation of quality of care measurement (Tennstedt, Skinner, Sullivan, and McKinlay 1992   ). Related Work on Rater Perspectives Incongruence between professional and lay perspectives of service needs and preferences is well-documented (Avant and Dressel 1980   ; Keith 1975   ; Riesenfield, Newcomer, Berlant, and Dempsey 1972   ; Wilson and Netting 1987   ). For example, Wilson and Netting 1987    found that elders identified fewer problems and needs than health professionals did, whereas professionals perceived that the elderly adults had more access to services (transportation, specifically) than did the elderly adults themselves. Epstein and colleagues 1989    reported low correlations between patient and proxy ratings of satisfaction with health care. Factors associated with satisfaction with hospital discharge plans are different for patient and family raters (Proctor, Morrow-Howell, Albaz, and Weir 1992   ). Patient ratings were associated with involvement in the decision-making process, social support, and physical condition; family ratings were associated with length of hospital stay, discharge planning processes, and discharge destination. Efforts to improve satisfaction ratings may be different depending on which consumer group is being considered.The study of systematic differences between various raters of health status has a somewhat longer history. Moderate to weak associations have been documented between self-rated health and physician-rated health, with older adults generally rating their health more positively than physicians do (Friedsam and Martin 1963   ; Kivinen, Halonen, Eronen, and Nissinen 1998   ; Rothman, Hedrick, Bulcroft, Hickam, and Rubenstein 1991   ; Streib, Suchman, and Phillips 1958   ; Maddox 1964   ). Additionally, self-rated health has been found to be a better predictor of future health-related outcomes (Maddox and Douglas 1973   ) and health service use (Markides 1979   ).Similarly, systematic differences are observed in various raters' assessments of elders' functional ability (Rubenstein, Schairer, Wieland, and Kane 1984   ; Dodge, Janz, and Clark 1994   ). As with health status, older adults tend to report higher levels of functioning, with family members reporting the lowest levels, and professionals (nurses) assigning intermediate ratings (Rubenstein et al. 1984   ). Further, the closer the relationship and the more frequent the contact, the lower the family members' perception of the elder's functional and health status is (Rubenstein et al. 1984   ; Rothman et al. 1991   ).Several researchers have tested explanations for differences between ratings of health and function. Kivinen and colleagues 1998    postulated that it is the differential perception of the effect of age that explains the difference in rating of health status between patients and physicians. After controlling for medical condition, they found that age of the patient did not relate to self-rated health whereas it did relate to assessments by physician, with older patients assessed as being in poorer health. Other researchers have suggested that characteristics of the elders as well as the family proxies affect ratings of the elder's health and functional status (Kiyak, Teri, and Borson 1994   ; Magaziner, Simonsick, Kashner, et al. 1988   ; Rothman, Hedrick, Bulcroft, Hickam, and Rubenstein 1991   ; Poulshock and Deimling 1984   ; Hooyman, Gonyea, and Montgomery 1985   ). Better agreement between patient and family raters has been associated with better mental health and cognitive ability of the patients (Magaziner et al. 1988   ; Kiyak, Teri, and Borson 1994   ). Family proxies experiencing greater burden or psychological distress report greater impairment in health and functional ability of the care recipient. This suggests that family members perceive higher disability to correspond with burden they feel or to justify nursing home placement or formal service use they may feel they need (Rothman et al. 1991   ). Finally, it has been suggested that the disabled elder may seek to conceal disability so as not to burden caregivers, deny disability as a coping mechanisms, or use a different time frame in the evaluation of their ability (Rubenstein et al. 1984   ). Study Focus and Conceptualization This study addressed the issue of stakeholder perspectives on the quality of in-home supportive care. Quality is conceptualized and measured in terms of the sufficiency of the amount of care received to meet specific functional dependency needs. Who says how much is enough help with activities of daily living—the care recipient, the informal or formal care provider, the professional care manager, or the public payer? In this study, we focused on the care-recipient perspective versus the professional perspective of a nurse researcher. Both formal and informal care are considered when assessing sufficiency of care, which is very important in the context of community care (Capitman et al. 1997   ).This study addressed four research questions:Do care recipients and professionals vary in their assessment of physical functioning ability, and if so, what specific functional areas (ADL and instrumental activities of daily living [IADL] areas) contribute to the variation?Do care recipients and professionals vary in their assessment of the sufficiency of care? That is, do care recipients and professionals have different perspectives on whether enough help is provided?What specific functional need areas (ADL and IADL areas) contribute to the variation in raters' assessment of sufficiency of care?What factors are associated with sufficiency of care from these two different perspectives?Although previous literature consistently demonstrates that older adults rate their functional ability higher than either family members or health care professionals do, we sought to replicate this finding in a sample of chronically ill elders recently discharged home from the hospital. The last three questions have the potential to add new knowledge regarding rater role. Methods Parent Study The data for this study were derived from a larger, prospective study of postacute care for older adults with chronic heart disease. To accomplish the aims of the parent study, the researchers recruited 253 older adults between June, 1990, and October, 1991, while the participants were hospitalized at a large Midwestern urban teaching hospital. Subjects met the following criteria: they were 65 years of age or older, were diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF), were served by a discharge planner, and were discharged to a home setting. CHF is a particularly appropriate diagnosis for studying postacute home care, given its prevalence among elderly persons, high public health costs, and the importance of supportive home care to maintain gains achieved during hospitalization (Bonneux, Baredregt, Meeter, Bonsel, and van der Mass 1994   ). Given the aims of the parent study, we selected patients served by discharge planners to ensure a sample with need for home care and one that received a mix of informal and formal services.Discharge planners identified patients who met study criteria, whom research assistants approached to explain the study; 82% of patients contacted consented to participate. We approached a family member at the instruction of the discharge planner when patients were too ill or cognitively impaired to participate. In 35% of the cases, this family collateral provided consent and completed data collection for purposes of the larger study. Data Collection At the time of hospital discharge, a research assistant abstracted the medical records. At 2 weeks postdischarge, a research assistant completed a telephone survey with the study participant or the collateral. Within 48 hours of this telephone interview, a registered nurse (RN) research assistant completed an in-home interview. Both the telephone and in-home interview focused on functional ability and informal and formal assistance received to meet the patient's ADL and IADL needs. We recognize that two data collection methods are used (telephone and in-home interviews) and that this may confound our findings in that differences attributed to rater role may result from differing data collection methods. Yet the advantages of this approach outweigh this risk, as we describe below.During the telephone interview, the research assistant relied on the study participant's self-report. We viewed the telephone interview as the preferred approach to data collection in self-report data because, compared with an in-person interview, it minimizes cues and the influence of the interviewer. In contrast, we viewed the in-person interview as conducive to obtaining a professional clinical assessment. During the in-home interview, the nurse research assistant had access to a broader range of information she could draw from the study participant, the family members present at the interview, and clinical observations to make a professional assessment of functional ability and sufficiency of care provided. Thus, we obtained concurrent assessment of physical functioning ability and the sufficiency of care through the telephone interview (self-report from the study participant) and the in-home interview (clinical report of nurse research assistant). Sample Subset Addressing the research questions posed in this article required that (a) the care recipient be capable of providing self-report and (b) each subject provide both a telephone interview and concurrent in-home interview. Although the requisite sample for these analyses is select and, in our case, small (n = 85), such a sample is necessary to answer questions about rater perspectives that are important both substantively and methodologically. Despite limits to statistical power, the subsetted sample provides a scarce opportunity to examine issues in quality of care measurement that are critical in both gerontology and health services research.Accordingly, we subset the sample from the larger study as follows. Of the 253 eligible patients at the time of discharge, 209 were available to participate in a telephone survey 2 weeks post discharge. In this 2-week period, 39 patients died, were readmitted to the hospital, or entered a nursing home before information could be gathered; this number reflects the unstable condition of CHF and the high readmission and mortality rate associated with this condition (Bonneux et al. 1994   ). Five patients refused to participate in the 2-week interview. Of the 209 study participants completing the 2-week postdischarge telephone interview, in-home interviews were completed on 149. In-home interviews were not completed for two reasons: (a) the participant lived more than 2 hours from the study site and in-home interviews were not requested because of the excessive travel time and (b) the participant consented to the telephone interview but not to the in-home assessment. Thus, 149 observations had concurrent telephone and in-home interviews at the 2-week postdischarge observation point. Finally, to compare care recipients with professionals, we include only those 85 observations for which the older adult completed the telephone interview rather than a family proxy.Bivariate analyses were completed to compare the 85 elders in this study sample with the 124 elders who were available for the 2-week follow-up interview but were not included in this particular analysis (as mentioned above, 209 study participants completed the first follow-up interview). There are no gender, race, or socioeconomic status (SES) differences between the two groups; however, the 85 elders in this study were more functional (t = 9.39, p < .01) and younger (t = −3.79, p < .01) than elders who did not participate. This difference results from the elimination of study participants whose family proxies provided the information because the elder was not able, most often by virtue of illness or dependency. This sample bias limits generalizability, which is discussed below.As noted above, achieving a valid subsample to address differences in rater perspective is associated with limits to both analytic power and generalizability. In the functional area-by-area analysis reported below, four cell sizes were too small for valid tests of statistical difference (transfer, toileting, walking, and eating). Thus we eliminated these areas from the comparison of self-report and professional assessment. In regard to generalizability, those care recipients too ill or too cognitively impaired to participate in the telephone interview are different from those who can participate, and indeed the amount of care they receive and their perceptions of the sufficiency of this care could be different. Thus we can generalize only to care recipients who can participate in telephone interviews regarding their conditions and their care arrangements. This generalizability issue would plague any such study no matter how big the sample size because one can never measure and compare self-report perspective from study participants incapable of self-report. Dependent Variables The two dependent variables in this study, physical functioning ability and sufficiency of care, were obtained from both the care-recipient and the professional perspectives. For the care-recipient perspective, research assistants (Masters in social work students) conducted telephone interviews with each care recipient, capturing the dependent variables through self-report. To obtain a professional perspective, we trained geriatric nurse practitioners to conduct the in-home assessments using all relevant information available in the interview as well as observation to inform their ratings of functional ability and sufficiency of care. To increase reliability, we used only two nurses for the study. Both nurses had RN degrees and were active and experienced geriatric practitioners.Physical functioning ability was assessed using the OARS (Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assesssment Questionnaire) instrument (Duke University Center for Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ), which has seven ADLs (transfer, walking, toileting, bathing, grooming, dressing, and eating), and six IADLs (meal preparation, shopping, money management, travel, housekeeping, and medicine administration). In each area, functional ability is captured with a three-level response: able to perform activity with no help (2), able to perform with some help (1), or completely unable to perform (0). The summative measure ranges from 0 to 26, with higher scores reflecting greater functional ability. Telephone interviews captured the care recipients' self-report of functional ability, whereas the nurses assessed functional ability through clinical interviewing during the in-home interview.Sufficiency of care reflects the extent to which the informal and formal assistance is seen as enough to meet subjects' ADL and IADL needs. The measurement tool used to capture the sufficiency of care was developed by the authors for studying posthospital care; reliability was established through tests on 20 subjects (Morrow-Howell, Proctor, and Dore 1998   ). Test–retest reliability, established on subject telephone self-report on two consecutive days, was .87, using a weighted kappa. Interrater reliability of the instrument across two professionals, who conducted simultaneous in-home assessments, was .81, again using a weighted kappa (Morrow-Howell, Proctor, and Dore 1998   ).Procedures for scoring sufficiency of care were as follows. In areas of the OARS instrument in which function in an ADL or IADL area was rated as independent, we asked no further questions about that specific function. In ADL or IADL areas with any dependency, further information was captured about who provided assistance with the task, how often assistance was received from formal and informal sources, and how sufficient this help was. "Sufficiency of care" was rated, specific to each area of functional need, using a 4-point scale on which 1 = without help at most times; 2 = usually does not have enough help; 3 = usually has enough, but on occasion help is not available when needed; and 4 = always has enough help. As with the functional-ability ratings, care-recipient ratings of sufficiency were self-reports obtained during the telephone interviews; professional ratings of sufficiency of care were nurse assessments from the in-home interviews.To compare care recipient and professional ratings, we calculated two summative scores, averaging the rated sufficiency of care across areas of functional dependence—one score reflecting the care recipient's overall sufficiency of care and one reflecting the professional (nurse) assessment of the overall sufficiency of care. The quantity ratings (1–4) in each area of need were summed and divided by the number of identified dependency areas, producing an average sufficiency rating. These scores were therefore able to control for difference in care-recipient and professional perspective in functional ability, as follows. If a care recipient reported functional dependency in three areas (transportation, meal preparation, and housekeeping, for example), the three sufficiency ratings in each need area were summed and divided by three. If, however, the nurse assessed more areas of dependency (for example, four areas, including transportation, meal preparation, housekeeping, and medicine administration), her score would be an average of four sufficiency ratings. Each summative sufficiency rating—one for care recipient and one for professional—ranged from 1 (never enough help) to 4 (always enough help). Scores were thus comparable across rater, regardless of differences between the raters in assessing the patient's functional ability. Independent Variables A variety of independent variables were measured for purposes of exploring their contribution to the dependent variable sufficiency of care from care recipient and professional perspectives. Demographic characteristics were extracted from the medical record and included age in years, gender, and race recorded dichotomously as White and African American. Marital status was recorded as currently married and not currently married. Socioeconomic status was assessed from patient response to questions for the Hollingshead Index of Social Class; this measure uses education and occupation to assign subjects a rating of 11 to 77, with lower numbers representing higher social status (Hollingshead 1957   ).The care recipient's health characteristics were ascertained by the nurse during the in-home assessment. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Short Blessed Mental Status exam, which yields a score of 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating more cognitive impairment (Blessed et al. 1968   ). The Chronic Conditions Checklist from the OARS instrument (Fillenbaum 1988   ) captured the existence of 32 chronic medical conditions, weighted by the extent to which the condition interferes with activity (from 0 [no limitation] to 3 [severe limitation]).The informal care situation was captured through four variables obtained as part of the in-home interview. The identity of primary caregiver was recorded as spouse, adult child, or other. If other caregivers assisted in any way, a dichotomous variable captured the involvement of secondary caregiver. Co-residence of the caregiver and care recipient was also recorded dichotomously. The study participant provided information about the health of primary caregiver, using a 4-point rating scale of excellent to poor. During the in-home interview, the nurse also queried about the level of formal care. Formal care was measured through the number of hours of in-home care provided by agency staff, volunteers, or any paid helper during the previous month. Statistical Analysis The univariate distributions of the independent and dependent variables were examined and descriptive statistics are presented in  Table 1  . The extreme skew on the number of hours of formal assistance per month warranted attention. This variable was log transformed, resulting in a more symmetric distribution, and the logged variable was used in regression analysis. Dependent t tests were used to compare care recipient and professional ratings on functional ability and sufficiency of care. Similarly, we used dependent t tests to compare the functional ability ratings and the sufficiency of care ratings on each ADL and IADL area to determine the sources of variation in the summative scores. Thus, functional ratings as well as sufficiency ratings were compared between care recipients and professionals in bathing, grooming, toileting, and so forth. In cases in which sufficiency ratings were compared within each ADL and IADL area, we compared care recipients to professionals only when both raters assessed a functional dependency in the area and therefore provided a sufficiency of care rating in that area (i.e., sufficiency ratings in the area of bathing could only be compared if both care recipient and professional reported a dependency in that area and therefore provided a sufficiency of care rating in bathing). Although this strategy results in the loss of sample size within each cell, it enables the comparison of sufficiency ratings that are freed from the rater bias that is known to exist in the assessment of functional ability.We used analysis of variance techniques through the SAS general linear model procedure to test the relationship of the independent variables to the sufficiency of care measures (Cody and Smith 1997   ). Main effect and repeated measure models were both used. We used repeated measures analysis of variance to test the interactions of the independent variables and rater identify on sufficiency of care. Given the number of interactions to be tested, we tested each interaction separately, after controlling for all independent variables and rater role. The caregiver identity variable was dummy coded. Because of the substantial correlation between spousal caregiver and marital status in this sample (r = .71) as well as the lack of a statistically significant association with the sufficiency of care ratings, we eliminated caregiver identity from the regressions to reduce the number of independent variables being tested. The only model with a significant interaction term is presented. Results Do Care Recipients and Professionals Vary in Their Assessment of Physical Functioning Ability? If so, What Specific Functional Areas Are the Sources of the Variation? As would be predicted from previous work, the older adults receiving in-home supportive care rated their functional ability higher than nurse researcher assistants did, t(84) = −5.57, p = .0001. As seen in  Table 1  , care recipients rated their functional status approximately 2 points higher on the 26-point scale of physical functioning (19.32 vs. 17.51). Ratings from each of the ADL and IADL areas are compared in  Table 2  . For each functional area, in which scores range from 0 to 2, the mean care recipient rating was compared with the mean professional rating. As can be seen, care recipients rated their functioning higher in all but three ADL and IADL areas. Nurses rated the older adults as more functional in the activity of bathing than did the care recipients themselves. In two areas—meal preparation and housekeeping—professional and care-recipient ratings of functional ability were not significantly different. Do Care Recipients and Professionals Vary in Their Assessment of the Sufficiency of Care? As seen in  Table 1  , professionals tended to rate the amount of care as less sufficient than the care recipients did (2.73 vs. 3.21); (t(84) = −4.9, p = .0001). On average, the nurses were almost one half a point lower on the 4-point scale. What Specific Functional Need Areas Contribute to the Variation in Raters' Assessment of Sufficiency of Care? Ratings in each of nine ADL and IADL areas are compared in  Table 3  . Four functional areas (transfer, toileting, walking, and eating) were eliminated because the number of pairs of ratings was less than five. For each functional area in which both the care recipient and nurse agreed that there was a dependency, the mean care recipient rating of sufficiency of care was compared with the mean professional rating. As can be seen, the sufficiency ratings did not vary in three functional need areas. However, it should be noted that sample size drops quite low in two of these comparisons, and lack of statistical power could explain the null finding. Care recipients rated the sufficiency of care higher in five need areas (note that the marginally significant difference in medications is included, given a p value of .06 and a small sample size). Nurses rated assistance in the area of transportation as more sufficient than did care recipients. What Factors Are Associated With Sufficiency of Care From the Two Different Perspectives? Analysis of variance reveals that three variables have main effects on sufficiency of care: coresidence of care recipient and care receiver, health of caregiver, and rater identity (see  Table 4  ). Two of these variables relate to the informal care system. Care was rated as more sufficient when care recipients lived with their caregivers and when caregivers were healthier. As reflected in earlier analyses, identity of the rater is related to sufficiency of care, with professional ratings being lower than care-recipient ratings. When the two informal support variables were tested in interactions with rater identity, the interaction effects were not significant. Thus, these variables are related to the sufficiency ratings, regardless of whether the rater was a care recipient or a professional. Of the 11 interaction terms tested, only 1 interaction was significantly associated with sufficiency of care. We found no main effect for amount of formal services and no relationship between formal services and sufficiency of care from the perspective of care recipients. However, for professionals, higher amounts of formal care were associated with lower sufficiency ratings. Discussion We acknowledge both weaknesses and strengths in our conceptualization and measurement of the dependent variable, sufficiency of in-home care. The construct, sufficiency of care to meet elders' functional dependency needs, is but one aspect of the broader construct of quality of care. Our focus on the amount or quantity of care does not capture the important aspect of quality, or how good that care is. Yet quantity seems to be a minimal component of quality; how can care be construed as "quality" when there isn't enough care?Consistent with a few other examples in the quality of care literature (e.g., Skinner et al. 1999   ), we chose to measure our dependent variable, sufficiency of care, within specific areas of functional needs, with two important consequences. First, our data can reveal variations in sufficiency of care across the various ADL and IADL areas for which care is needed and provided. Findings thus have the potential to pinpoint specific areas of challenge or difficulty in providing enough care, as well as highlight areas of care for which the care provider and care recipient have different perspectives. Second, the resultant aggregate ratings of sufficiency should be more reliable than global ratings that are not tied to specifics.This study's findings replicate and build on prior work demonstrating that older adults rate their functional abilities higher than professionals. The study adds new knowledge regarding differences in perspectives by documenting that the assessments of sufficiency of care also vary by rater role. In general, care recipients rate amount of care as more sufficient compared with how professionals rate it. These findings are very consistent with related work that suggests older adults rate their functional ability and health higher than professionals do, as well as identify fewer problems and needs.These data suggest that variance between nurse ratings and care recipient ratings of physical function derives from both ADL and IADL areas. In 10 out of 13 activities, care recipients rated their functional ability higher than nurses did. The nurses rated functional ability higher in only one area—bathing. Perhaps dependent elders are more conservative about their abilities in the area of bathing out of fear of falling in the bathroom.When considering the source of variance from ADL and IADL areas in the sufficiency ratings, the pattern is less clear than in functional assessments. Care recipients rate their care as more sufficient in five out of nine need areas, with no statistical difference between the two ratings in three areas. In regard to transportation, nurses assessed the amount of help to be more sufficient. It may be that nurses view the amount of transportation as sufficient if it is enough to get the care recipient to necessary destinations, like medical appointments. The care recipient may view other trips as important as well, such as those for social visits or pleasure outings; the care recipient may assess help as less than enough if these trips are not occurring, whereas the nurse may view these types of trips as more discretionary.Although this study does contribute to understanding how raters' assessment of care varies, we did not capture information about why ratings are different. It is likely that care recipients are motivated to report sufficient levels of assistance for two reasons. First, as Donabedian noted, "unless special precautions are taken, patients may be reluctant to reveal their opinions for fear of alienating their medical attendants" (1988, p. 1746). Particularly with elderly adults, Woodruff and Applebaum 1996    suggested that consumers' perspectives may be influenced by their strong desire to remain independent and in their current living situations. Care recipients may lower their own standard of acceptability in regard to meal preparation, bathing, housekeeping, and so forth when faced with the reality of their needs and their available resources. Second, care recipients may not be willing to criticize their care providers, especially family members, by assigning low sufficiency ratings. On the other hand, professionals may maintain their standards of acceptable quantity of care across care recipients, with less threat (certainly less personal repercussions) about the consequences of the deficiencies. Additionally, they could be less concerned about judging care providers as deficient in some way. Our findings point to the need for further research on motivations leading to differences in ratings between different stakeholders in home care.There are some similarities in factors associated with sufficiency ratings between the two perspectives. Two variables are important predictors from both perspectives: coresidence of caregiver and care recipient, and health of the caregiver. These two variables had main effects but no interaction effects in the regression analyses, reflecting the salience of these independent variables for both care recipient and professional. Remarkably, only characteristics of the informal caregiving network were related to the sufficiency of care ratings irrespective of rater. These findings speak to the critical role of informal caregivers in the community long-term care system. The proximity and the health of the primary helper affect the perceived sufficiency of the amount of assistance received. These findings suggest that if we are to increase the quality of in-home supportive care, we should focus on programs and policies that shore up the informal system.In addition to caregiver proximity and caregiver health, one other independent variable affected professionals' ratings of the sufficiency of care: amount of formal service. (In this sample of chronically ill elders in the post-acute period, there are comparatively high levels of formal service, which was planned as part of the parent study.) Interestingly, nurses rated care as less sufficient in situations with higher levels of formal care. Although counterintuitive, this finding is not infrequent in services research and often indicates limitations in measurement—specifically the inability to adequately capture and control for sickness or need level. That is, sicker or more dependent elders usually receive more formal care, yet despite higher levels of care, their care arrangements remain less adequate because of the high demands of the care situation. In this particular study, we might interpret this association to mean that, in the professional assessment, the addition of formal services does not bring the amount of care up to a sufficient level (or in the few cases in which there are only formal services involved, formal services alone are not enough). These interpretations are consistent with our finding that caregiver proximity is a critical factor; often, formal providers are not as accessible or proximate as informal providers. In short, these findings suggest that a focus on formal care at expense of informal care is not sufficient to improve the quality of in-home supportive care.Ratings of the sufficiency of care did not vary significantly by elder age, gender, race, or SES, whether from the perspective of care recipient or of the professional. This failure to find disparities in the sufficiency of care for various demographic groups, including those at risk for poorer health outcomes, may be reassuring from a social justice perspective.Important implications from this study are that raters of sufficiency of in-home supportive care are not interchangeable, and that information source is a critical factor in quality of care studies. Both care recipient and professional ratings are valid because sufficiency perspectives may be based on different standards and different values—but they are not interchangeable. Program evaluators and researchers need to determine which perspective is most appropriate for the situation under study. Professional ratings may be more related to medical outcomes, such as readmission or morbidity, whereas care recipient ratings may be more related to quality of life or satisfaction measures. Program developers and funders also need to pay close attention to the source of information in needs assessments. As Rosow 1964    stated many years ago, problems of old age can be divided into two groups: those that they actually have or think they have and those the professionals think they have. More recently, Lenert, Ziegler, Lee, Sommi, and Mahmoud 2000    pointed out that substituting providers' views for those of patients might lead to overtreatment of patients. In sum, these findings confirm that rater perspective is likely to have consequences for health service planning, delivery, and evaluations, and that various stakeholders define quality differently, which translates into different expectations of the health care system and thus differing evaluations of quality (McGlynn 1997   ).Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study examined commonalities and differences in the experiences and challenges of White, Black, and Hispanic informal caregivers in New York, NY. Design and Methods: A randomly selected representative cross-section of 2,241 households was contacted through telephone interviews. Complete data were available for 380 eligible participants, who were classified as White (n = 164), Black (n = 129) and Hispanic (n = 87). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences in caregiving intensity, reported difficulty with providing care, and having unmet needs with care provision. Results: Over 70% of caregivers had no help from formal caregivers, even though over 80% had been providing care for at least 1 year, and 40% had been providing this care for 20 or more hr per week. Compared with White caregivers, Black caregivers were more likely to provide higher intensity care, to report having unmet needs with care provision, and to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers, but were less likely to report difficulty with providing care. Hispanic caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to have help from formal caregivers and to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers. Implications: Although many similarities exist in the experiences and challenges of informal caregivers, gaining insight from different populations of family caregivers would help program planners, policy makers, and formal caregivers to develop and implement culturally sensitive programs and policies that are supportive of the needs of these caregivers in their ever-expanding roles. Future efforts also should focus on exploring the potentially significant role that community resources, in particular, religious institutions, could play in providing outreach and support to racial/ethnic minority caregivers.   Ethnicity ,  Race ,  Home care ,  Informal care ,  Religiosity Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDAccording to census estimates, over the next 2 decades, the fastest growing sector of the population will be elderly adults (U.S. Census Bureau 1996b   , U.S. Census Bureau 2001   ; Social Security Administration 2000   ). This phenomenon is expected to be observed across all races, including the nation's largest racial/ethnic minority groups, Blacks and Hispanics (U.S. Census Bureau 2001   ). Although population growth varies across states, current demographic trends in New York State appear to concur with national estimates (U.S. Census Bureau 2001   ). Of the nearly 19 million residents in New York, 13% are 65 years of age or older, 16% are Black, and 15% are of Hispanic ethnicity. The largest proportion of New Yorkers live in New York City, accounting for 42% of all New York residents. New York City also is home to the largest majority of New Yorkers who are 65 years of age or older (38%) and of Black (71%) and Hispanic (75%) racial/ethnic descent (U.S. Census Bureau 2001   ).With an aging population, the need for dependent care is likely to increase. As current service-use patterns reveal, informal caregivers (i.e., unpaid family members and friends) bear the overwhelming responsibility for the provision of home care and long-term care services. In light of limited access, availability, and affordability of formal (i.e., paid professional or paraprofessionals) care, informal caregivers will likely continue, or expand, their role as primary caretakers well into the 21st century.Although past studies have documented the vital role of informal caregivers in care provision, relatively little is known about the experiences and challenges of racial/ethnic minority caregivers (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, and Cooper 1999   ). In general, the literature has treated caregivers as a homogenous group, without systematically examining racial/ethnic differences in the caregiving experience. Among the few studies that have compared caregivers of different racial/ethnic backgrounds, the focus primarily has been on documenting the sociodemographic differences between caregivers (Hinrichsen and Ramirez 1992   ; Wykle and Segal 1991   ), the kinship between caregivers and care recipients (Penrod, Kane, Kane, and Finch 1995   ; Tennstedt, McKinlay, and Sullivan 1989   ), the amount and type of assistance provided by caregivers (Haley, West, Wadley, et al. 1995   ; Knight, Merril, McCallum, and Fox 2000   ; National Alliance for Caregiving and American Association for Retired Persons 1997   ; Navaie-Waliser, Feldman, Gould, et al. in press   ), and the impact of caregiving on the caregiver's emotional and mental state (Knight et al. 2000   ; Mui 1992   ; Farran, Miller, Kaufman, and Davis 1997   ). A review of these studies reveals significant differences between ethnic minority caregivers and White caregivers. Compared with White caregivers, ethnic minority caregivers tend to be younger, less likely to be married, and have lower income (Knight et al. 2000   ; Nkongho and Archbold 1995   , Nkongho and Archbold 1996   ); are more likely to provide a greater volume of informal care (Mui 1992   ; Fredman, Daly and Lazur 1995   ); are less likely to be depressed (Connel and Gibson 1997   ; Miller and Snigdha 1999   ; Farran et al. 1997   ), stressed (Connel and Gibson 1997   ; Miller and Snigdha 1999   ) or feel burdened (Haley et al. 1995   ; Haley, Roth, Coleton, et al. 1996   ; Knight et al. 2000   ; Lawton, Rajagopal, Brody, and Kleban 1992   ); and are more likely to have unmet needs associated with care provision (Hinrichsen and Ramirez 1992   ; Wykle and Segal 1991   ).The few comparative studies in the literature provide insightful details about the experiences of informal caregivers; however, they have methodological and content limitations that preclude the generalizability of their findings. With regard to methodology, past studies generally have been conducted on relatively small, nonrepresentative, convenience samples of caregivers (Connel and Gibson 1997   ; Dilworth-Anderson et al. 1999   ; Farran et al. 1997   ; Haley et al. 1995   , Haley et al. 1996   ). Furthermore, these studies primarily have focused on comparisons between White and Black caregivers (Connel and Gibson 1997   ; Farran et al. 1997   ; Fredman et al. 1995   ; Haley et al. 1995   , Haley et al. 1996   ; Hinrichsen and Ramirez 1992   ; Lawton et al. 1992   ), adding to the difficulties in generalizing to other predominant ethnic groups such as Hispanics. Moreover, none of these studies has focused on ethnic minority caregivers residing in an urban environment, even though this is where most racial/ethnic minorities in the nation live (U.S. Census Bureau 2001   ). Lastly, with regard to content limitations, past studies provide a relatively narrow view of caregivers' experiences among racial/ethnic minorities.The purpose of the present study was to extend past research on caregivers by comparing representative samples of White, Black, and Hispanic informal caregivers in a large metropolitan setting to examine commonalties and differences in their experiences and challenges as caregivers. Specifically, it was hypothesized that racial/ethnic minority caregivers would be more likely to provide higher intensity care, report caregiver difficulty with providing care, and have unmet needs with care provision. Methods Study Design and Sample This study was undertaken as part of a broader study of family caregivers in New York City (Levine, Kuerbis, Gould, et al. 2000   ). An equal probability for selection method sampling technique was used to perform random digit dialing. Through this process, a total of 8,329 randomly selected telephone numbers in New York City were identified, 3,338 of which were not registered to households (e.g., business telephones, cell phones, fax numbers). Of the remaining 4,991 households with telephones, 2,241 were successfully contacted between May 1998 and September 1998 to identify individuals with caregiving experience. Eligibility for study inclusion was restricted to persons 18 years of age or older who were directly providing unpaid care or arranging for paid care to a relative or friend for anytime during the 12 months preceding the study. A randomly selected respondent within each household completed a structured, pretested survey questionnaire. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish and were, on average, 24 min in duration.By applying the American Association for Public Opinion Research's response and eligible participant cooperation rate calculations ( http://www.aapor.org/ethics/stddef.html , pp. 18–20; RR4 formula), a 60% participant response rate (proportion of participants of unknown eligibility who agreed to be screened) was calculated using an overall screen-in (eligibility) "incidence" rate of 17% and "accuracy of sample" rate of 50% (i.e., the proportion of telephone numbers never reached that could have been households with or without caregivers). In addition, an overall caregiver cooperation rate (proportion of caregivers interviewed from all eligible caregivers ever contacted) of 84% was obtained. After initial screening, 402 individuals who met the eligibility criteria agreed to participate in the study. Complete data were available for 397 (99%) caregivers, who were stratified into the following groups: White, non-Hispanic (n = 164), Black, non-Hispanic (n = 129), Hispanic (n = 87), and other (n = 17). For analytic purposes, individuals from "other" racial/ethnic backgrounds were excluded from this study. Data Collection Data were collected by trained interviewers from the National Opinion Research Center, a survey research firm housed in Chicago, IL. All interviewers completed training on the content of the survey instrument, response skip patterns and coding procedures, telephone-interviewing techniques, and participant-recruitment strategies. The following information was obtained by telephone interviews with informal caregivers: (a) sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, employment status); (b) caregiver's and care recipient's health status (e.g., presence of a serious illness, general health status measured using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent); (c) hospitalization of care recipient in the year preceding the study (yes/no); (d) caregiver–care-recipient's relationship (e.g., primary or secondary caregiver, living arrangements, affiliation); (e) use of any formal (i.e., paid professionals or nonprofessionals) care by the care recipient (yes/no); (f) type of care provided specific to activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, feeding, managing incontinence, getting in or out of bed (transferring), and ambulating; instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as shopping, housework, preparing meals, transportation, making telephone calls, managing finances, and arranging access to government-sponsored programs; performing dressing changes; providing assistance with use of medical equipment; and assisting with or administering prescription medications; (g) hours of care provided per week; (h) duration of care; (i) reported difficulty with providing care (measured using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from very difficult to not at all difficult); and (j) having unmet needs with care provision at any time during the year preceding the study (yes/no).The Level of Care Index (National Alliance for Caregiving and American Association for Retired Persons 1997   ) was used to determine caregiving intensity. This index combines the number of ADLs and IADLs performed by the caregiver with the hours of care provided weekly to generate a composite score based on a 5-point scale on which 1 represents least intensive and 5 represents most intensive. Statistical Analysis SPSS (SPSS, Inc 1999   ) was used to perform descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, means, standard deviations), bivariate analyses (e.g., Mantel Haenszel chi-square test), and multivariate modeling. Using logistic regression, we used three models, each controlling for the effects of the caregiver's age (continuous) and employment status (1 = employed part-time or full-time, 0 = unemployed) and the care recipient's health status (1 = fair/poor, 0 = good/excellent). The first model examined caregiving intensity (dichotomized as 1 = higher intensity for scores 4 and 5 or 0 = lower intensity for scores 1, 2, and 3), as a function of the caregiver's race (indicator variables were used to compare Black and Hispanic caregivers with White caregivers as the reference group), being a primary caregiver (1 = yes, 0 = no), duration of care (1 = 1 or more years, 0 = less than 1 year), reported difficulty with providing care (1 = somewhat/very difficult, 0 = not at all/not very difficult), having unmet needs with care provision (1 = yes, 0 = no), receiving help from formal caregivers (1 = yes, 0 = no), and experiencing increased religiosity since becoming a caregiver (1 = strongly agree/agree, 0 = disagree/strongly disagree). The second model examined reported difficulty with care provision as a function of the caregiver's race, being a primary caregiver, duration of care, having unmet needs with care provision, caregiving intensity, receiving help from formal caregivers, and experiencing increased religiosity. The third model examined the probability of having unmet needs with care provision as a function of the caregiver's race, being a primary caregiver, duration of care, reported difficulty with care provision, caregiving intensity, receiving help from formal caregivers, and experiencing increased religiosity. Interaction effects between independent variables were assessed in the models and none was statistically significant. Therefore, only the main effects model is presented. Crude (unadjusted) and adjusted odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were computed. All of the analyses were weight adjusted to represent the general population of New York City (Bishop, Fienberg, and Holland 1975   ; Deming and Stephan 1940   ; Fienberg 1980   ). Poststratification weight adjustments ranged from 0.05 to 6.5 and were derived using age (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65 and older), sex (male, female), and race (White, Black, other) as the three respondent characteristics (Bishop et al. 1975   ). Marginal distributions were estimated using 1996 Population Estimates generated by the Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau 1996a   ). Results Sociodemographic and Health Characteristics of Informal Caregivers As shown in  Table 1  , White, Black, and Hispanic caregivers differed little in their sociodemographic and health characteristics. Age and employment status were the only two characteristics that were significantly different across the three groups of caregivers. Compared with White caregivers, a significantly greater proportion of Black and Hispanic caregivers were younger than 50 years old (p < .01). The average caregiver age was 50 (SD = 16) for Whites, 41 (SD = 13) for Blacks, and 37 (SD = 15) for Hispanics. In addition, a significantly greater proportion of Black caregivers were employed as compared with White or Hispanic caregivers (p < .01). Care Recipient's Characteristics and Relationship with Caregiver  Table 2  describes the general characteristics of care recipients and the caregiver–care-recipient's relationship. Compared with the care recipients of White caregivers, care recipients of Black and Hispanic caregivers were more likely to be 50 to 64 years old (p < .01). In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of care recipients of White caregivers were 65 years of age or older as compared with the care recipients of Black and Hispanic caregivers (p < .01). The average age of care recipients was 71 years (SD = 20) for White caregivers and 65 years (SD = 20) for both Black and Hispanic caregivers. The care recipients did not differ in having a serious health problem or having been hospitalized in the past year.In examining the caregiver–care-recipient's relationship, the results revealed that the majority of the caregivers were primary caregivers and most were family members of the care recipient. Approximately one third of care recipients lived with their caregivers and another one third lived alone. Caregiver Activities As described in  Table 3  , there were few observed differences between the three groups of caregivers in the duration and frequency with which they provided care and in the frequency with which they received help from formal caregivers. That is, over 70% of caregivers had no help from formal caregivers, even though over 80% had been providing care for at least 1 year, and 40% had been providing this care for 20 or more hr per week.The most common caregiving activity focused on IADLs, and its provision did not differ across racial/ethnic groups. However, significant differences were observed in the provision of ADLs, with Black and Hispanic caregivers providing more care with certain ADLs such as dressing (p < .01), feeding (p < .01), and transferring (p < .01), as compared with White caregivers. Moreover, Black caregivers were significantly more likely than White or Hispanic caregivers to be providing higher intensity care (p < .01). Caregiver Challenges Crude (unadjusted) comparisons of the challenges faced by caregivers are provided in  Table 4  . No differences were found across the three groups of informal caregivers in the duration of care or the hours of care provided per week. However, compared with White caregivers, Black caregivers were significantly less likely to be primary caregivers (p < .05) and to report difficulty with providing care (p < .05) but more likely to report having unmet needs with care provision (p < .01) and to experience increased religiosity since becoming a caregiver (p < .01). Similarly, Hispanic caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to report having unmet needs with care provision, to receive help from formal caregivers, and to experience increased religiosity since becoming a caregiver. Multivariate Findings As shown in  Table 5  , after adjusting for potential confounders, the results revealed several common trends across all three groups of caregivers. The provision of higher intensity care was significantly associated with being a primary caregiver (p < .01). In addition, compared with caregivers who provided care for less than 1 year, caregivers who provided care for 1 or more years were less likely to report difficulty with providing care (p < .01) but more likely to report having unmet needs with care provision (p < .01). Moreover, reported difficulty with care provision was significantly associated with higher caregiving intensity (p < .01) and reports of having unmet needs with care provision (p < .01). Furthermore, caregivers who received help from formal caregivers were more likely than were caregivers who did not receive help from formal caregivers to be providing higher intensity care (p < .01), to report difficulty with providing care (p < .01), and to report having unmet needs with care provision (p < .01). In addition, caregivers who provided higher intensity care and reported having unmet needs with care provision were more likely than were caregivers who provided lower intensity care and did not report having unmet needs with care provision to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers (p < .01).The findings also revealed important differences between White, Black, and Hispanic caregivers. Black caregivers were more than twice as likely as White caregivers to provide higher intensity care (p < .01) and to report having unmet needs with care provision (p < .01). However, Black caregivers were half as likely as White caregivers to report having difficulty with providing care (p < .05). In contrast, comparisons between Hispanic and White caregivers revealed no significant differences in caregiving intensity, reported difficulty with care provision, and reports of having unmet needs with care provision. Discussion This study examined commonalties and differences in the experiences and challenges of representative samples of White, Black, and Hispanic informal caregivers in New York City. The results revealed a caregiver prevalence rate of 17% among households in New York City, a figure smaller than the 23% caregiver prevalence rate reported nationally (National Alliance for Caregiving and American Association for Retired Persons 1997   ). This inconsistency is most likely due to differences in geography, participant eligibility criteria, sampling techniques, and response rates. The results also revealed several common themes across the three groups of caregivers. First, the majority of the informal caregivers surveyed in this study were primary caregivers who had been providing care for at least 1 year, much of it complex, and with very little help from the formal health care system. Second, long-term caregivers (i.e., those who had provided care for at least 1 year) were more likely to report having unmet needs with care provision. Third, caregivers who reported difficulty with care provision were more likely to be providing higher intensity care and to report having unmet needs with care provision. Although more comprehensive in scope, these findings support previous observations on the complexities of caregiving and the dynamics of juggling one's own life in the midst of caring for a loved one in poor health (Dilworth-Anderson et al. 1999   ; Kosloski, Montgomery, and Karner 1999   ; Lawton et al. 1992   ; Levine et al. 2000   ; National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association for Retired Persons 1997   ; Navaie-Waliser et al. in press   ).As initially hypothesized, the findings revealed that caregiving workload, reported difficulty with care provision, and having unmet needs with care provision were not uniform across informal caregivers of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, these results underscore the importance of examining subgroups of caregivers for their special experiences and challenges rather than considering them undifferentiated members of a homogenous group of informal caregivers.Compared with White caregivers, Black caregivers appeared to have a heavier caregiving workload and were more likely to report having unmet needs with care provision. These findings concur with past studies (Fredman et al. 1995   ; Hinrichsen and Ramirez 1992   ; Mui 1992   ; Wykle and Segal 1991   ) and are consistent with broader observations of racial/ethnic disparities in access to health care services. Moreover, the intensity of care provided by these caregivers was not mitigated by the provision of formal care. This latter finding could be attributed to the different types of support needs addressed by informal versus formal caregivers (e.g., greater IADL and emotional care provided by informal caregivers versus ADL care provided by formal caregivers) or inadequate support from the system that provides formal caregiver services. It also could reflect cultural preferences for familiar informal caregivers rather than formal care provided by unknown service agencies or through government programs, as has been suggested in the literature (Barresi and Mennon 1990   ; Hing and Bloom 1990   ; Holmes, Teresi, and Holmes 1983   ; Kosloski et al. 1999   ; Marchi-Jones, Murphy, and Rousseau 1996   ). Given the delivery of higher intensity care and reports of having unmet needs with care provision, it might be expected that Black caregivers also would report greater difficulty with care provision. To the contrary, our results suggest the opposite. Black caregivers were half as likely as White caregivers to report difficulty with care provision, a finding that could be associated to their lower likelihood of being a primary caregiver. Other possible explanations that are consistent with related past observations could be lower reported stress levels (Farran et al. 1997   ; Miller and Snigdha 1999   ; Wallace, Levy-Storms, and Andersen 1997   ; Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kingston, and Andersen 1998   ) and perceptions of lower caregiving burden (Connel and Gibson 1997   ; Fredman et al. 1995   ; Knight et al. 2000   ) among Black caregivers when compared with White caregivers. Another finding that was consistent with past studies was that Black caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to experience increased religiosity since becoming caregivers, suggesting a greater reliance on religious beliefs as a potential coping strategy by this population (Nkongho and Archbold 1995   , Nkongho and Archbold 1996   ; Picot, Debanne, Namazi, and Wykle 1997   ; Wykle and Segal 1991   ).Few studies to date have compared the experiences and challenges of Hispanic and White caregivers. Results from the limited number of studies that have explored differences in these populations have suggested that Hispanic caregivers are more likely than White caregivers to be family members of the care recipient than friends (Holmes et al. 1983   ; Penrod et al. 1995   ; Tennstedt et al. 1989   ), to have unmet perceived needs (Mui 1992   ; Wykle and Segal 1991   ), and to engage in religious activities for coping purposes (Tix and Frazier 1998   ). Our findings concurred with only the last observation, suggesting that Hispanic caregivers appeal to religion or spirituality in dealing with the caregiving challenges. Although we found relatively little difference in caregiving workload, reported difficulty with rendering care, and unmet needs with care provision between Hispanic and White caregivers, Hispanic caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to receive help in care provision from formal care providers. However, given the relatively small number of Hispanics in this study, along with the small fraction of caregivers who reported receiving help from formal caregivers, this observation warrants cautious interpretation. Limitations of the Study This study's findings must be viewed in light of several survey limitations. First, it should be noted that the study was vulnerable to nonsampling errors such as nonresponse bias, coverage bias, item-response bias, and question-order and -context effects. The margin of error for estimates in this survey was 5%. Efforts were taken to minimize sources of error including pilot testing of the survey instrument with focus groups, devising alternative forms of the screening instrument, conducting pilot tests, training interviewers, and providing extensive supervision during the data collection phase of the study. Moreover, depending on response patterns, up to 50 attempts were made to contact selected eligible participants. Second, there was no information pertaining to the care recipients' cognitive functioning, the presence of comorbidities, or other relevant care recipient characteristics that could serve as indicators of need for formal and informal care. Third, the caregiver eligibility criteria used in this study were quite broad. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to certain populations of caregivers (e.g., caregivers who provide only direct hands-on care rather than coordinate the care needs of relatives and friends). Moreover, because the participant eligibility criteria used in this study did not include an age restriction that captured only older adult care recipients, the results are based on a relatively young sample of care recipients and, thus, may not be representative of the severely impaired population of care recipients who are likely to receive multiple forms of care (informal and formal) with varying intensity and cost. Fourth, although this study adds to our present knowledge about caregiving, some of its measures (e.g., the single-item binary indicator used to measure perceived unmet needs) are relatively weak. Future studies will need to expand on some of the measures in this study by devising related sets of questions with scaled response categories that would enable a more comprehensive examination of these measures. Fifth, given the challenges of collecting data by telephone surveys, this study's findings were based on lower than desirable response (60%) and cooperation rates (84%). Moreover, because this survey was conducted by telephone, it underrepresented households that did not have a telephone. Lastly, this study's findings were derived from relatively small samples of Black and Hispanic caregivers, thus caution is warranted in overgeneralizing the results to these populations. Strengths of the Study Despite its limitations, this study extends previous research on caregiving in several ways. First, unlike past surveys—which generally have been conducted on convenience (nonrandom) samples of informal caregivers—this study was based on data obtained from randomly selected representative samples of households with informal caregivers. Second, in contrast to past research that typically has considered informal caregivers a fairly homogenous population, the present study focused on comparisons between different groups of informal caregivers based on their racial/ethnic backgrounds. Third, this study is one of the first comparative studies to broadly examine the experiences and challenges of caregiving among White, Black, and Hispanic caregivers in a large metropolitan setting. Taken together, the present study addresses some of the methodological and content limitations in the caregiving literature by providing more generalizable results and additional insight into the world of caregivers.Informal caregivers are a tremendous social resource, providing an estimated $196 billion in uncompensated care (Arno, Levine, and Memmott 1999   ). Additional efforts should be made to gain insight about the experiences and challenges of different populations of informal caregivers to facilitate the development and implementation of culturally sensitive programs and policies that are supportive of the needs of these caregivers in their ever-expanding roles. Moreover, future studies should focus on exploring the potentially significant roles that community resources—in particular, religious institutions—could play in providing outreach and support to racial/ethnic minority caregivers.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: Using the perspectives of age, period, and cohort (APC) effects, this study explored the changes in attitudes toward supporting parents in Taiwan. Design and Methods: Population-representative cross-sectional data taken at 1984, 1990, and 1995 from the Social Change Survey in Taiwan were synthesized. Cohort tables and multi-nominal logistic regression were used to analyze the APC effects. Results: Period and age effects were found in the change in attitudes toward supporting parents. Agreement on living with sons or children has slowly decreased. Younger persons agree more than older ones in attitudes toward parents living with their married son or children. There was a reduction in the differences among cohorts across periods. There was no demonstration of cohort effect in this study. Implications: The results indicate that for married children, living with parents is no longer popular in Taiwan society. Social policy should address the unmet needs of elderly people in assistance with daily living.   Supporting parents ,  APC effects ,  Social change ,  Taiwan ,  Chinese culture Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDIssues in gerontology concern family support of elderly persons. In this article, we examine the changing attitudes of adult children in supporting their elderly parents, with special interest in social changes across years and among cohorts. In modern Taiwan, life expectancy is prolonged and more cohorts live in the same society. With social changes, not only family structure but also family values, gender roles and filial obligation in family caregiving have been transformed. Because social structure and social values often lag in response to these rapid changes (Riley and Riley 1994   ), there may be significant differences in the way different cohorts support elderly parents and the formal support resources may not yet meet people's needs. This may increase problems in caring for elders' health and life.The cultural ideal of supporting elderly parents varies globally. In Western culture, daughters are more likely than sons to be involved in caregiving and usually provide more assistance to their parents (Horowitz 1985   ; Ingersoll-Dayton, Starrels, and Dowler 1996   ). In Eastern culture, however, filial piety to parents is internalized by social norm, and sons and daughters-in-law take on the main responsibilities of family caregiving for the parents (Choi 1993   ; Shi 1993   ; Yamamoto and Wallhagen 1997   ). As a Chinese society, Taiwan has experienced dramatic population, economic, and social changes in the past century. It is of particular interest to determine whether traditional norms of supporting parents have been affected by recent social changes. The Social Changes in Taiwan The cultures and social structures of ancient Taiwan were brought from mainland China by Chinese ancestors. From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was colonized by Japan. Agriculture, health care, and education systems were improved during this period. After the civil war in China, the Nationalist Party (Kuo-Ming-Tung) took over the Taiwan political reign, and many soldiers and families immigrated from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949. Taiwan experienced dramatic and rapid economic growth after the 1960s, and it made a niche for itself among the world's industrial powers. Taiwan reached the final stage of population transition when the net reproduction rate fell below 1.0 by 1983 and the proportion of elderly people exceeded 7.0% after 1993. The household arrangement has transformed slowly; nuclear households have become more common (Weinstein, Sun, Chang, and Freedman 1990   ). Parent–child coresidence significantly declined from the 1960s to the 1990s (Chattopadhyay and Marsh 1999   ).In the past decade, there have been extensive large and comprehensive reforms in Taiwan. In 1986, Taiwan ended its Emergency Decree Law (a martial law). Since then, Taiwan has taken steps toward a multiparty democracy and free market conditions. Multilateral relationships have been opened with many countries, and Western culture has been thoroughly and comprehensively integrated into Taiwanese society. Social policies have been discussed and debated more than ever by the government and the people. A compulsory universal health insurance scheme was implemented in 1995. Long-term care regulations and plans were implemented during the 1990s. Many long-term care institutions and services were registered in this period.Owing to the dramatic social changes in Taiwan, we suspected that there would be some significant differences between the older and the younger cohorts in family values and attitudes toward supporting parents. Further, social reform and cultural changes in the recent decade might have had an impact on Taiwanese culture and family values. This provided an opportunity to examine whether intergenerational relationships and parental supports differed among different cohorts as a result of social changes.Studies of age, period, or cohort (APC) effects on children's attitudes toward supporting parents are very limited. Only some studies have pooled cross-sectional data to compare intergenerational relationships, household composition, or living arrangements in Taiwan. Changes in attitude toward parent–child living arrangements and financial support from children have been found from 1963 to 1991 (Chattopadhyay and Marsh 1999   ). Coresidence with parents after marriage declined from 1965 to 1985 (Weinstein et al. 1990   ), and separation of residence for parents and children before and after marriage has increased with younger birth cohorts (Thornton, Chang, and Sun 1984   ). These studies offer possible evidence that period effects and age or cohort effects on supporting parents might exist. However, none of these studies can elucidate more than one effect. The objective of this study was to explore whether there are APC effects on the attitudes toward support of parents in Taiwan's society. Conceptual Framework Supporting Parents in Taiwan In Chinese tradition, supporting parents is essential to filial piety, and sons carry the main responsibility to support parents. Filial piety is a virtue and obligation to the Chinese, and the most basic standard of filial piety is to satisfy parents' daily needs and to support them in their old age. Living with parents, supplying funds for their living, and taking care of their daily needs are the most basic obligation for traditional Chinese people in supporting their parents. In the past, adult children would be considered to have violated tradition and be condemned by society if they let their parents live alone but supported their living expenses or even left their parents to manage their daily living independently. If there were several children in the family, parents might choose to live with one child permanently after family division. Otherwise, they might live with each child in turn, known as "meal rotation." Meal rotation would be another way to show the effort to satisfy the filial obligation to support parents (Hsieh 1986   ).Traditional Chinese society is patrilineal, so sons are expected to live with their parents and to provide their financial support. Married daughters are no longer considered members of their maiden family; they are the daughters-in-law of their husbands' families. Parents-in-law expect their daughters-in-law to take care of them and to do all the household tasks. If the daughter-in-law devotes too much of her money, time, or resources to her maiden family, her husband's family often feels uncomfortable.In modern Taiwanese society, however, it is no longer common for married sons to live with their parents, and meal rotation has declined. These changes accompany the decrease of stem families and extended families (Wen, Chang, Chang, and Chu 1989   ). Nowadays, it is more permissable for daughters to take care of their maiden families, although their obligations to their husbands' families still hold.Thus, the traditional way to support parents is for them to live with sons after marriage. Not only do they consider sons to be responsible for taking care of them, they also take for granted that daughters-in-law should take care of all the household tasks. Parents may live with one son steadily or take turns among sons, depending on the availability of sons. Even if parents do not insist on living with married sons, they still hope that children and parents will live together. The last choice would be that they live separately.Other factors relating to the attitude toward supporting parents include age, gender, marriage, education, ethics, work status, parents' health or needs, living area, and urbanization (Chang 1994   ; Chen 1996   ; Lee, Parish, and Willis 1994   ). Analyzing APC Effects APC effects have been discussed earlier by social scientists. Riley 1971    age stratification theory mentions that differences in age strata result from different life courses and periods of history. This theory suggests that there is a distinctive subculture in each age strata, giving hints to observing cultures across ages or cohorts. However, the theory does not consider the period effect apart from age or cohort effect, and the age or cohort effect cannot be distinguished by observing the age–strata difference.Because APC effects are dependent, it is difficult to separate each effect both conceptually and methodologically from cross-time data. The cohort table method may be the simplest way in demographics to observe the transition across years and cohorts. However, this method cannot distinguish APC effects because of sampling variability, compositional changes, and confounding factors (Glenn 1977   ). Palmore 1978    has distinguished between the level of analysis and the effects. The difference in longitudinal data is composed of age effect and period effects. The cross-sectional difference is composed of age and cohort effects, and the time-lag difference reflects the period effect minus the cohort effect. Fienberg and Mason 1985    discussed the specification and implementation of APC models. They have reviewed different kinds of data structures that can be used for analytical approaches. They suggested a multilayered analysis framework, which was worthy for conceptual clarification though difficult to achieve.Epidemiological studies have developed many alternative models to quantify APC effects, such as equating two or more effects, zero period slope, period and cohort drift, or using complex models (Clayton and Schifflers 1987a   , Clayton and Schifflers 1987b   ; Holford 1991   ). Some of these models are easy to apply, but more assumptions are required. Because of the unidentifiable problems in data analysis, some resolutions have been recommended (Holford 1991   ), including the two-factor model.In the two-factor model, only two factors are used to describe the data, assuming one of the three factors is unimportant and omitted in the analysis. The strategy of using a two-factor model has been described (Kupper, Janis, Karmous, and Greenberg 1985   ). Each of the three two-factor models is fitted to the data and measures the goodness of fit of these models. A two-factor model is appropriate if the model is best fitted to the data and also not significantly different from the three-factor model. However, there is still bias in parametric estimation if the effects of these time-relevant variables are not linear.The definition of APC effects as regards attitudes toward supporting parents is the following: The age effect refers to change in attitude toward supporting parents as people get older because their psychological and/or social roles have changed; the period effect refers to the change in attitudes toward supporting parents resulting from the social changes in Taiwan; and the cohort effect refers to the shift in the historical and cultural situation resulting from the cohort's difference in attitude toward supporting parents. Methods Data The data in this article are taken from the Social Change Survey in Taiwan (SCS), collected by the Institute of Ethnology and Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica. The SCS was first conducted in 1984 and has been continued annually since 1990. This data set is the largest scaled academic survey in Taiwan, and the samples are representative of the Taiwanese population. The yearly survey repeats investigation topics every 5 years. Multiple-stage probability sampling was used to get the nationwide samples. In the present study, we used complementary samples in 1984, 1990, and 1995 (abbreviated as SCS84, SCS90, and SCS95) with samples sizes of 1,750, 2,532, and 2,081, respectively. Samples Our first step was to select eligible samples so that the birth cohorts of the samples in all three investigations were within the same range for comparison. The original samples were divided into every-5-year age groups, resulting in a total of 16 groups (see  Table 1  ). The dates of birth of the SCS84 cohorts ranged from before 1900 to 1964 (aged 20–88); for SCS90, from 1925 to 1974 (aged 16–65); and for SCS95, from 1920 to 1974 (aged 21–75). The eligible samples included those born between 1925 and 1964 (8 groups). The SCS84 samples were aged from 20 to 59; the SCS90 samples, from 26 to 64; and the SCS95 samples, from 31 to 70.Second, it was necessary to weight the samples to make the results appropriate for generalization to the Taiwanese population. Samples were stratified by birth cohort and gender and then compared with the same cohort and gender population in an area of Taiwan in 1984, 1990, and 1995, respectively. The weights were calculated to make the proportion of each stratum in the samples the same as that of the corresponding one in the population in the same year. The samples are then weighted for analysis.The goodness of fit of the final samples in each birth cohort and gender was not significantly different from the weighted eligible samples. In our final analysis, the sample sizes of SCS84, SCS90, and SCS95 were 3,364, 1,433, and 1,174, respectively, with a total of 5,971. Measurement Dependent Variable. The dependent variable was attitude toward living arrangements for married children and their parents. Respondents were asked, "What do you think the living arrangement for parents and their married children should be?" The options included parents live in each child's house in turn, parents live in each son's house in turn, parents live in one son's house, parents live in married daughter's house, parents do not live with their children but are supported financially by them, parents live alone and manage their own living expenses, married children remain living in parents' house, and others.We grouped these options into three categories: living with sons, living with children, and not living together. Living with children meant that living with either sons or daughters was fine, whereas living with sons indicated the preference to live only with sons. The categories were determined according to the traditional level of parental support. Living with sons is the most traditional way; not living together is the least traditional.The respondents who preferred living with married daughters were not included in the analysis because there were not enough responses for analysis. Options such as depending on parents' willingness or no opinion were also excluded. Independent Variables. Cohorts were divided into 5-year groups in cohort table analysis. In two-factor models, cohorts were put as three groups—1925–1934, 1935–1949, and 1950–1964—by considering major social events. Age was counted for each subject's age during the survey year, and we used 40 years of age as the cutoff point. We considered 40 the age at which the subject's social role changed. Other demographic variables included education (low: illiterate or elementary school; high: junior high school or over), gender (female or male), job (yes or no), marital status (married or unmarried), and ethnicity (Ming-Nan, Hakka, or mainlanders). Ming-Nan, Hakka, and mainlanders are the three major ethnic groups in Taiwan. Each ethnic group has its own dialect and slightly different culture. Data Analysis We used two methods of analysis:Cohort tables: Tables were constructed to show the transition among different cohorts and across years. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether the differences among cohorts were significant.Two-factor models of logistic regression: Data from three investigations were merged and then used in the analysis of the cohort–period model, the age–period model, and the cohort–age model. Not living together was the reference group for the dependent variable, and the other two groups were response groups for multinominal logistic regressions. The strategy for judging time-relevant effects (cohort, age, or period) was one of the three factors that might be related to the attitudes toward supporting parents if the effect was significant in two of the three two-factor models. Because the variables for the three investigations were not the same, demographic variables were put in the models as confounders. Two-way interactions of time-relevant effects were put in the model to appropriately estimate the linear effect (Fienberg and Mason 1985   ). Education and marital status interaction terms were also put in the model because those main effects are significant and related to cohorts or ages. Limitations and Assumptions The major limitations of this study resulted from the characteristics of the combination of three cross-sectional investigations. First, due to identification of APC effects, two-factor models were used with the assumption that one of the three effects is not considered. More data are needed to support the reasonableness of this assumption. It is discussed in the Results section.Second, because the data points were too limited to do further APC analysis, advanced statistical analysis methods were not used. In addition, the problem of unbalanced design could not be resolved using further analysis because of insufficient data points. We assumed that the effects of a 6-year interval were not different from the effects of a 5-year interval for the 1984–1990 period effect.Third, the samples were not from a panel study. We assumed the sample variation, population composition, and confounders of the three investigations did not influence the research topic significantly. The assumption of sample variation might be weak. Although the age and gender compositions of analysis sample in all three investigations were not significantly different from one another after weighting, other characteristics might be different (see  Table 1  ). However, no special social, biological, or natural phenomena appeared, so the demographic composition and the confounders of populations across the years were assumed to be the same in this study. Results The characteristics of the analysis samples are shown in  Table 1  . The proportions of each birth cohort across the three survey years were similar: There were about 15% in the 1925–1934 group, 45% in the 1935–1954 group, and about 40% in the 1955–1964 group. The age distributions within survey years were from 20 to 70 years old, and there were more men than women. Most (over 70%) were of Ming-Nan ethnicity. About 9% were illiterate, one third had an elementary school education, and about 56% had higher education. About 68% had jobs. There were more married people in 1995 than in 1984, probably because the samples selected were older in 1995. Data on responses to the dependent variable, parents' support, are listed at the bottom of  Table 1  . About 33% of the respondents preferred that parents live with married sons, similar across the three survey years. The proportion of those not living together was much higher in 1995 (37.4%) than in 1984 (24%). Cohort Tables In order to see the trend by cohort table, we grouped the three responses to the dependent variable in two ways: the proportion of those in favor of living with sons versus living with any child or not together ( Table 2  ) and the proportion in favor of living together (with any child) versus not living together ( Table 3  ).About one third of those sampled preferred living with son (see  Table 2  ). The average percentages of those in favor of living with sons over the three survey years were similar (ranging from 33.7% to 31.7%). When observing the cohorts within 1984 (cross-sectional difference), the younger the cohort, the higher the approval rate, except for the 1960–1964 cohort. The differences between cohorts were significant in 1984, but not in 1990 or 1995. In fact, the greatest gap between the lowest and the highest rate was during 1984 (from 25.9% to 38.1%). The gaps between cohorts then decreased in 1990 and 1995.Looking across the rows of  Table 2  at the changes in birth cohorts across periods, the approval rate in the 1940–1954 group declined consistently over the survey periods. Looking diagonally down and to the right of  Table 2  at intercohort differences at the same age, one finds that the approval rate declined almost in all age groups, except the oldest one. For example, at the age of 55, the approval rate of the 1930–34 cohort was 33%, the approval rate of the 1935–39 cohort was 32.7%, and the approval rate of the 1940–44 cohort was 27.8%.The rates of preference for living with sons or any children are shown in  Table 3  . The approval rate increased concurrently with the younger birth cohorts during a survey year. The approval rate in 1984 was about 70%–80%; in 1990, 63%–77%; and in 1995, 54%–66%. The differences among cohorts were significant in 1984 and 1990.The average rate declined from 76% in 1984 to 72% in 1990, and continued decreasing to 62.7% in 1995. A decreasing trend was also observed in each individual birth cohort across periods. The rates for almost all the birth cohorts decreased substantially from 1990 to 1995; the decrease for each cohort was smaller from 1984 to 1990. Looking at changes in rates for the same age group (looking diagonally down and to the right), one finds similar results as for changes among cohorts.From the preliminary analysis of cohort tables, some cross-sectional and the time-lag differences were observed. The effects were combined, however. Further analysis was then conducted. Two-Factor Models of Polytomous Logistic Regression Analysis We analyzed two-factor models to explore further whether a cohort, age, or period effect existed, and the results are shown in  Table 4  . Model A was a cohort–period model, model B, an age–period model, and Model C, a cohort–age model.Models A and B were compared first. The period effects of 1984 versus 1995 and of 1990 versus 1995, were both significant in Models A and B. Comparing the attitude of living with son to that of not living together (see upper part of  Table 4  ), and of living with any child to not living together (see lower part of  Table 4  ), the odds ratios of 1984 versus 1995 were higher than the odds ratios of 1990 versus 1995 in both Models A and B. People were about 1.3 to 1.7 times more likely to agree that parents should live with their sons versus not live together in 1984 than in 1990 or 1995. The odds ratios of those preferring living with children versus not living together were even higher, about 2.0–2.5 times more at 1984 than at 1995 and 1.7–1.9 times more at 1990 than at 1995. The period effect may have accumulated over 10 years because the odds ratio of 1984 versus 1995 was a little higher than that for 1990 versus 1995.Models B and C were then compared to find the age effect. At ages older than 40, the approval rate for parents living with sons or with children much decreased. The odds ratios of the 40-and-older groups were all about half less approving of living with sons versus not living together. People who preferred living with children versus not living together were fewer over age 40 (odds ratios ranged from 0.371 to 0.598). Age effects were significant in both models.Finally, we compared Models A and C. Only the odds ratio of living with sons versus not living together for the 1935–1949 cohort was significant in both models. The 1935–1949 cohort was about half less likely than the 1950–1964 cohort to approve living with sons. No confident conclusion could be made regarding the cohort effect.The two-factor models did not fit the data quite well because the common controlling variables in three surveys were not available, so Kuppers and colleagues (1985) strategy of choosing the best-fit model to make conclusions does not seem suitable in this case. Other information and the reasonableness of the results must be examined before making conclusions.First, we conducted another analysis. We hypothesized that there were period and cohort effects. Age was treated as a continuous variable and put in the logistic regression model as a confounding factor to estimate the period and cohort effects. The result showed that the period effect was significant, and the cohort effect was not. The control variable age was still significant in the model. The data did not seem to show evidence of a cohort effect.Second, we examined the reasonableness of the assumptions in the two-factor models. The assumption of no period effect was first rejected because there have been dramatic social changes in Taiwan in the past decade. And the assumption of no age effect seems unlikely. Chang 1994    has compared the attitudes for the same respondents toward supporting parents when they are children or parents and found that attitudes toward supporting parents differed with social role, which was more likely to be an age effect than a cohort effect. In other research (Yeh 1997   ), the concept of filial piety—"supporting parents out of respect and to worship your forefathers" (p. 202)—was still maintained high across cohorts. Yeh implied that there were no cohort differences in filial piety or in attitude toward supporting parents. Although the birth cohorts in this study experienced different historical situations (before and after Japanese colonization), the attitude toward supporting parents might not have changed dramatically because the Chinese and Japanese cultures are similar. There is no evidence that the difference in attitude toward supporting parents came from the shift in historical situation. So there was no significant cohort effect on attitudes toward supporting parents, and age and period effects were concluded to be present. Discussion Although the concepts of APC effects have been discussed earlier by social scientists and some analysis methods have been developed, few studies have tried to explore APC effects on the issue of supporting parents in Eastern culture. This study explored APC effects on attitudes toward supporting parents in Taiwan. The new findings of APC effects on supporting parents have brought some pioneering information of different cultural content to gerontology researchers.We found period and age effects in this study. Nevertheless, there was no proof of a cohort effect. With the passage of time, the gaps among different cohorts as a proportion of those who approved of living with sons have decreased while the overall decrease is slowing down. Thus, the influence of social change on attitudes toward support-by-son has been stable (about 30% of people). However, the difference in attitudes toward living with any child among cohorts still exists, although the overall cohort average decreased slowly and consistently.Period effect was cumulative from 1984 through 1995. The approval rate of living with sons or children decreased slowly. A similar finding was reported by Chattopadhyay and Marsh 1999    and is consistent with the direction of social changes. People leaving their hometowns for jobs has become more and more common, and in recent decades married children have often settled their families far from their birthplace. This is not only because of social mobility (Attias-Donfut 2000   ), but also because the concept of filial piety has changed in modern Taiwanese society. With these changes in filial piety, obligation has decreased, and the approaches to filial piety have diversified (Yang 1988   ). Our study indicated that parents cannot compel their children to live with them as in the old days, and the ways in which children show filial piety nowadays is no longer limited to coresidence of parents and children.Another finding of this study was the age effect. Younger people agreed more than older people that married children should live with their parents. We used age 40 as the cutoff point in the two-factor models in consideration of life course. People older than 40 are usually busy dealing with their marriages, children, and jobs, while their parents are getting older and beginning to demand some care. The children's social roles make them understand the real burden of living with parents when they have to deal with those multiple life stresses. In comparison, people under 40 years old may retain a naïve fantasy about living with parents and consider such a living arrangement as possibly resolving some problems associated with supporting their parents. Another explanation is that people under 40 years old are more affected by social desirability and are not willing to give an answer deviating from the tradition concerning the support to parents.The cohort effect was not statistically significant. The probable explanations include the following: The cohort effect was explained by the age effect or mixed with the age effect; the models lacked important confounders, so the cohort effect could not be shown; or the cohort effect was just insignificant.In this study, we found that variation in supporting parents among different cohorts or ages has been reduced in modern Taiwan, indicating the convergence of attitude toward supporting parents. Attias-Donfut 2000    also pointed to a reduction of generational differences through social and cultural exchanges within families. The current study supported the "age integration" phenomenon (Riley and Riley 1994   ).The aggregated cross-sectional data in this study were limited due to their nonrepeated measurements and few data points. To further explore APC effects, longitudinal panel data should be used. In addition, living arrangement was the only topic of supporting parents discussed in this study. Further studies should explore APC effects on other topics of supporting parents in Taiwan, such as meal rotation, the responsibility of the first son, and the variation in support in different levels of urbanization in Taiwan.This study implies that the norm of supporting parents and the pattern of the parent–child relationship in Taiwan may transform gradually. Children may look for alternative approaches to supporting parents other than coresidence, such as financial support, paid household services, and emotional support. Aged parents who live alone need additional assistance in their daily living. Whether all the life expense and care responsibility can substitute for formal services is doubtful. Social policy on elder care in Taiwan, or in other Asian countries, should consider the unmet needs of elderly people, in the dimensions of health care, daily living assistance, and emotional and social support. As in an old Chinese saying, "Nearby neighbors are better than faraway relatives," the importance of mutual help in the community should be emphasized. Many children and relatives live faraway in modern days. The construction of volunteer support networks and community care systems may in some way be the solution.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose of the Study: This study was initiated to forecast the number of older drivers and passengers who may be fatally injured in traffic crashes in future years. Design and Methods: The study was based on data from the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System covering the period from 1975 to 1998. Projections were based on least squares regression models. Results: About 35,000 drivers and passengers died in traffic crashes each year from 1975 to 1998. Older adults (65 and older) accounted for 10% of all fatalities in 1975, 17% in 1998, and a projected 27% by 2015, the same proportion predicted for drivers and passengers aged younger than 30. On the basis of these projections, the number of fatally injured women and men aged 65 and older will increase respectively by 373% and 271% between 1975 and 2015. Implications: If current trends continue, the number of fatalities among older drivers and passengers and those aged younger than 30, may be equivalent early in this century. These projections call for further research into conditions that may lead to crashes involving older drivers and for the development and implementation of initiatives to curb traffic-related fatalities among older adults.   Fatalities ,  Older adults ,  Crashes ,  Trends ,  Projections Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDTraffic fatalities represent a serious public health issue, one usually attributed to young drivers. The common observation is that the magnitude of the problem posed by older drivers is relatively small compared with that of younger drivers, because there are fewer older drivers and they drive fewer miles (Brorsson 1989   ; McGwin and Brown 1999   ; Ryan, Legge, and Rosman 1998   ; Whitfield and Fife 1987   ). However, despite these assurances, safety analysts and planners are increasingly concerned by the demographic changes facing our society and the potential crash risk posed by older drivers (Janke 1991   ). One reason for this concern is that although fewer older drivers are involved in fatal crashes compared with other age groups, older drivers represent a crash risk equivalent to that of younger drivers when exposure is taken into account. Crash risk, when accounted for exposure, usually follows a ∪-shaped curve, starting high for young drivers, declining and remaining steady for experienced drivers, and then rising with drivers aged 65 and older (Brorsson 1989   ; McGwin and Brown 1999   ; Ryan, Legge, and Rosman 1998   ; Stutts and Martell 1992   ; Williams and Carsten 1989   ; Zhang, Fraser, Clarke, and Mao 1998   ).Predictions of the future involvement of older adults in crashes may provide some insight into this issue. Williams and Carsten courageously ventured a prediction (Williams and Carsten 1989   ). On the basis of their 1987 data, and census predictions, they reported that there would still be more than twice as many young drivers (younger than 30) involved in fatal crashes than older drivers (65 and older) by year 2030. This led them to conclude that crash issues related to older drivers "will remain relatively small well into the next century." (p. 327). However, past fatality trends paint a more alarming picture. Between 1980 and 1989, overall fatalities fell 20% from 19.8 per 100,000 drivers to 15.9. Despite this overall decrease, fatalities among drivers 65 and older increased 19% from 9.0 per 100,000 to 10.7. Whereas 2,323 drivers aged 65 and older died in 1980, accounting for only 8% of all 28,816 driver fatalities, 3,319 (13%) of all 26,389 drivers killed in 1989 were aged 65 and older (Barr 1991   ).This increase cannot be explained by demographics only. One possible explanation is that of cyclical and irregular fluctuations as is often observed with market-based data. Another possibility is an increase in exposure among older drivers. Data from North Carolina for the period from 1974 to 1988 illustrate this point (Stutts and Martell 1992   ). Whereas the proportion of residents aged 75 and older increased by 39%, the proportion of licensed drivers aged 75 and older increased by 129%, and the proportion of crashes involving this age group increased by 75%. Such changes in licensing rates are apparent in other jurisdictions as well. Overall in the United States, the proportion of licensed adults aged 65 and older passed from 62% in 1980 to 70% in 1989 (Barr 1991   ). Other researchers reported an increase from 61% in 1983 to 75% in 1990 (Massie, Campbell, and Williams 1995   ). In the United States, the proportion of adults aged 70 and older with valid driver's license is expected to more than double by 2020 (Eberhard 1996   ), and in Australia, the number of license holders among elderly adults is expected to double within the next 20 years (Darzins and Hull 1999   ). Distance traveled is also changing. From 1980 to 1989 the 65-and-older population increased their yearly distance traveled by 31% (Barr 1991   ). Comparing data for 1983 and 1990, drivers aged 75 and older increased their distance traveled by 90%, the largest percentage increase in travel by any age group (Massie et al. 1995   ).Similar issues apply to comparisons of men's and women's involvement in fatal crashes. Men consistently comprise a larger proportion of individuals involved in, and fatally injured in, crashes, an observation attributed to men's risk-taking behavior and women's lower exposure (Chipman, MacGregor, Smiley, and Lee-Gosselin 1993   ; Evans 1988a   ; Li, Baker, Langlois, and Kelen 1998   ; Massie et al. 1995   ; Massie, Green, and Campbell 1997   ; Stutts and Martell 1992   ; Whitfield and Fife 1987   ). However, older women's exposure is also changing. In North Carolina the number of licensed women aged 65 and older increased at four times the rate of men of the same age (Stutts and Martell 1992   ). Similarly, whereas less than 7% of all women and men aged 70 or older today hold a driver's license, this proportion will climb to 18% for women but only 13% for men by year 2020 (Eberhard 1996   ). Finally, women, who accounted for 33% of the distance traveled in the United States in 1983, accounted for 37% of the distance traveled in 1990 (Massie et al. 1995   ).The data on exposure highlight an increasing salient phenomenon. Although the demographic changes alone will create pressures on crash issues for older adults, these changes will be compounded by the increasing independence and mobility of coming older generations. Today's older adults are more likely to retire earlier, with more disposable income, and are more likely to maintain an active lifestyle (Fildes 1997   ). The coming generation of "baby boomers" will be more mobile than the current generation of older adults (Weinand 1996   ). Hence, available predictions of older adults' involvement in fatal accidents based only on demographics likely represent underestimates; updated predictions are required for the better planning of safety initiatives.From a safety-planning and policy perspective, the problems related to young drivers (e.g., aggressive driving, driving while impaired) are very different than those related to older drivers (e.g., health problems, attention or perception; Lilley, Arie, and Chilvers 1995   ). However, because young drivers account for the majority of fatalities, most safety initiatives target their needs, not those of older drivers. Yet, given that over 5,000 vehicle occupants aged 65 and older die each year, reducing this number by even a small percentage would translate into a large number of lives saved; fatalities are preventable events. Furthermore, safety initiatives may reduce the financial burden related to crashes. Traffic-related costs average about 2.5% of the gross national product of industrialized countries (Elvik 2000   ), and 3.2% of U.S. health care spending (Miller, Lestina, and Spicer 1998   ). Altogether, traffic-related costs in the United States alone exceed $50 billion per year (Miller, Lestina, Galbraith et al. 1997   ).Accordingly, the aim of this study was to forecast the future involvement of older adults, in comparison with younger and middle-aged adults, in fatal crashes, and that of older women in comparison with older men. To achieve this aim we used fatality data from previous years, and projected these trends into the future. Using data from previous years, other researchers have shown that older adults' fatalities increased at a faster rate than explained by demographics alone, probably because of changes in the number of licensed older adults and changes in distance traveled. Estimating fatalities from these data should provide a more accurate picture than that projected from census data alone. We hypothesized that older adults would make up an increasing proportion of all fatalities. Furthermore, because larger proportions of older women, compared with older men, are becoming licensed and using automobiles, we hypothesized that fatalities among women 65 and older would increase at a faster rate than that of men aged 65 and older. Methods Data This study relied on data contained in the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). For every U.S. traffic fatality, information about the crash situation, drivers and passengers, and the vehicles involved is collected and added to the FARS database. Data from 1975 to 1998 (inclusive) were available for the analyses. The total number of fatally injured individuals was calculated for each year. This number included all individuals involved, including pedestrians. Subsequently, analyses and projections focused on vehicle drivers and passengers only to facilitate the interpretation of the findings. Further analyses were conducted with age and gender stratified. Age was categorized as younger than 30, 30 to 64, and 65 and older. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses included counts and percentages, measures of association (chi-square), and time-series projections based on yearly fatality counts (to avoid the cyclical variations observed with seasonality) from 1975 to 1998 using a least squares regression model to provide the best fit to the actual data (Hamburg 1977   ). The least squares regression method was used to fit the actual number of fatalities recorded from 1975 to 1998 (Snedecor and Cochran 1989   ; Spiegel 1992   ). One regression model providing the best prediction of actual yearly fatality data was produced for each stratum studied (younger than 30, 30–64, all adults 65 and older, men 65 and older, and women 65 and older). The regression equations then were used to predict future fatalities to year 2015 (trend), a period of 17 years in addition to the available 24 years of data.Because the relationship between the number of fatalities and the year was possibly nonlinear, different curve estimations were used to determine the best fitting model. For each stratum the model best fitting the data was determined through a combination of the highest multiple correlation coefficient (r value) and visual fit of the data (George and Mallery 2000   ). Plotting the actual data against the predicted values of several models provides an initial judgment of the validity of the models tested (Snedecor and Cochran 1989   ). Furthermore, an additional criterion to select the best model was its parsimony as determined by its degrees of freedom. Specifically, in the presence of similar r values and visual fit, the model with the most degrees of freedom was selected (Dowdy and Wearden 1991   ). Results Fatalities From 1975 to 1998 For every year from 1975 to 1998, with the exception of 1992, more than 40,000 individuals were fatally injured in traffic-related incidents, totaling more than one million lives. When only drivers and passengers were considered, an average of more than 35,000 persons died each year. The number of driver and passenger fatalities remained relatively constant across years (see Total column,  Table 1  ). However, the characteristics of individuals accounting for these fatalities changed considerably over time. Age and Fatalities The proportion of fatally injured older drivers and passengers increased over time, whereas that of younger drivers and passengers decreased (see  Table 1  ). In 1975, 57% (20,214) of all fatalities were accounted for by individuals younger than 30. In 1985 it was 53% (18,897), and in 1998, this number had shrunk to 40% (14,176). In contrast, the 65-and-older group accounted for 10% (3,536) of all fatalities in 1975, 11% (4,062) in 1985, and 17% (6,022) in 1998, χ2(2, N = 66,907) = 1653.02, p = .001.We used the fatality data presented in  Table 1  to generate regression models (trend) to fit fatality data for each group. Logistic models best fit the data (see the  A ). The logistic model for the younger group, F(22) = 99.67, p < .001, r = .82, projected 9,701 fatalities by 2015, representing 27% of all fatalities. For drivers and passengers aged 30 to 64 the model, F(22) = 17.19, p < .001, r = .44, projected 16,125 fatalities (46% of all fatalities). For the older group the model, F(22) = 281.48, p < .001, r = .93, projected 9,569 fatalities by 2015, the equivalent of 27% of all fatalities (see  Fig. 1 ). Older Women and Men Total fatalities for men and women aged 65 and older rose by 70% between 1975 and 1998 (see  Table 2  ). Compared with men, women aged 65 and older accounted for only 37% of driver and passenger fatalities in 1975. This proportion rose to 44% by 1985 and reached 46% in 1998, χ2(2, N = 13,620) = 60.87, p = .001. Quadratic models best approximated actual data (see  A ) for both women, F(21) = 267.23, p < .001, r = .96, and men, F(21) = 160.40, p < .001, r = .94. Fatalities trends for adults aged 65 and older are presented in  Fig. 2 . If these projections are correct, the number of fatalities involving women 65 and older will rise by 373% between 1975 and 2015 (1,324 in 1975 to 4,941 by year 2015), and those involving men of this age group by 271% (2,212 in 1975 to 5,988 in 2015). Discussion The results of this study are consistent with other reports that fatalities are higher in young drivers and passengers. However, contrary to earlier predictions, the analyses presented here project an equally substantial involvement of young and older adults in fatal crashes by the year 2015. Drivers and passengers aged younger than 30 and those aged 65 and older may each represent 27% of all driver and passenger fatalities by year 2015. Furthermore, older women will make up a greater proportion of fatalities in coming years.These projections, however, assume that current trends will continue unabated. Events such as retraining, engineering advances, higher mobility, and lower or higher speed limits may result in lesser or higher fatalities than projected. Further, the impact of the baby-boomers generation on these projections remains difficult to assess. The baby boomers may be healthier than previous older generations (Allaire, LaValley, Evans, et al. 1999   ; Reynolds, Crimmins, and Saito 1998   ). However, this may result in a better ability to sustain the traumatic effects of crashes, yet at the same time encourage travel and increase exposure.In addition, it is not possible to extrapolate these findings to individual states or other countries; these projections provide overall trends for the United States only. Unique settings and older adult characteristics may affect future fatalities. For example, the changes in mobility observed in North Carolina may be occurring at different rates in other jurisdictions. Although projections could be established on a state-by-state basis, the underlying contributions of other sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., retirement income, health) cannot be determined from information contained in FARS. Another caveat of this study is the focus on fatal crashes only. It is unclear if older adults' involvement in nonfatal crashes will also increase in similar proportions.Notwithstanding these concerns, the projections presented here highlight the need for safety initiatives directed specifically at older adults. However, given that most past initiatives were directed at young drivers, the selection of initiatives appears limited. Imposing blanket restrictions on older drivers would not serve the goal of maximizing the independence of older adults while ensuring public safety and their own. Whereas the abilities of some older adults will decline below acceptable thresholds, that of many others will remain above these thresholds for their entire lives (Bedard, Molloy, Guyatt, Stones, and Strang 1997   ).Achieving a balance between public safety and older adults' own safety and independence can be realized by understanding why crashes and fatalities occur within older age groups. Three types of information must be obtained to reach this goal. First is the identification of situations in which older drivers may be at greater risk of initiating fatal crashes. Compared with young adults, older adults are overinvolved in crashes during the daytime (Mortimer and Fell 1989   ; Ryan, Legge, and Rosman 1998   ; Zhang, Fraser, Clarke, and Mao 1998   ), on weekdays (Zhang, et al. 1998   ), at intersections and merging situations (McGwin and Brown 1999   ; Pruesser, Williams, Ferguson, Ulmer, and Weinstein 1998   ; Ryan et al. 1998   ; Viano, Culver, Evans, Frick, and Scott 1990   ; Zhang et al. 1998   ), and during good weather (Zhang et al. 1998   ). Although useful, these data may result from higher exposure, higher crash initiation, or a combination of both. If researchers are to reduce crash risks in older adults, the crucial information needed is whether older adults are at greater risk of initiating crashes in some situations than in others. This information would allow researchers to devise age-specific interventions to reduce older adult involvement in crashes (Zhang et al. 1998   ). Furthermore, because many women have less driving experience than men (i.e., obtained their licenses later in life, drive lesser distance) their needs may be different than men's; they may possibly benefit from gender-specific interventions. Interventions aimed at older drivers, such as retraining, may yield substantial reductions in crashes while being cost-effective.The second type of information required is the identification of older drivers who may be at increased risk of initiating crashes. Whereas lack of experience, aggressive driving, and driving while impaired are related to crash initiation in younger drivers, reduced driving abilities and health-related impairments are more likely agents behind the increased risk of crashes among older drivers (Lilley et al. 1995   ; Retchin and Anapolle 1993   ; Reuben, Stilliman, and Traines 1988   ). Enhanced screening protocols and strategies, such as graduated licenses and copilots (Bedard, Molloy, and Lever 1998   ; Shua-Haim and Gross 1996   ), may reduce the risk of crash initiation among drivers whose abilities are declining. Larger scale testing of these options and others is desirable.The third type of information needed regards the greater susceptibility of older adults to fatal injuries (Evans 1988b   ). Although the aging human body may be less capable of sustaining trauma than younger bodies (Brorsson 1989   ; Evans 1988b   ; Viano et al. 1990   ), it is possible that vehicle characteristics (e.g., car design, seatbelts, air bags) provide a differential protective benefit to young and older adults and to men and women (Viano et al. 1990   ). A better understanding of the relationship between vehicle characteristics and fatal injuries may allow the development of strategies to enhance the probability of survival of older adults involved in crashes. Engineering advances targeted specifically to older adults may result in additional protection (Viano et al. 1990   ).The results of this study attest to a growing public health issue faced by all aging and increasingly mobile societies. Older adults will represent a sizable proportion of future traffic fatalities early in this century unless researchers step up the development and implementation of safety initiatives targeting their specific needs.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews Notes The logistic model is defined as     \[\mathit{y}={1}/{\left(\mathit{b}0\ \mathrm{*}\mathit{\ b}1^{t}\right)}\]  where y is the predicted number of yearly fatalities, b0 and b1 are regression coefficients (derived from fatality data for years 1975 to 1998), and t is the year, ranging from 1 (1975) to 24 (1998).The quadratic model is defined as     \[\mathit{y}=\mathit{b}0+\left(\mathit{b}1\ \mathrm{*}\mathit{\ t}\right)+\left(\mathit{b}2\ \mathrm{*}\mathit{\ t}^{2}\right)\]  where y is the predicted number of yearly fatalities, b0, b1, and b2 are regression coefficients (derived from fatality data for years 1975 to 1998), and t is the year, ranging from 1 (1975) to 24 (1998).

     Abstract Purpose of the Study: In this article, I examine the association between turnover of nursing home administrators and five important quality of care outcomes. Design and Methods: The data came from a survey of 420 nursing facilities and the 1999 On-line Survey, Certification, and Reporting System. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, I looked at the effects of turnover of administrators in nursing homes belonging to chain organi-zations and in nursing homes not belonging to chain organizations. Results: I found the average annual turnover rate of administrators to be 43%. The multivariate logistic regression analyses show that in nursing homes belonging to chains, administrator turnover is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs and with a higher than average number of quality-of-care deficiencies. In nursing homes not belonging to chains I found that turnover of administrators is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were restrained, were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs. Implications: There is a need to improve understanding of how and why better outcomes are achieved in some nursing homes. This investigation serves to focus attention on nursing home administrators. I believe this study provides preliminary evidence that the turnover of administrators may have an important association with quality of care in nursing homes.   Quality ,  OSCAR ,  Administrators Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDCaregivers in nursing homes have an important influence on quality of care. Previous research has shown turnover, staffing levels, and even the caregiving culture of registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and nurse aides to be influential in the quality of care (Curry, Wakefield, Price, Mueller, and McCloskey 1985   ; Davis 1991   ; Prescott 1986   ; Sheridan, White, and Fairchild 1992   ; Spector and Takada 1991   ). Researchers have paid scant attention as to whether other nursing home personnel affect the quality of resident care. For example, little research has determined if nursing home administrators actually make a difference within their institutions in terms of quality outcomes.This is surprising given that a large body of management research has determined that top managers make a difference in the success or failure of their firms (e.g., Weiner and Mahoney 1981   ). For example, unsuccessful firms have been shown to be headed by weak chief executive officers (CEOs; Miller and Friesen 1977   ). Conversely, strong CEOs have been shown to turn around failing organizations (Whitney 1987   ). Weiner and Mahoney 1981    examined 193 manufacturing firms over 20 years, and identified top managers as having a significant influence on outcomes such as the debt-to-equity ratio (Weiner and Mahoney 1981   ). Other researchers have suggested that "not only the institution's welfare but also that of the residents in the health service area is influenced by the … chief executive" (Hofmann 1977   , p. 86).In this article I examine the impact that turnover rates of nursing home administrators have on resident outcomes. Turnover rates are important because job performance can decrease with high rates (Etzioni 1964   ). For an administrator, determining the needs of residents may not be encouraged by high turnover rates (Riter 1995   ). In addition, many nursing homes are in financial difficulty, and others are operating close to the break-even point (Childs 2000   ). A recent report indicates that 48% of nursing facilities in some states are operating under bankruptcy proceedings (Childs 2000   ). Thus, the cost of training and recruiting new administrators could divert needed resources from care process in many facilities (Curry et al. 1985   ) and could affect resident care.A second important reason for examining administrator turnover is that these rates are high in some nursing homes, making understanding whether a link to resident outcomes exists even more pressing. Published literature on administrator turnover is rare. Rubin and Shuttlesworth 1986    determined the average turnover of administrators to be 33% per year. However, they examined few administrators (N = 72) with specialized training. A long-term care trade-magazine poll determined the turnover rate of administrators to average 20% per year (Gilbert 1995   ). A similar poll of the American Health Care Association and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging estimated turnover rates to be between 20% and 30% per year (Gilbert 1996   ). A recent study of administrators in Michigan and Indiana found annual turnover rates to be approximately 40% (Singh and Schwab 1998   ).Little research has examined the impact administrators may have on resident outcomes. Christensen and Beaver 1996    determined that nursing homes with lower administrator turnover rates had less deficiency citations (N = 147). Singh, Amidon, Shi, and Samuels 1996    also examined deficiency citations (N = 173) and found the same relationship as Christensen and Beaver 1996   . Although significant, these prior studies examined only one type of outcome and used relatively few observations. I examined the impact turnover of nursing home administrators has on the proportion of residents who are physically restrained, the proportion of residents who are catheterized, the proportion of residents who have pressure ulcers, the proportion of residents who are given psychoactive drugs, and the number of quality-of-care code violations. These are well-recognized indicators of quality in nursing homes (Garrard, Makris, Dunham, et al. 1991   ; Graber and Sloane 1995   ; Spector and Takada 1991   ). Shortell and associates have shown that a narrow focus on single outcome measures is misleading and may lead to erroneous, or incomplete, conclusions. By including five performance measures and more cases than previous studies, I felt my approach might better capture the overall effect of nursing home administrator turnover (Shortell, Zimmerman, Rousseau, et al. 1994   ).I hypothesized that the turnover of nursing home administrators would be associated with quality of care. That is, high administrator turnover would be associated with facilities with a higher proportion of residents who are physically restrained, catheterized, have pressure ulcers, or are given psychoactive drugs, and with a higher number of quality-of-care code violations than facilities with lower administrator turnover.Nursing home administrators do not directly provide resident care, but they are responsible for the care provided by caregivers in their facilities. As such, they can have a significant impact on the types of services provided and the quality of those services (Hofmann 1977   ). They do, for example, have significant influence over the facility budget and can control the distribution of monies for care and services.It would seem reasonable to believe that newly hired administrators will first attend to essential activities needed to keep the institution viable, such as staffing, billing, and purchasing. Indeed, the behavior of top managers is often characterized as reactive, and short run agendas, often consisting solely of financial objectives, consume the majority of the top manager's time (Kotter 1982   ). As Mintzberg 1990    has described, "if you ask a manager what he (she) does, he (she) will most likely tell you that he (she) plans, organizes, coordinates and controls. Then watch what he (she) does. Don't be surprised if you can't relate what you see to those four words" (p. 49). Because administrators, on joining a facility, probably need to become accustomed to the basic practices of the new facility, they are especially likely to attend to staffing, billing, and purchasing prior to planning and coordinating resident care.I examined nursing facilities belonging to chains and those not belonging to chains separately. When a facility is a member of a chain some economies of scale may be achieved. For example, the purchasing of equipment and supplies may be less expensive and, more importantly for this study, may be directed by the chain owners. This may be advantageous for the administrator in terms of time savings, because he or she may be freed from activities such as price negotiations, sales calls, and finding of reliable vendors. These time savings may then free the administrator to attend to resident care. In addition, some chains may rotate administrators through member facilities, promote from within member facilities, or use specialist "turnaround" administrative staff in poor performing or newly acquired institutions. Administrators working in chain facilities may also be subject to centralized administrative policies and have less autonomy. On the basis of these differences, I believe administrator turnover in nursing homes belonging to chains and homes not belonging to chains may not be directly comparable, and I therefore examined them separately in my analyses. Methods Sources of Data Data used in this investigation came from the 1999 On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) System and from a survey of 420 nursing facilities. The OSCAR is conducted by state licensure and certification agencies as part of the yearly Medicare/Medicaid certification process, and includes approximately 17,000 facilities (Government Accounting Office [GAO], 1998). I used data only from those 420 facilities that participated in my primary data collection.The OSCAR contains facility data and aggregated resident data. Resident data elements relevant to this study include the measures of quality I examined, that is, the number of residents who are physically restrained, catheterized, have pressure ulcers, or are given psychoactive medications. Facility data relevant to this study are the number of certification survey quality-of-care deficiencies (the sixth quality outcome I investigated), occupancy rate, and ownership.The OSCAR data are a widely used secondary source of nationally representative nursing home data (Harrington and Carrillo 1999   ; GAO 1998   , GAO 1999a   , GAO 1999b   , GAO 1999c   ). A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (IOM 2001   ) advocated the use of OSCAR data for research, but also cautioned that it does have some limitations.Three limitations of the OSCAR may bias my investigation. First, much of the data are self-reported by the nursing home administrator and director of nursing. This may be a minor limitation as it is doubtful whether facility factors such as ownership are subject to reporting bias.Most data elements pertaining to resident characteristics are verified by the surveyors, for example, the use and nonuse of psychoactive drugs and physical restraints. However, the information the surveyors report is pertinent only for the time they make rounds in the facility, which usually occurs during the day shift—24-hr observation is not used. This may bias some of my quality measures. For example, the use of physical restraints may be biased because other shifts may not follow day-shift practices. Restraint use may be higher at night when staffing levels are lower. I cannot determine whether my analysis is biased in this way, but if this is the case then the analysis is most representative of day-shift practices in the nursing home.A third limitation of the OSCAR is that facility practices may change when an inspection is anticipated. No prior notice is given when surveyors inspect facilities, but inspections are conducted within a fairly narrow window every 9 to 15 months.My primary data collection consisted of a questionnaire mailed to the administrator of 470 nursing facilities during the spring of 1999. The OSCAR data were from October 1999, but because of delays in compiling the data they match the time of my primary data collection. Facilities were from five states: Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Texas, and South Dakota. These states were chosen merely because they participated in the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) Multi-State Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration Project, and as such have been of interest to researchers. Facilities were randomly chosen, but I excluded hospital-based facilities and facilities that were part of a retirement center because they tend to be unrepresentative of other nursing homes in terms of both staff and clients (Burns and Taube 1984   ). These facilities are also predominantly not for profit (Singh and Schwab 1998   ). Quality Measures The documented prevalence rates of physical-restraint use vary widely. Recent studies have reported that 0% to 59% of residents are restrained (Ejaz, Folmar, Kaufmann, Rose, and Goldman 1994   ). Evidence shows that physical restraints are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Dube and Mitchell 1986   ; McHutchion and Morse 1989   ; Phillips, Hawes, and Fries 1993   ; Rovner, Edelman, Cox, and Shmuely 1992   ; Tinetti, Wen-Liang, Marottoli, and Ginter 1991   ). Documented morbidity includes an association with more frequent falls (Robbins et al. 1987   ), nosocomial infections (Rosen and DiGiacomo 1978   ), agitation (Marks 1992   ), and cognitive decline (Burton, German, Rovner, and Brant 1992   ). Moreover, Miles and Irvine 1992    estimated that at least 1 in every 1,000 nursing home deaths is the direct result of restraint use. They also suggested that these deaths are both underrecognized and underreported. Thus, lower levels of restraint use are generally regarded as beneficial.Prevalence rates of urethral catheterization in nursing homes range from a low of 1.5% of residents to a high of 21% (Riberio and Smith 1985   ). Spector and Takada 1991    found that urethral catheterization was associated with functional decline of residents. Thus, catheterization rates can have a significant effect on the quality of resident care (Ouslander and Kane 1984   ).Pressure ulcers can be a significant factor in the quality of life of nursing home residents. They may take months to heal, and are associated with much suffering and increased risk of death (Allman 1989   ; Berlowitz, Bezerra, and Brandeis 2000   ; Brandeis, Morris, Nash, and Lipsitz 1990   ). Even though guidelines for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers are well established and circulated by organizations such as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, their prevalence and incidence vary widely. Those nursing homes with the lowest prevalence of pressure ulcers have rates close to 0%, whereas those nursing homes with the highest prevalence have rates as high as 20% (OSCAR, 1999).A variety of studies have shown that the use of psychoactive drugs varies significantly between nursing homes (Kane, Williams, Williams, and Kane 1993   ). Some of this variation was shown to be due to factors unrelated to resident status or to inappropriate use (Ray, Federspiel, and Schaffner 1980   ; Beers, Avorn, Soumerai, et al. 1988   ). For example, Beers and associates 1988    found that 61% of residents taking antidepressants did not have a recorded diagnosis of depression. Similarly, Burns and Kamerow 1988    found that 30% of residents for whom psychoactive drugs were ordered did not have any symptoms that necessitated their use. One reason for these discrepancies was that in nursing homes psychoactive drugs were sometimes used to control disruptive behavior and nocturnal restlessness (Garrard et al. 1991   ; Ray et al. 1980   )—because they were used in this way these drugs became known as "chemical restraints." These drugs are also problematic, in that, although they do reduce acute agitation, they are less efficacious for long-term control of chronic behavior problems, are often accompanied by errors in prescription, and have documented adverse side effects (Burns and Kamerow 1988   ). Thus, when case mix is taken into account, lower levels of psychoactive drug use are generally regarded as beneficial.Finally, nursing home code violations (deficiencies) are problems in quality as identified by state or federal nursing home inspectors. HCFA is responsible for ensuring nursing homes meet quality standards. As I discuss for the OSCAR data, in the Medicare/Medicaid certification process HCFA certifies approximately 17,000 nursing homes per year. When a facility does not meet a standard, a deficiency citation is issued. These may be related to any area of operation in the nursing home, such as resident care, management of the facility, or staffing. Following other research, I used 19 deficiencies identified as quality-of-care deficiencies (GAO 1999a   ). Nursing home code violations are frequently used quality measures; for example, they were used in four recent government reports addressing quality problems (GAO 1998   , GAO 1999a   , GAO 1999b   , GAO 1999c   ). These violations are also often used in research studies as measures of quality (Davis 1991   ; Graber and Sloane 1995   ; Holmes 1996   ; Mukamel 1997   ). Analytic Approach I examined the correlations between the variables (not reported). The correlations between most variables were small, and on the basis of a threshold of .8 showed no problems of collinearity (Kennedy 1992   ). Also, values for regression tolerance statistics (not reported) showed no problems of multicollinearity (SAS Institute 1990   ).I conducted two sets of analyses. In the first set of analyses I looked at the effects of turnover of administrators in nursing homes belonging to chain organizations, in the second set of analyses I looked at the effects of turnover of administrators in nursing homes not belonging to chain organizations. For each of these groups of nursing homes five multivariate logistic regression analyses were used, one for each of the dependent variables.Multivariate logistic regression estimates the probability of mutually exclusive events (e.g., citation or no citation) and as such is most often used with dichotomous dependent variables (Demaris 1992   ). To create dichotomous dependent variables, I used the overall mean scores of these variables as cutoff points, giving for each dependent variable two groups of facilities, one with higher than average scores (coded as 1) and one with lower than average scores (coded as 0). In evaluating the effects of the independent variables included in the analyses, odds ratios were calculated by taking the exponent of the parameter estimates (Demaris 1992   ).The number of quality-of-care related deficiencies were manipulated to facilitate my statistical analyses and require further explanation. The use of nursing home code violations varies from state to state (Day and Klein 1987   ). Thus, the number of code violations received by a facility in one state is not comparable to those received by a facility in another state. Given the difficulty in comparing the actual number of code violations, I compared facilities across states using the percentile rank determined from the facility's relative standing within its state. Others have found this approach useful (Castle 2000   ). Again, to create dichotomous dependent variables, I used the overall mean scores of these variables as cutoff points (50th percentile), giving for each dependent variable two groups of facilities, one with higher than average deficiencies (coded as 1) and one with lower than average deficiencies (coded as 0).The questionnaire was part of an ongoing study examining nursing home outcomes. Facilities were previously provided with detailed outcome materials; this prior relationship may explain the high response rate (85%) of the study. In comparing the facility characteristics of staffing, ownership, and size, the nonrespondents to the survey were not significantly different from the respondents. Of the 423 survey respondents, missing data were present for the independent variable of interest (turnover) in only 3 cases, giving an analytic sample of 420. Missing cases for the other independent variables represented less than 1% for all of these variables. Model Specification and Operationalization The definitions for the dependent variables are given in  Table 1  . The definitions for the proportion of residents who are physically restrained, the proportion of residents who are catheterized, the proportion of residents having pressure ulcers, and the number of quality-of-care related deficiencies are evident from the table; the proportion of residents given psychoactive drugs needs further explanation. Psychoactive drugs are defined as medications "that affect psychic function, behavior, or experience" (Harrington, Tompkins, Curtis, and Grant 1992   , p. 823). They are generally classified as one of four types of medication: antianxiety, sedative/hypnotic, antipsychotic, or antidepressant. As discussed previously, the general concern with the first three groups of psychoactive drugs is that the rates of use may be excessive and/or clinically unjustified; however, there is also a concern that antidepressants may in some cases be underused in nursing homes (Harrington et al. 1992   ). Thus, antidepressants were not included in this investigation, and the remaining psychoactive drugs were grouped together.Administrator turnover is measured as the percent turnover of administrators per year. A question on my survey asked for the "number of administrators that had moved from the facility (for any reason) during the past 5 years." I did not ask administrators to calculate a yearly turnover rate, rather I used the 5-year figure provided to calculate this rate. I was concerned that administrators would be unable to accurately respond to this question because of the relatively long time frame, therefore an "unable to ascertain" option was provided in the questionnaire. Only three administrators used this option; nonetheless I am unable to verify the degree of measurement error associated with the dependent variable. In administering the questionnaire, I took a narrow definition of nursing home administrators and included only the administrator of record, whether they were full time, part time, or on contract with the nursing home. Assistant administrators and staff ancillary to the administrator were not included in the turnover rate.In examining the effects of turnover of administrators on resident outcomes, I controlled for the severity of physical illnesses among residents using the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). For each of the six ADL questions (difficulty with bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, feeding, or walking) in the OSCAR, I assigned a score from 0 to 1 by summing the responses regarding the proportion of residents with these difficulties. The average of these proportions was used. A variable percent of residents with skilled-care needs and with dementia was also used to further case-mix adjust the resident populations in each nursing home (Mor, Banaszak-Holl, and Zinn 1996   ). These skilled-care needs include the percentage of residents on respiratory therapy, intravenous blood transfusions, suctioning, tracheostomy, and tube fed. The number of residents with these conditions was divided by the total number of residents to create a variable indicating the percentage of residents with these needs.I also controlled for staffing levels within facilities, because increased staffing levels will enable individual staff to increase the time they spend in direct patient care, and in turn will benefit residents (Rudman, Slater, Richardson, and Mattson 1993   ; Davis 1991   ). Staffing may also be associated with deficiency citations (Harrington and Carrillo 1999   ; Harrington, Zimmerman, Karon, Robinson, and Beutel 2000   ). I included full-time equivalent (FTE) per resident LPNs and RNs, nurse aides, and medical directors. Although they are not involved in resident care, I also included the FTE per resident of administrative staff with the belief that in understaffed facilities the administrator will be more likely to turn over.I know from other long-term care outcome studies that facility factors have a strong impact on clinical outcomes. Therefore, I also controlled for several of these factors. Occupancy, ownership, size, and private-pay census were included as facility-level variables (Holmes 1996   ; Mukamel 1997   ; Spector and Takada 1991   ). Results  Table 1  presents the descriptive data. There were 221 nursing homes belonging to chains. The average proportions of residents who were restrained, had pressure ulcers, were catheterized, and were taking psychoactive drugs were 0.19, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.35, respectively. These nursing homes also had an average of 3.71 quality-of-care related deficiencies. There were 199 nursing homes not belonging to chains. The proportions of residents who were restrained, had pressure ulcers, were catheterized, and were taking psychoactive drugs were 0.18, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.34, respectively. These nursing homes had an average of 3.95 quality-of-care related deficiencies. Of particular interest, administrator turnover was quite frequent. In chain facilities administrator turnover averaged 45% per year, with one facility reporting having employed 10 different administrators in 5 years. In nonchain facilities administrator turnover averaged 41% per year, with three facilities reporting having employed nine different administrators in 5 years.Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the five logistic regression models for restraint use, catheterization, pressure ulcers, psychoactive drugs, and quality-of-care related deficiencies in chain nursing homes are presented in  Table 2  . Using the same dependent variables, I present AOR and 95% CI for five logistic regression models in freestanding nursing homes in  Table 3  . First, it should be noted that the pseudo-R2 values in these 10 logistic regression analyses range from .16 to .30. Values in this range are common in examining quality-of-care outcomes (Shea, Smyer, and Streit 1994   ). Table 2  shows administrator turnover was significantly associated with four of the five quality-of-care outcomes examined. Specifically, administrator turnover was significantly associated with the proportion of residents who were catheterized, the proportion of residents with pressure ulcers, the proportion of residents given psychoactive drugs, and the number of quality-of-care related deficiencies in chain nursing homes. In all cases the odds ratios were in the expected directions; that is, as administrator turnover increased the association with the dependent variables increased. For example, a 10% increase in administrator turnover was associated with a 9% increase in the odds that a facility will have higher than average psychoactive drug use compared with lower than average. Among the control variables, ADLs, special care needs, FTE RNs and LPNs per resident, FTE nurse aides per resident, ownership, and private-pay census were consistently significantly associated with the dependent variables. Staffing levels of RNs and LPNs, staffing levels of nurse aides, and for-profit ownership were particularly noteworthy. As FTE staffing levels of RNs and LPNs and staffing levels of nurse aides increased, the association with the dependent variables decreased, whereas for-profit ownership was consistently associated with an increase in the dependent variables. Table 3  shows administrator turnover was significantly associated with four of the five quality-of-care outcomes examined. Specifically, administrator turnover was significantly associated with the proportion of residents who were restrained, the proportion of residents with pressure ulcers, and the proportion of residents given psychoactive drugs in nonchain nursing homes. In all cases the odds ratios were in the expected directions; that is, as administrator turnover increased the association with the dependent variables increased. For example, a 10% increase in administrator turnover was associated with a 7% increase in the odds that a facility will have higher than average physical restraint use compared with lower than average. Among the control variables, ADLs, special care needs, FTE RNs and LPNs per resident, FTE nurse aides per resident, ownership, and private-pay census were consistently significant in the expected directions. As with the results for the chain facilities, staffing levels of nurses and nurse aides and for-profit ownership were particularly noteworthy. As staffing levels of RNs, LPNs and nurse aides increased, the association with the dependent variables decreased, whereas for-profit ownership was consistently associated with an increase in the dependent variables. Discussion Recent government reports indicate that 25% of the nation's nursing homes have serious quality problems that can harm residents; moreover 40% of these facilities are consistently of poor quality (GAO 1998   , GAO 1999a   , GAO 1999b   , GAO 1999c   ). Clearly, there is a need to improve the quality of nursing home care. Numerous public and private entities are actively involved in this improvement process. Recent developments include using total quality management, outcomes information, and best practices (Mukamel 1997   ). Legislation, such as the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA) may also influence the quality of nursing home care. To date, many of these initiatives have ignored the impact top management may have on quality. I believe this study provides preliminary evidence that the turnover of administrators in nursing homes may have an important effect on the quality of care.Because of administrators' potential influence on resident care, Kurowski and Shaughnessy 1985    suggest that management is likely to be important in accounting for outcomes. Singh and Schwab 1998    stated that high administrative turnover may have a "destabilizing influence" (p. 310). But in the long-term care literature I identified few studies using administrators as the focus of analysis (c.f., Angelelli, Gifford, Petrisek, and Mor 2001   ; Singh and Schwab 1998   , Singh and Schwab 2000   ). This paucity of research regarding the top management in nursing homes is surprising given that top managers are very frequently the focus of analysis in the management literature.In one of the few studies addressing turnover of administrators in nursing homes, Singh and Schwab 1998    determined the annual turnover rate to be 40%. Although I used a larger sample, my finding of an average annual turnover rate of 43% is consistent with the findings of this previous study. It is also worth noting that Singh and Schwab determined that in 6.5% of facilities two administrator changes occurred within 1 year. My study results are again close to this finding. I found 9% of facilities to have an average of two administrator changes within 1 year.Expanding on the work of Christensen and Beaver 1996    and Singh and colleagues 1996   , I sought to examine the effects of administrator turnover on six quality-of-care outcomes. The analysis shows that in nursing homes belonging to chains administrator turnover is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs and with a higher than average number of quality-of-care related deficiencies. In nursing homes not belonging to chains I found that turnover of administrators is associated with a higher than average proportion of residents who were physically restrained, were catheterized, had pressure ulcers, and were given psychoactive drugs.Clearly, the results show some differences between chain and nonchain nursing homes. For example, turnover is more prevalent in chain facilities (45% vs. 41%). With only five dependent variables and a sample size of 420 facilities, I cannot accurately determine whether chain or nonchain affiliation is beneficial to nursing homes with regard to quality outcomes. The difference in administrator turnover between chain-affiliated and nonchain-affiliated nursing homes does, however, provide some evidence that management practices may be different in chains.An important consideration is the strength of the findings associated with administrator turnover. In all cases the effects I identify are small. For example, in chain facilities the largest effect identified is for psychoactive drug use, with a 10% increase in administrator turnover associated with a 9% increase in the odds of higher than average psychoactive drug use. In freestanding facilities the largest effects identified are for physical restraint use and psychoactive drug use. A 10% increase in administrator turnover is associated with a 7% increase in the odds of higher than average physical restraint use and a 7% increase in the odds of higher than average psychoactive drug use. Clearly, many other factors are more influential on quality of care than administrator turnover; but, I argue that overall these effects are important. Unlike many other factors that influence quality, administrator turnover has a pervasive influence. Administrator turnover is associated with all of the quality measures examined. For this reason I feel the results are important.Many of the control variables in the analyses were significant. The results for nurse staffing and for-profit ownership were noteworthy. Consistent with several recent studies, higher levels of nurse staffing were associated with better outcomes (IOM 2001   ). The literature examining the association between ownership status and quality outcomes is not consistent (Davis 1991   ), but in the analyses, for-profit status was clearly associated with worse outcomes.My dependent variable, turnover, may benefit from further refinement. In the analyses I present, respondents were asked for the number of administrators employed by the facility for the previous 5 years. I was concerned that some administrators would be unable to accurately answer for this period of time. However, additional analyses using a similar open-ended question, for which administrators determined the time frame during which they could accurately determine the previous number of administrators, produced similar results. Also, by using an annual average of 5 years of turnover data against the results of one cross-sectional OSCAR data set the results are probably most representative of the cumulative effects of administrator turnover. But, it should be noted that my choice of 5 years was arbitrary. Analyses using other time frames may be useful.The analyses of chain and nonchain nursing homes may also benefit from further refinement. As expected, I did find some differences between chain and nonchain facilities. However, these divisions could be improved. Facilities belonging to a chain may be either for profit or not for profit; they may also consist of just several facilities or several hundred. This is one area that could be explored in greater detail.By including five measures my approach might better capture the overall effect of administrator turnover on quality. However, other quality measures are often used in nursing homes, including resident satisfaction and other survey deficiencies; these should also be examined. For example, although previous research has used quality-of-care deficiencies (GAO 1999a   ), this measure consists of a count of only 19 of a total of 170 different deficiencies. The deficiencies I used are also not weighted in any way to reflect their seriousness.Two refinements may be useful in future studies of administrator turnover. First, administrators may turn over because they are high performers. As such, they may be promoted or sought by other facilities. Conversely, they may be terminated because of poor performance. The reasons for turnover, and whether these affect quality outcomes, should be examined in future research. However, when using this approach, research has to be careful with regard to what constitutes "performance," as financial measures rather than measures of resident outcomes may be most important in turnover (see Snow and Hrebiniak 1980   , for a discussion of performance). In this study, I did not account for the performance of administrators prior to turnover.The second refinement that may be useful in future studies of administrator turnover is distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary turnover. Others have noted potential problems in not distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary turnover (Gauci-Borda and Norman 1997   ). Although in nursing homes this is not necessarily problematic, in the Singh and Schwab 2000    study, 21 of 25 involuntary transfers were actually promotions.Despite these possible study refinements, I feel that from a quality-of-care perspective aggregate turnover is important. I was concerned with the effects of turnover on quality outcomes, irrespective of whether the turnover was voluntary or involuntary or for reasons of performance.I speculate that nursing home administrators may influence the quality of resident care, by influencing the organizational culture, by inefficient or efficient management practices, or through a combination of these factors. However, one drawback of this study is that I did not investigate how nursing home administrators influence the quality of nursing homes. This study also has other weaknesses.As with all of the OSCAR data in this study, data were collected from staff interviews and from reviews of resident records at one point in time. The collection of data in this way is limited in that the prevalence of factors may be under- or overestimated. However, this limitation is endemic to all cross-sectional research. With the cross-sectional data used it was also not possible to disentangle causal direction. I found an association between administrator turnover and quality outcomes, and believe administrator turnover may cause poor quality. However, I cannot discount the alternative possibility that this association is due to nursing homes with higher quality retaining nursing home administrators. Indeed, Singh and Schwab 2000    indicated that this may be the case.As noted when describing the OSCAR, these data are subject to some limitations and possible biases. As such, additional analyses using the minimum data set data when they become more widely available, and use of the accompanying quality indicators, would be beneficial (Zimmerman et al. 1995   ).Adjustments to the findings for making multiple comparisons may be warranted. For example, a Bonferroni correction in testing the significance of the results could be used (Kennedy 1992   ). On one hand, this would control for the possibility of overinterpretation of the results because of chance findings (Kennedy 1992   ). On the other hand, in relatively unexplored areas of research, not making adjustments for multiple comparisons may be preferable (Rothman 1990   ). This ensures researchers do not penalize themselves by missing findings of importance (Rothman 1990   ). Because I feel the relationship between administrator turnover and quality is unexplored, I chose the latter approach. However, it should be noted that if I had used a Bonferroni correction, four of my eight significant associations between administrator turnover and the quality measures would no longer be significant at the level of p ≤ .05. These nonsignificant findings would be for pressure ulcers and catheterization in  Table 2  and catheterization and restraint use in  Table 3  . Clearly, this has an important effect on the robustness of the results.The IOM estimated that more than half of the nursing homes in the United States provided low standards of care (IOM 1986   ). Although the NHRA addressed many quality issues, and the overall quality of nursing homes is believed to have increased (Atchterberg, van Campen, Pot, Kerkstra, and Ribbe 1999   ), there is still a need to improve understanding of how and why better outcomes are achieved in some nursing homes. This investigation serves to focus attention on nursing home administrators.In conclusion, the reasons for performance gaps in quality between nursing homes remain largely unexplained, but are of interest to the industry and policy makers. My findings add to the body of literature on quality in nursing homes. Clearly, there is a need to be careful in drawing conclusions from these cross-sectional analyses, but I believe this study provides preliminary evidence that the turnover of administrators of nursing homes may have an important influence in the quality of care. However, as with most research, several intriguing questions follow from this study. First, consideration may be given to the question of whether individual, organizational, and market characteristics affect the rate of turnover. Second, examining job satisfaction and pay may offer further insight into the mechanics of administrator turnover. Third, the effects of turnover may be nonlinear and should be examined in studies with a higher power than this one. For example, administrators with longer tenure may perform more poorly than they have in the past, because of emotional exhaustion, outdated skills, or lack of motivation. As such, turnover of some poorly performing administrators may actually improve quality of care. It may also be useful to examine what period of stability is needed to increase quality in a facility with prior high turnover, and whether the initial quality of a facility is important. Clearly, longitudinal data are needed to answer many of these questions.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose of the Study: Researchers have posited a depletion syndrome among older adults that resembles "depression without sadness." Disengagement-related theories such as socio-emotional selectivity and gerotranscendence also describe an adaptive narrowing of the older person's social world and decreasing investment in activities and social relationships. This study has dual goals of confirming the existence of a "Withdrawal/Apathy/[Lack of] Vigor" (WAV) dimension of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and exploring its properties for evidence that it may be descriptive of either depletion or disengagement-related change in older adults. Design and Methods: Data were obtained through a mailed survey of members 65 and older at a health maintenance organization. Respondents returned 327 completed surveys and 163 "decline" postcards. Principal-components analysis obtained a 6-item WAV factor for further analyses. Results and Implications: High endorsement rates for the items in WAV and its bivariate correlations with age and health problems suggest WAV may be congruent with disengagement or depletion and may lead to over-identification of depression in older adults. Interpretation of the GDS and similar measures may be improved by use of subscale scores and consideration of age and health status of the respondent.   Depletion ,  Depression ,  Disengagement theory ,  the Geriatric Depression Scale ,  Socioemotional selectivity Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThis article links two phenomena: One, developmental changes suggested by the disengagement theory of aging (Cumming and Henry 1961   ), the early and influential theory that stated there is a mutual social and affective withdrawal between the older adult and his or her social environment, and by disengagement's newer theoretical "cousins," socioemotional selectivity theory (Frederickson and Carstensen 1990   ; Carstensen 1992   ) and gerotranscendence (Tornstam 1989   , Tornstam 1997   , Tornstam 2000   ), which also describe the narrowing of the older person's social world and decreasing investment in activities that were important in younger years. The second phenomenon is a postulated subtype of geriatric depression that has been termed depletion, represented by an aggregation of items in measurement studies using well-known depression screening scales (Newmann, Engel, and Jensen 1991   ; Gallo, Anthony, and Muthen 1994   ). The current study looks specifically at a group of items on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Brink, Yesavage, Lum, Heersema, Adey, and Rose 1982   ) that compose a dimension of Withdrawal/Apathy and Lack of Vigor (WAV; Parmalee, Lawton, and Katz 1989   ), and how this dimension behaves in relation to other dimensions of the GDS and to health and demographic measures in a convenience sample of community-dwelling elderly adults. The goals of the study include confirmation of a WAV subscale of the GDS and exploration of the behavior of the subscale in light of disengagement-related and depletion theories. When Is Geriatric "Depression" Not Depression? Clinical diagnosis of late-life depression is complicated by its differential assessment from somatic illness, from grief, from normal changes associated with aging, and from dementia (e.g., Blazer 1989   ; Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, and Fischer 1991   ; Fogel and Fretwell 1985   ). Overdiagnosis of depression in older persons may lead to the prescription of unnecessary or inappropriate medications, labeling individuals with mental health diagnoses unnecessarily, wasting scarce and costly health and mental health resources, and disseminating inaccurate research results. In a controversial article in The Atlantic Monthly titled "Overselling Depression to the Old Folks," the late psychotherapist Stanley Jacobson, then age 70, asserted that mental health professionals have overemphasized the diagnosis of depression in older adults.Health professionals want to reduce the struggle of the old to an illness. They label it "depression," search for biological explanations of the "disease," and call the psychological, spiritual, and social aspects of the conflict mere "risk factors." Unfortunately, by colluding in the denial that the fact of our mortality is significant to our mental health in late life, they contribute more to the prevalence of depression than to its cure. (Jacobson 1995   , p. 48)Among the issues Jacobson referred to in his critique is the challenge of differentiating somatic symptoms that are due to physical illness or aging from those that represent depression. This difficulty means that an item on a depression screening scale may represent a symptom of depression, but it may alternatively be a "symptom" of old age. For example, a study of over 4500 adults concluded that a number of health and activity variables, including cognitive dysfunction, poorer health, reduced independent living skills, and less engagement in pleasant activities, were associated with both old age and depression (Lewinsohn et al. 1991   ). In addition, sleep disturbances and poor appetite are quite common in older people and have been found to be poor discriminators for clinical depression in this group (Dorfman, Lubben, Mayer-Oakes, et al. 1995   ).Lewinsohn and colleagues 1991    have also noted that certain symptoms of depression, such as lack of social interest and greater self-involvement, mirror attributes of "normal" older adults according to disengagement theory (Cumming and Henry 1961   ), the controversial theory that in its most well-known form was presented as a comprehensive theory of normal aging, and, by implication, a model of "successful" aging. Disengagement theory has been out of favor with gerontologists for over 3 decades (Achenbaum and Bengtson 1994   ; Marshall 1994   ), although a number of writers have acknowledged that disengagement seems to occur in some older persons (Neugarten 1968   ; Youmans 1969   ; Cath 1975   ; Hochschild 1975   ; Steinkamp and Kelly 1987   ). More recently, Johnson and Barer 1992    reported finding clear signs of disengagement in approximately 50% of their sample of community-dwelling adults aged 85 years and older. Two newer theories, socio-emotional selectivity and gerotranscendence, each also assert that losing interest in some activities, not wanting to go out, and the like, may be a part of normal aging, reflecting a natural increased comfort with being alone and having a slower pace of life. Socio-emotional selectivity posits that the older adult becomes gradually less interested in forging new relationships as the focus turns toward conservation of energy for prioritized activities and comfortable, reliable relationships (Carstensen 1992   ), and has found support in recent research (e.g., Potts 1997   ). In gerotranscendence, the disengagement that occurs is interpreted as a transcendence of physical frailties and materialist concerns; being alone with time to contemplate is found to be more appealing to the older person (Tornstam 2000   ).Another reason assessment of late-life depression is so complex lies in the difference between a clinical diagnostic method of identification of depression, requiring a certain duration of symptoms, level of functional impairment, and combination of symptoms to be classified as depressed, and a measurement approach, for example, use of a depression screening scale based on endorsement of symptoms that are added up to reach a depression score. Because they are relatively inexpensive and nonintrusive means to identify elders who may be suffering from depression, brief screening instruments for geriatric depression have received a great deal of attention in the medical and mental health literature and continue to gain in popularity (Blazer 1994   ; Brink et al. 1982   ; Burke, Nitcher, Roccaforte, and Wengel 1992   ; Koenig, Meador, Cohen, and Blazer 1992   ). Focusing on this issue, Newmann and associates (Newmann et al. 1991   ; Newmann, Klein, Jensen, and Essex 1996   ) found that diagnoses often differ between a clinical diagnostic approach and a measurement approach. The authors speculated that this may explain why the prevalence of major depressive disorder is found to be lower among older persons than for younger adults, whereas scores on standard screening scales of depressive symptomatology are often higher for older persons (Newmann et al. 1996   ).Newmann and her colleagues (1996) went on to identify two distinct symptom clusters in the elderly—those that strictly adhere to clinical diagnostic criteria, which they term "depression syndrome," and a unique cluster of symptoms normally associated with depression but without some of the criteria necessary for a depression diagnosis by the usual standards, which they call "depletion syndrome." Using factor analyses to identify loadings of particular symptoms onto the two syndromes, Newmann and colleagues 1996    reported that some symptoms are unique or nearly unique to each syndrome. Whereas both syndromes share the symptoms of low energy, feeling things are an effort, feeling blue, and trouble falling asleep, the depression syndrome includes feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and self-blame and crying easily. Loneliness, lack of interest, and lack of appetite load more strongly on the depletion syndrome. The depletion syndrome increased linearly with age in this study, whereas the depression syndrome did not.In another study, Gallo and colleagues 1994    found that older adults were less likely than younger adults to endorse items about feeling sad, blue, or, specifically, depressed, in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM; 3rd ed., rev. (American Psychiatric Association 1987   ) criteria for major depression, when they nevertheless endorsed other symptoms such as sleep difficulty, lack of hope, and thoughts of death. These authors concluded that this "depression without sadness," or "depletion syndrome" appears to fit a proportion of their sample (Gallo et al. 1994   .) It is interesting that the same term was used 20 years earlier in a critique of disengagement theory, in which Cath 1975    discussed the apparent similarity of disengagement to depression in older persons and described a kind of combination of the two by the term, "normal depletion … something which will occur if one but lives long enough" (p. 212). Fogel and Fretwell 1985    posited the same term, "depletion syndrome," to describe the depression of medically ill elderly persons whose symptoms do not fit neatly into the usual symptom clusters for younger persons. The empirical difference in symptoms noted by all of these researchers raises the question: Are the majority of these older adults who endorse some of the purported depressive symptoms other than sadness actually depressed, or is there a different category into which we should be placing them?In light of the convergence of several theories of aging with a distinct response pattern found on depression screening scales described in the literature, the present study examined a group of "symptoms" from the GDS that may be normal for older adults. The items in question comprise two dimensions, Withdrawal/Apathy and Vigor, identified in a principal components analysis (PCA) of the scale (Parmalee, Lawton, and Katz 1989   ). Three of these items were also featured in another study using the short form of the GDS (GDS–S; Sheikh and Yesavage 1986   ). These withdrawal items—low energy, lack of interest in going out, dropping activities and interests—had a relatively lower positive correlation with the other two factors in the shortened scale—Dysphoria and Life Satisfaction—than they did with one another (Mitchell, Mathews, and Yesavage 1993   ). The authors interpreted this lower correlation between factors to be indicative of clearly distinct dimensions of depression for older adults (Mitchell et al. 1993   ).The current study sought first to replicate the existence of a WAV dimension in the GDS in an independent sample of community-dwelling elders. Then, the endorsement rates and relationship of GDS factor scores to one another and to selected demographic and health characteristics were examined. Because the WAV items were hypothesized to reflect developmental change associated with age, their endorsement rates in a relatively well, high-functioning group of older adults were expected to be higher than those of the Dysphoria items. It was also anticipated that the WAV score would have a higher direct correlation with age than would the Dysphoria score from the GDS. We further hypothesized that WAV items contribute disproportionately to the identification of depression in this sample when using the score of 11 or above as a cut-off. A final goal for this study was to explore the WAV items in light of the above theories of aging and depletion. We reasoned that if WAV represents a depletion syndrome, then its score should be associated with health conditions and functional impairment as well as age. If WAV represents socio-emotional selectivity and gerotranscendence, then one would expect less association with dysphoria, anxiety, or stress, as well as positive association with age. Method Participants Data for the study were obtained from a survey administered by mail to members over the age of 65 of a health maintenance organization (HMO) headquartered in Columbia, Maryland. Administrative personnel at the HMO made a random selection of 1000 out of the approximately 5000 available Medicare First members proportionate to the membership of three branches, Columbia, Annapolis, and Frederick, Maryland, assuring a good distribution across suburban, small urban, and rural locations. Members with recorded diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease or other primary dementias, mental retardation, or schizophrenia were screened out prior to selection. Measures The questionnaire for the survey was developed from a selection of scaled measures with the addition of demographic and health questions written specifically for the study. The final mailing included the questionnaire booklet; cover letters from the University of Maryland and from the HMO's Department of Psychiatry; a stamped return envelope; and a "decline" postcard, also postage paid, to be returned if the respondent did not wish to participate in the study. The cover letter offered completers of the questionnaire $5.00 cash on receipt of their materials. Unfortunately, no follow-up mailings could be sent. Some of the scaled measures included in the questionnaire were as follows: The GDS. The GDS (Brink et al. 1982   ), a 30-item self-rating scale, was developed specifically to screen older individuals for depressive symptoms and to correct some of the problems that researchers working with older persons had found with the existing depression scales up to that point (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, et al. 1983   ). For example, some of the well-known depression screening instruments, notably the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS; Zung 1965   ) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Depression Scale, tend to overdiagnose depression with elderly respondents because they include many questions about physical symptoms (Blazer and Williams 1980   ; Brink et al. 1982   ). Thus, the GDS was written with much less emphasis on somatic complaints. In addition, most of the existing scales, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff 1977   ), the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, and Erbaugh 1961   ) and the Zung SDS, use a Likert response system with three or more anchor points in answer to each question. This response format has been found to be confusing to a proportion of aged individuals, who, whether from mild dementia or the effects of depression, appear to misunderstand it (Yesavage et al. 1983   ), or to perseverate on the worst response, artificially elevating scores (Lyons, Strain, Hammer, Ackerman, and Fulop 1989   ). The GDS was created using "yes/no" questions to reduce the problem of too many choices and to make the scale as simple as possible for self-rating (Brink et al. 1982   ; Yesavage et al. 1983   ). Finally, the GDS was written to maximize its acceptability to older adults in the cohort of the times, who were found to react negatively to questions about sexual interest or suicidal ideation on general depression scales (Yesavage et al. 1983   ).The GDS has continued to gain prominence and acceptance in the gerontology literature. For example, it has been recommended as a standard instrument for research on depression in older adults to facilitate comparison and replication of studies (Koder, Brodaty, and Anstey 1996   ). The GDS is also included as part of the Geriatric Review Syllabus curriculum for geriatric medicine (Beck 1991   ). On the other hand, the GDS has received criticism for its simple dichotomous responses (Blazer 1994   ) and, depending on the sample characteristics, for obtaining lower than desirable sensitivity (Parmalee et al. 1989   ), specificity (Blazer 1994   ), or both (Koenig et al. 1992   ; Kafonek, Ettinger, Roca, Kittner, Taylor, and German 1989   ). In addition, Norris and Woehr 1998    item analysis of the GDS with a sample of 69 elderly medical patients obtained four item-to-scale correlations in their study that were quite low (two below .3, and two below .4), suggesting these items are not adequately related to the scale. Kafonek, Ettinger, Roca, and colleagues (1989) have noted that some GDS items "lack face validity" for older persons who have recently entered a long-term care facility, such as the item about giving up one's activities and interests. Additionally, despite the fact that the GDS avoids reference to purely somatic complaints, there are several items that appear to be susceptible to somatic conditions (Koenig et al. 1992   ).Using the 30 items as a single additive scale with one point each for "depressed" responses, there are two cut-off scores for the GDS to distinguish depressed from nondepressed respondents. Brink and colleagues 1982    recommended the use of 11 points and above to designate depressed as the most conservative cut-off, with an obtained sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 95%, a determination based on responses of a sample of 20 nondepressed elderly persons and 51 who were receiving treatment for depression (Brink et al. 1982   ). Nevertheless, use of a 14-point cut-off has also been reported (Kafonek et al. 1989   ; Lyons et al. 1989   ). Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Among noninstitutional elderly persons, it is appropriate to measure the degree of impairment in those everyday activities that go beyond self-care to functioning in and out of the home, referred to as IADLs (Lawton and Brody 1969   ). IADLs can be considered a rough measure of global physical and cognitive functioning. The measure of IADLs used here was taken from the Duke University Older Adults Multidimensional Assessment (OARS; The Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ) study, a measure that has been used numerous times in large and small studies of older adults. The OARS IADL scale consists of seven items, rated as needing no help (2 points), needing some help (1 point), or being unable to do the item (zero). The summed score, therefore, reflects higher capabilities for higher scores. Sense of Control. The degree to which individuals feel they have some control, whether over their everyday life or over their health and health care, has been shown to be an important predictor of health and mental health outcomes. Internal or external locus of control can be formally measured, but scales for doing so are lengthy and complicated. In contrast, a one-item measure of perceived control for this study, taken from Menec, Chipperfield, and Perry 1999   , has been found to predict adjustment to illness in prior research, and was related to health and functional disability status in their study. The question reads: "Thinking about life in general, some people generally feel out of control and helpless, while others feel in control and able to cope. How do you generally feel?" with a 0-to-10 rating. Lubben Social Network Scale. A brief scale assessing the respondent's living situation, contacts with friends and family, and the number of each that they feel close to, are able to confide in, and receive help from, the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS; Lubben 1988   ) consists of 10 questions scored from 0 to 5. The scale was developed to be used as a screening instrument in health settings, under the widely supported assumption that social support and social networks provide a benefit to elders' mental and physical health and recovery from health problems (Lubben 1988   ). Scores range from 0 to 50, with higher points indicating more social contact. A score of 20 or lower is considered to place an older person at risk for social isolation associated with extended hospital stays. Results Accounting for surveys returned for wrong addresses, 990 surveys were sent, from which 327 (33.0%) completed surveys and 163 (16.5%) decline postcards were returned, or a total response rate of 49.5%. The 327 completers were approximately the same age as the 663 combined nonresponders and decliners, (M = 73.2, SD = 6.2 years vs. M = 73.65, SD = 7 years, respectively) but completers were disproportionately male (48.3% of the completers were male vs. 41.0% of those who did not respond or declined). Completed surveys were checked against the original mailing list, and in two cases the spouse of the designated respondent was found to have answered the survey. These proxy responses were retained in the sample.Descriptive information on the sample is presented in  Table 1  . Of those who responded, 88.3% were Caucasian (8.9% were African American) with an age range of 65 to 94 and an average age of 73.2 years (SD = 6.2 years). About two thirds of the sample, 212 persons, were from 65 to 74 years old (the "young old") whereas 115 were 75 and over (the "older old"). The majority of respondents were Protestant (55.5%), had a spouse or steady partner (68.8%), and had at least one living child or stepchild (93.6%). Fourteen percent reported that they live in the same household with one of their children, 53.0% reported that at least one child lived within 5 miles, and only 12.2% reported the nearest child lived over an hour away.Educational attainment was distributed across levels, with about 16% having less than a high school diploma, 45.2% being high school graduates, 22.1% having a college degree, and 16.5% having some graduate work or an advanced degree, or cumulatively 83.8% with at least a high school diploma and 38.5% with at least a college degree. The sample was primarily retired (76.1%), but 12.2% reported working part time, 4.0% were working full time, and another 4.0% reported being disabled. Yearly income was indicated in $10,000 ranges and distribution was fairly even with 12% to 16% of respondents reporting incomes at each step from $10,000 to $60,000. Seven percent reported income below $10,000 and 16% reported incomes above $60,000, with the median falling within the $30,000 to $39,000 range. Health and Functioning. Respondents were asked to check off whether or not they currently suffered from a list of chronic health conditions. Most indicated two (31.5%) or one (26.6%) of these conditions. The mean number of conditions was 2.1. Among these, "arthritis that causes pain or limits activities" received the highest endorsement indicated by 45.3% of the sample. High blood pressure affected 44.3% of the sample. Heart disease received 22.9% endorsement and diabetes received 16.5%. Fewer indicated problems with emphysema or other breathing disorder (11.0%), depression (8.3%), anxiety or nerves (7.3%), and cancer (6.4%). Very small numbers, from 1% to 3%, endorsed effects of a stroke, history of alcoholism, Parkinson's disease, or liver disease.General health-related problems that were listed separately included the experience of pain that is significant (endorsed by 25.1%), early morning wakening (18.1%), difficulty falling asleep (15.6%), failing eyesight that causes difficulty reading or driving (12.5%), and hearing difficulties (10.7%).The sample rated their health from poor to excellent. The mean rating was 3.15, or a little above the "good" rating of 3.0. Only 25.1% of this community-dwelling sample rated themselves to be in "fair" or "poor" health. Forty-five percent indicated they visited a doctor from three to six times in the past year, whereas 43% said they saw a doctor seven or more times in the year. The remaining 12% said they saw the doctor never, once, or twice during the year.There was little variance within the sample on the IADL scale. The majority of respondents (64.0%) reported not needing help with any of the activities. Twenty-six percent reported needing help with one, two, or three IADLs. Only 10% required help with four to seven of the activities. Housework was the most highly endorsed IADL with which respondents required help, followed by preparing meals, then shopping, and going places independently. Social and Mental Health. Responses to the one-item sense of control question were highly skewed toward the "in control" end of the range from 0 (out of control) to 10 (completely in control). The median rating was 8. Only 10 respondents indicated they felt less in control than the midpoint; 26 (8%) placed their answer at the midpoint, neither in control nor out of control; and the remaining 89% placed their response as more in control than out of control.LSNS scores in this sample ranged from a low of 9 points to a high of 47. Cronbach's alpha for this sample (N = 306 with complete data) was .6824, and 35 respondents (10.7%) scored in the at-risk range for social isolation.Full-scale scores on the GDS were available for 272 out of the 327 respondents. Most of the 14.4% of the sample with missing data on the scale had one or two items missing. An average of 7.2 cases had missing data per item. Cases were retained for all areas in which their data were complete. Mean GDS score for the nonmissing sample was 4.92, with a range from 0 to 26 (where 30 is the maximum possible on the scale). Using the recommended cut-off of 0 to 10 for not depressed and 11 or above as suggestive of depression, 35 of the complete cases (12.9%) fell into the depressed category, whereas 87.1% were nondepressed. Using the more stringent cut-off of 0 to 13 versus 14 or above, 21 persons (7.7%) would be considered depressed. Cronbach's alpha was .8674 for the full scale for the 272 respondents in this sample.A PCA was performed on the GDS with the nonmissing sample to ascertain whether it would be appropriate to use the subscales from Parmalee and colleagues 1989   . Two subsets of GDS items from their PCA are of particular interest in this study, the 14-item Dysphoria factor and the Withdrawal/Apathy/[Lack of] Vigor factors with a total of seven items. A PCA with Pearson's r correlation matrices was used, as results have been shown to be nearly identical to those using the ideal polychoric type for dichotomous items (Liang 1984   ; cited in Parmalee et al. 1989   ). This PCA on the GDS resulted in nine eigenvalues over 1, but Cattell's scree plot suggested a final solution of six components. Varimax rotation converged in nine iterations.PCA items and their factor loadings appear in  Table 2  . The PCA explains 50.4% of the variance in the items. The first and fifth factors together comprise 13 of the 14 items of the Dysphoria factor in the Parmalee et al. 1989    analysis. (The omitted item is No. 27, "Enjoy getting up in the morning.") Because the first and fifth factors both relate to depressive affect, and they have a sufficiently robust Cronbach's alpha reliability in this sample (r = .8360), they were combined into this 13-item Dysphoria score for further analyses. The second factor in the PCA for this sample consists of six of the seven items that formed the Withdrawal/Apathy and Vigor factors in the Parmalee and colleagues study. The WAV items are: "Have you dropped many of your activities and interests?";"Do you prefer to stay at home, rather than going out and doing new things?"; "Do you find life very exciting?"; "Is it hard for you to get started on new projects?"; "Do you feel full of energy?"; and "Do you prefer to avoid social gatherings?". The missing item, "Mind as clear as it used to be," appears to relate less to disengagement from activities or interests than to trouble with memory or concentration. The six WAV items obtained Cronbach's alpha reliability of .7456, and are used as the WAV variable in further analyses. The third factor here consisting of four items relating to worry is an Anxiety factor (r = .6352). The fourth factor in this PCA is Mental Impairment (r = .6880). Three remaining items comprise an unreliable sixth factor, that might be called Agitation (r = .2723).Mean WAV score for the complete cases was 2.17 (SD = 1.87, n = 306); mean for the 13-item Dysphoria score was significantly lower at 1.08 (SD = 2.07, n = 304; paired samples t (288) = 8.517, p < .001, n = 289). Mean Mental Impairment (0.9650, SD = 1.19) and Anxiety (0.4207, SD = 0.8400) subscales were lower still. Table 3  displays the 30 GDS items, in descending order of their endorsement rates in this sample—that is, the percentage of respondents who answered the item in the depressed direction. Factor assignments are indicated with the initial after the item number (W = WAV, D = Dysphoria, A = Anxiety and M = Mental Impairment; there are 3 unassigned items). Item-to-total correlations are given in the far right column. The six WAV items had acceptable item-to-scale correlations, ranging from .3655 to .5848. The seven most highly endorsed items on the scale in the depressed direction were the six WAV items and No. 30, the "Mind as clear as it used to be" item that was grouped with these items by Parmalee and colleagues, 1989. The WAV items ranged from 24.8% endorsement (80 respondents) for Item 28, "Do you prefer to avoid social gatherings?" to 58.5% endorsement (186 respondents) on Item 21, "Do you feel full of energy?" One quarter to over one half of the respondents answered in the depressed direction on each of the WAV items. Of the 13 least endorsed items, 11 were from Dysphoria and 2 from the Anxiety subscale.Another way to look at endorsement is to compare the proportion of the sample that had no score in the depressed direction on each subscale. Two thirds of the sample (62.2%, n = 304) received zero score out of the possible 13 items in Dysphoria. Three quarters (74.1%, n = 309) received no score on the four-item Anxiety subscale and about half (48.4%, n = 314) on the Mental Impairment subscale. In contrast, not quite one quarter of the sample (24.8%, n = 306) received a score of zero on the six-item WAV subscale.The absolute value and the significance level of the intercorrelations among the four main subscales of the GDS in this sample are shown in  Table 4  . The correlation between the Withdrawal/Apathy/Vigor score and Dysphoria score was found to be moderately high, positive, and significant (r = .448, p < .001). The correlation between Anxiety and Dysphoria is higher in value than that between Anxiety and WAV, although both are significant and in a positive direction.Direct correlations of the GDS subscale scores with major study variables were also compared (see  Table 5  ). Several minor differences in the correlations to variables between WAV and Dysphoria are seen. For example, although all of the correlations are significant, WAV has a slightly higher absolute correlation to self-rating of health, number of health conditions, IADL, and income variables, and slightly lower correlation to self-report of a current depression condition and sense of control. WAV has a nonsignificant association with gender, whereas Dysphoria is significantly associated with female gender.Age in years is associated with GDS WAV (r = .263, p < .001), but not with GDS Dysphoria (r = .050, ns). To further underscore the differences in how age relates to the two subscales, we conducted an independent-samples t test on mean scores of these two GDS subscales for the young-old group of those 65 to 74 years old (n = 201) versus the older-old group of those 75 to 94 years old (n = 103). For GDS Dysphoria, there was a nonsignificant difference between the two age groups (t = −1.318, p = .188), whereas for WAV, the older group's mean score was significantly higher (t = −4.564, p < .001).Another question was how the WAV factor affects "case identification" in the GDS. Without the six WAV items, it was anticipated that fewer respondents would be classified as depressed. Using endorsement of up to one third of the responses for the nondepressed cut-off (0–10), I found that the prorated normal range for the 24-item scale without WAV items was 0 to 8 points out of 24. Removing the WAV items and prorating the scoring criteria did not affect the number of persons originally identified as not depressed by the full-scale score, but the cross-tabulation analysis in  Table 6  shows that without the six WAV items, only 22 persons, 8.1% of the sample, would have scores in the new, prorated "depressed" range of 9 to 24 points, compared with the 35 persons, 12.9% of the sample, who scored in the depressed range using the full-scale GDS score. Thus, WAV items were responsible for approximately 37% (13 out of the 35) of those identified as depressed by the full-scale score. Further analysis revealed that 6 of these 13 individuals were from the young-old category and 7 were from the older old category. Discussion External validity in this study is limited by the relatively low response rate from a predominately Caucasian and middle-class sample of elders from a single region of Maryland. Potential response bias cannot be ruled out with regard to key study variables, although it is known those who replied to the mail survey were approximately the same average age as nonresponders or decliners, and a higher proportion of the latter were female. Nevertheless, results of a PCA, endorsement rates and correlations based on responses from this relatively high-functioning sample add to our knowledge of the performance of specific items and groups of items on the GDS and their possible reinterpretation according to several related theories of aging.This study supports earlier findings that the GDS, originally presented and frequently used as a unidimensional measure, encompasses several subscales. The endorsement rates differed markedly between two subscales of the GDS examined here, suggesting that one set of items, those representing Withdrawal, Apathy, and Lack of Vigor (WAV), are more commonly experienced in this sample of community-dwelling elders. Unlike a calculation of hit rates using the scale score and cut-off as a benchmark against which to compare the performance of each item, or item-to-total correlations that use responses from all the scale's other items, simple item endorsement rates are not influenced by the answers to the other items on the scale. Thus, despite a positive correlation between the WAV and Dysphoria subscales, the difference in endorsement rates and mean subscale scores of the two tells us that low energy, having difficulty starting new projects, and so on are experienced more frequently than sadness, crying, hopelessness, and the like. In fact, subscale scores for WAV showed that only 25% of the sample did not have any WAV score, a lower proportion than that for Dysphoria or the other subscales.Behaviors and feelings similar to those in the WAV items are described in the disengagement theory of aging, socio-emotional selectivity, and gerotranscendence theories and in work by Newmann 1989   , Newmann and colleagues 1991   , Newmann and colleagues 1996    and Gallo, Anthony and Muthen 1994   , whose "depletion syndrome" differs somewhat from clinical depression in symptom configuration, a constellation of behaviors not identical with the GDS WAV, but with some overlap. In the present study, the number of WAV items endorsed has a significant association with increasing age, as does the depletion syndrome in Newmann and colleagues 1996   , whereas the Dysphoria subscale score is unrelated to age. Slight differences in bivariate correlations in which the correlations with health and functioning variables are stronger with WAV than with Dysphoria are also suggestive. WAV's intercorrelation with the GDS Anxiety subscale is also somewhat lower than that of Dysphoria, whereas its relation to the Mental Impairment subscale is somewhat higher. These findings taken together may be cautiously interpreted as suggesting that endorsement of WAV items could be tapping a disengagement-like or depletion condition, something that may naturally occur in elders, particularly those over 75 or in poor health, rather than a mental disorder such as depression. We may speculate that this condition represents the psychological and social adaptations to the physical and perhaps cognitive decrements that eventually come with advancing age.The six WAV items, one fifth of those on the scale, have contributed disproportionately to the total GDS depression score, pushing 37% of those who were classified as depressed by the total scale over the 10-point cut-off. Without the WAV items, 8.1% of the sample would be categorized as depressed, instead of the 12.9% who were classified as depressed with the full scale. On the GDS, each item counts uniformly as one point toward the depressed category, whereas by another diagnostic method such as the DSM–IV, certain key symptoms are "required" for a depression diagnosis and others merely tend to covary with the required symptoms. The WAV items appear to fall in the latter category of symptoms—they may accompany depression, but they also may be due to illness, extreme old age, or a depletion–disengagement syndrome due to changes and losses of old age. Unfortunately, equal weighting of the items on the GDS and similar screening scales may give clinicians and researchers who use the scale the impression that each item describes an equally important symptom, perpetuating the idea that older persons' development and depression profiles differ little from those of younger adults.As Stanley Jacobson 1995    wrote in his article on overselling depression, it is wise to evaluate an older person's mood and affect carefully before labeling or medicating him or her for depression. "Depression without sadness," on second look, may be socio-emotional selectivity or gerotranscendence—effects of "normal" aging and ways to cope with those effects. If practitioners and researchers choose to use depression screening scales such as the GDS, their validity may be improved by examining reliable subscale scores and concurrently considering the client's age and functional limitations. Although more work is needed, this article proposes a WAV subscale that appears to tap a unique dimension of the experience of older adults, thus adding to the information provided by a total GDS score.It will be appropriate to continue to explore this relationship of depletion, depression, and developmental changes of old age and further refine their definitions and measurement. Theories of aging, both new and old, should guide us in this effort.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1. Description of the Sample  View Large Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC), a symptom and quality-of-life inventory, was developed among community-dwelling adults under age 65. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and validity of an interview format of the PAC for older adults residing in long-term care. Design and Methods: The PAC was administered to 24 nursing home residents aged 65 and older. Cognitive interviewing methods were used to evaluate subjects' understanding and interpretation of PAC items. Results: The PAC interview required an average of 11 min, 15 s, to complete. Administration modifications for this population included rereading Likert anchor points and the stem question for each item. Subject item interpretation was generally accurate, as was interpretation of Likert anchors. Implications: The PAC is easily administered and well understood by older adult residents in long-term care and provides a brief method for obtaining constipation-specific symptom and quality-of-life data from this population.   Questionnaire feasibility ,  Constipation ,  Frail elderly persons ,  Think-aloud approach ,  Cognitive debriefing Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhD Introduction Constipation is a prevalent disorder and can result in quality-of-life (QOL) disruptions for the sufferer (Glia and Lindberg 1997   ; O'Keefe, Talley, Zinsmeister, and Jacobsen 1995   ; Schaefer and Cheskin 1998   ). Definitions of constipation vary widely, and therefore true prevalence estimates are difficult to compare across studies (Lederle 1995   ). However, there is consensus that prevalence of constipation increases with age; up to 40% of individuals aged 65 or older report constipation problems (Stewart, Moore, Marks, and Hale 1992   ; Talley, Fleming, Evans, O'Keefe, et al. 1996   ). Among frail community-dwelling older adults, 45% mentioned constipation as a concern and 11% considered it a major health problem (Wolfsen and Barker 1993   ). Prevalence of constipation is even higher among long-term care residents: up to 50% by some estimates (Alessi and Henderson 1988   ; Harari, Gurwitz, Avorn, Choodnovskiy, and Minaker 1994   ; Williams and DiPalma 1990   ) and more than 80% by others (Donald, Smith, Cruikshank, Elton, and Stoddart 1985   ; Read, Celik, and Katsinelos 1995   ).Causes of constipation for older adults may include medications, reduced caloric intake, lack of mobility, and ignoring the urge to defecate due to inconvenience or incapacity (Alessi and Henderson 1988   ; Donald et al. 1985   ; Read et al. 1995   ; Romero, Evans, Fleming, and Phillips 1996   ; Talley et al. 1996   ; Towers et al. 1994   ). Treatments generally involve laxatives (Petticrew, Watt, and Brand 1999   ). Increased fluid and fiber intake and increased activity may also be recommended (Read et al. 1995   ).Most current clinical definitions of constipation are based on a measure of frequency of defecation, alone or in combination with other symptoms such as discomfort or straining to defecate (Schaefer and Cheskin 1998   ). Stool frequency alone is not generally used for diagnosis because of its poor correlation with objective measures (Ashraf, Park, Lof, and Quigley 1996   ; Koch, Voderholzer, Klauser, and Muller-Lissner 1997   ). In their review of the literature on constipation in elderly persons, Harari, Gurwitz, and Minaker 1993    found that subjective complaints of constipation increase with age, as does laxative use, but clinical constipation may not. Among community-dwelling older adults, constipation symptoms are common, although bowel frequency may be similar to younger adults; radiographically diagnosed constipation was found in fewer than half of those with symptoms (Donald et al. 1985   ). For older adults, Harari, Gurwitz, Avorn, Bohn, and Minaker 1997    found that straining and hard stools correlated with self-report of constipation; frequency of less than two per week was not strongly associated with self-report of constipation. High interindividual variation complicates diagnosis by objective criteria (Floch and Wald 1994   ).To assist in diagnosis, the Rome criteria (Thompson, Creed, Drossman, Heaton, and Mazzacca 1992   ) were developed to provide clinicians with guidelines for the diagnosis of constipation. The Rome criteria specify constipation as fewer than two stools per week or two or more of the following: straining with at least 25% of bowel movements, feeling of incomplete evacuation after at least 25% of bowel movements, or hard stools at least 25% of the time. Although it is possible to obtain clinically objective measures such as colon transit time, creation and adoption of the Rome criteria are notable for their focus on patient symptoms. Multiple studies have documented the differences between patients and clinicians in terms of defining constipation (e.g., Herz et al. 1996   ).Increasingly, the patient experience of symptoms and condition-specific quality of life are recognized as unique sources of input that can enhance measurement of disorder effects and treatment outcomes (e.g., Moyer and Fendrick 1998   ). Several clinician rating scales exist (e.g., the Constipation Scoring System [Agachan, Chen, Pfeifer, Reissman, and Wexner 1996   ] and the Constipation Assessment Scale Constipation Assessment Scale [McMillan and Williams 1989   ). O'Keefe, Talley, Tangelos, and Zinsmeister 1992    developed the Bowel Symptom Questionnaire for the Elderly, and Osterberg, Grag, Karlbom, and Pahlman 1996    also developed a questionnaire, but neither of these is specific to constipation alone. The Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) was developed to provide a brief, easily administered measurement tool for symptoms and QOL aspects of constipation based on the patient's experience of the disorder. The PAC measure was designed to be able to capture both baseline disorder status and response to treatment. It was developed as an outcomes instrument suitable for evaluative research and assessment and designed to be valid and reliable for detecting change in clinical condition. On the basis of earlier validation studies with younger adults (Frank et al. 1999   ), we have evidence that PAC score change is consistently and meaningfully related to clinical condition change. Because of the rigorous instrument development work, the PAC can also be used in research settings to measure constipation symptoms and clinical course based on patient self-report. It consists of two separate scales, the PAC-SYM, a 12-item measure of symptom severity, and the PAC-QOL, a 28-item measure of the health-related quality of life associated with constipation. They were developed in tandem, and both demonstrate excellent psychometric properties in use among community-dwelling younger adults (Dubois, Johnson, de la Loge, and Marquis 1998   ; Frank, Kleinman, Farup, Taylor, and Miner 1999   ; Marquis, Dubois, Frank, and Rothman 2000   ). However, because these studies were conducted among community-dwelling adults generally under the age of 65, the usefulness of the PAC for older patient populations is unknown. A patient-based constipation assessment tool applicable to older adults in long-term care would be particularly valuable given the prevalence and serious sequelae of constipation among that population.The quality of questionnaire data obtained from older adults, particularly institutionalized older adults, may differ from that obtained from younger adults. For example, older adults may interpret items differently or have difficulty with memory involved in retrieving relevant information (Jobe and Mingay 1990   ; McHorney, Ware, Lu, and Sherbourne 1994   ). Also, West, Bondy, and Hutchinson 1991    have pointed out that physical, cognitive, affective, and personal factors may threaten the validity of interview data from institutionalized older adults. These findings have consequences for accurate and valid symptom and QOL measurement among institutionalized older adult populations, given that data quality is fundamental to establishing the reliability and validity of an instrument. The potential differences between younger and older adults in response to the same questionnaires create the need to closely examine the use of questionnaires with older adults, particularly for those developed and tested among younger adults as was the PAC.In addition, gerontology researchers have long recognized the unique concerns of older adults in nursing homes with regard to questionnaire administration. Accurate communication of questions and response choices is one key concern. To accommodate visual impairments among some subjects, font size of written materials is often increased. The mode of administration is another consideration. Some evidence suggests questionnaire items can be more successfully communicated to older adults through interviewer-administered rather than self-administered questionnaires (e.g., Coast, Peters, Richards, and Gunnell 1998   ).Understanding the ways in which subjects respond to items is a key step in evaluating a questionnaire. Thorough knowledge of the subjects' thought processes involved in responding ensures that the items are performing in the manner intended. A cognitive debriefing was included as a step in instrument development for the PAC, but because the PAC has not yet been used with older adults, no information is available about the older adults' thought processes in response to PAC items. For this study, the cognitive process model (Jobe and Mingay 1990   ; Warnecke et al. 1997   ) was used as a framework for interpretation of results from the cognitive debriefing. According to cognitive process theory, subjects perform four tasks when responding to a question: interpretation, memory retrieval, judgment formation, and response editing (Warnecke et al. 1997   ). In this way, we address the potential for "category fallacy," the incorrect assumption that item interpretation is the same for the group being tested as for the group from which the question was developed (Warnecke et al. 1997   ).The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and validity of the interview format for administration of the PAC to older adults residing in nursing homes. Specifically, the following attributes were examined: acceptability of items to subjects, acceptability of time to complete the questionnaire, extent of missing data, and ability of subjects to understand and answer the items (Coast et al. 1998   ; McHorney et al. 1994   ). Cognitive interviewing methodology, a set of qualitative research methods developed to improve questionnaires and surveys, was used to address the objective. Both the think-aloud approach and cognitive debriefing are part of cognitive interviewing methodology. Researchers involved in questionnaire design have long recognized that the wording of questions, the format of responses, and other aspects of questionnaires can be readily misunderstood or misinterpreted by some subjects, leading to inaccurate measurement. To help avoid these mistakes, subjects are asked to verbalize their thoughts (think aloud) as they answer the questionnaire. Cognitive debriefing involves probing techniques, in which researchers can ask subjects to further explain certain responses, either during administration of the questionnaire or following completion of it (Jobe and Mingay 1989   ; Willis 1994   ). These methods help to identify problems with the questionnaire that could limit the validity or reliability of subjects' responses. Methods Although the PAC was developed for self-administration, for institutionalized older adults in long-term care the PAC was modified to an interview format. On the basis of evidence of the excellent performance and clinical meaning of the 5-item Satisfaction subscale of the PAC-QOL (Marquis et al. 2000   ) and in an effort to minimize respondent burden, only this subscale from the PAC-QOL was included. The entire 12-item PAC-SYM was used.This study was approved by one central and four site-specific institutional review boards. The interviewer explained the study to eligible subjects and obtained written informed consent from subjects before beginning the interview. For subjects with legal guardians or for whom cognitive capacity was in question, the interviewer contacted the guardian or appropriate family member, provided copies of the informed consent form, and obtained written informed consent.Subjects were required to be 65 years of age or older, to be clinically stable, to be able to take oral medications and to use a toilet or bedside commode, to have the ability to reliably communicate symptoms as judged by nursing home staff, and to have a history of constipation, defined as use of a stimulant or osmotic laxative or enema at least once a week for the 4 weeks before the interview. Nursing home staff were asked to assist with the identification of individuals who met the eligibility criteria. The interviewer obtained background clinical and demographic data from the medical record and/or from nursing staff.This study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a pilot study to test and refine the interview methods. Five older adult subjects in long-term care were interviewed, using the PAC. For Phase 1, the recruiting nurse was asked to identify subjects likely to have the cognitive capacity to respond to a face-to-face interview about constipation.An interviewer read the PAC items while subjects looked at a large-font response option card during the interview. Subjects were asked to think aloud during the actual PAC interview, to obtain a record of their thinking during the process. At the completion of PAC administration, subjects were asked to respond to semistructured cognitive debriefing questions.The debriefing questions for this study were drawn from the cognitive debriefing process used in the development of the PAC-SYM and included special attention to subject interpretation of the Likert scale anchors and to specific item wording that was a concern in subject interpretation during PAC development. Debriefing questions were organized into the following sections: overall impressions, general instructions and recall period, items, meaning of item terms, and meaning of item anchors.On the basis of the pilot study, the interviewer was instructed to reorient the subject to the response options by rereading the Likert anchor points on the response option card for each item rather than allowing the subject to read the response option card in silence. The interviewer also reread the stem question for each item because the pilot study also indicated that this improved subject item understanding.In Phase 2, a total of 19 subjects were interviewed. Subjects were recruited from five nursing homes located in the northeastern United States. Three sites were nonprofit nursing homes of between 100 and 340 beds; two sites were for-profit nursing homes of between 175 and 300 beds. Because Phase 2 was the formal extension of the initial work and involved a larger sample and because multiple nurses were assisting with recruitment, assessment of cognitive status was formalized for Phase 2. Extent of cognitive impairment was rated by nursing staff or the interviewer, using a 5-point scale from none to severe. Subjects with cognitive impairment rated as none or minimal were selected for Phase 2.Data on some personal characteristics were also collected (race, education, prior occupation, and ethnic background). Diagnoses and patient self-rating of constipation severity (on a 7-point scale) were collected to understand the relationship of responses to physical factors. All Phase 2 interviews were conducted by a single interviewer.The interviewer read the PAC instructions to subjects and then asked the specified PAC questions, PAC-SYM first, PAC-QOL second. Acceptability of items, acceptability of time to complete, ability of subjects to understand the items, and questionnaire face validity (subject perceived relevance) were all examined through cognitive debriefing, as described above. During the PAC administration, subjects were asked to verbalize their thoughts as they completed each item, and their comments were recorded. At the completion of the PAC interview, subjects were asked semistructured questions about the questionnaire administration. The time to complete each PAC interview was measured, although those times are likely to be longer than for usual administration since they included time to "think aloud."All interviews took place in private, in the subject's room or in a quiet office or conference room. For all interviews, the lighting was good. At times there was slight background noise from other residents and staff. At no time was this disruptive to the interview. Results The 19 subjects ranged in age from 68 to 99, with length of stay in the nursing home ranging from 15 months to 15 years, 10 months. Length of stay for 9 subjects was between 2 and 5 years. All but 1 subject was Caucasian, all but 2 were female, and 15 were widowed. Thirteen of the 19 subjects noted their duration of constipation as a year or longer. Eight of the 19 subjects rated their constipation as mild (1 or 2 on a 7-point scale), and only 3 rated their constipation as severe (6 or 7). Characteristics of the sample are summarized in  Table 1  .Time for completion of the PAC-SYM was 4 min on average (range 2 to 10 min), and time for completion for the PAC-QOL was 7.25 min on average (range 2 to 10 min). Several subjects chatted at great length during the interview, leading to times for 4 subjects of 10 min or more. All completion times are inclusive of the think-aloud process. Quantitative Results Frequencies of item responses are presented in  Table 2  and  Table 3  for the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL, respectively. There were no missing data on the PAC-SYM. In general, subjects responded across the range of scale choices. Three subjects chose "absent" in response to all 12 PAC-SYM items. Of interest is the high proportion of patients responding "absent" to the items regarding rectal burning (17 of 19) and rectal tearing or bleeding (16 of 19).Four subjects did not respond to item 4 on the PAC-QOL, and many subjects had difficulty responding to this item, which concerned time required for digestion. PAC-QOL Item 5, concerning satisfaction with treatment, was also difficult for subjects to understand. In particular, the term treatment in the question caused confusion and appeared to be too broad for many subjects. Cognitive Debriefing and Think-Aloud Results Responses to the cognitive debriefing questions, asked after administration of the PAC, are summarized below. Overall Impressions. The first questions of the cognitive debriefing interview concerned content validity and comprehensiveness, ease of administration, and interview length. All 19 subjects reported that the interview asked the right questions (addressing relevance as perceived by the subject, or face validity). Three subjects had suggestions on other areas to ask about. One suggested asking "about blood more," one suggested asking about diet, and 1 subject suggested asking about laxatives.One subject mentioned that we did ask if subjects had to change their routine in response to constipation. (The daily routine was important to this subject, and a change in bowel habits caused a change in routine for this 1 subject). The interview was "moderately short" to 1 subject and the "questions simple." Another subject called the interview "very sensible." Just 1 subject noted it was difficult to complete and long. This same subject responded negatively in general to the entire interview, calling it "embarrassing." General Instructions and Recall Period. The next questions in the cognitive debriefing interview addressed whether the instructions were clear, if the subject limited recall to the prior week only, and if recall was difficult. The instructions were clear to the subjects: "nothing confusing," "fine," "clear as day." One subject said that the language was not in medical terms, which was good because she does not understand medical terms.In response to the question "Did you think about the past week only?" 7 of the 19 subjects said no. One of those 7 noted that she thought instead about "the whole thing, of course. What good is the past week?" Another noted that she "has the problems every day." Another said she "thought about all the time," and another replied she thought about "more than the past week." Two other subjects who said they did limit their thoughts to the past week (as instructed) had interesting comments in response to that question. One said, "Yes, [it was] difficult but [I] tried to continue." Another subject remarked that "one week doesn't seem to be enough time, maybe one month." Two other subjects remarked that they thought about one particular day with problems as they responded to the PAC-SYM. To determine if cognitive impairment could account for their different recall period, we examined the clinical and cognitive status variables for these subjects. There appeared to be no relationship among these subjects in terms of their self-rating of constipation severity (ranging from 1 [mild] to 5), their self-reported duration of constipation (ranging from less than 3 months to "all my life"), or their nurse-rated cognitive status (mild to minimal). Items. On the basis of results from our pilot testing with older adults in nursing homes for this project, the interviewer reread each response option following the reading of each item as a means of ensuring subject orientation to the response scale for each item. However, subjects would often interrupt the interviewer as she read their preferred response choice. For example, rather than letting her keep reading the response choices of "severe" and "very severe," the subject would reply "moderate" immediately after the interviewer read that as a response option. Per protocol, the interviewer continued to reread the response options anyway. All subjects heard the full set of response options read at least once. Most subjects appeared to understand the response options for the PAC-SYM; fewer subjects understood the response options for the PAC-QOL and thus asked the interviewer for clarification.The first three cognitive debriefing questions about the items were intended to determine if specific items were difficult to understand, what if any changes they would recommend, and whether they thought other subjects might have difficulty responding to some items. This last question allowed for elicitation of modification suggestions even if the subject him- or herself was unwilling to admit to difficulty with understanding.No subjects reported difficulty understanding any items themselves. Only 4 of the 19 subjects responded affirmatively to the question "Do you think certain questions will be hard for other people to understand?" (One of these was a subject who reacted negatively to most of the interview.) One noted that it may be "hard for people to remember if they had a problem." Another said, "It might be for some. Some people just don't understand." In general, however, subjects reported that the items were readily understandable. One said the questions were not difficult, it "just takes time to come up with the answer." Meaning of Item Terms. The next questions in the cognitive debriefing were meant to elicit the subjects' interpretation of the terms abdomen and stomach, specific terms used in the PAC. Use of these terms in gastrointestinal surveys has come under increased scrutiny, as researchers have noted that consistent interpretation of these terms across subjects is required for accurate interpretation of results from questionnaires in which they are used. Focus group results from the initial development of the PAC suggested that U.S. subjects may interpret these terms in different ways, potentially altering the intended symptom description. Eight subjects explicitly equated abdomen and stomach. Nine referred to the stomach as "where the food goes," "put food in it," "part of digestive tract," and similar responses. One of these subjects pointed to her waist to clarify her meaning for both terms. One subject identified the abdomen as below the stomach. Another noted that the "stomach was part of the abdomen," and another said she was "not sure of the difference." The remaining subjects did not provide a definition of either stomach or abdomen and appeared to not understand the point of the question. In general, subjects more readily offered definitions for stomach than for abdomen. The order in which the questions were asked (abdomen first) may have influenced results. In general, subjects' responses suggested accurate interpretation of the items.The next question was "Are rectal burning and painful bowel movement the same or different?" These terms were intended to represent distinct symptom sets. Eleven of the 19 subjects responded that they are different, with one noting that "painful bowel movement causes rectal burning." Six said they were the same or the "same classification," and 1 did not understand the point of the question. Another subject said, "I don't think about them" and provided no other answer.In response to the question "What does the word ‘regularity’ mean to you?" all 19 subjects responded with consistently similar answers (e.g., "going every day" or "daily"). The next question asked, "What does it mean to be satisfied with your treatment?" As with the prior question, the responses were generally consistent: "happy," "satisfied," "moderately happy," "meds are working; comes out without any trouble," "methods take care of problem," "happy, OK with what the doctors do," "they do something that works," "fine," and "if I need something I get it." One subject would not answer and appeared agitated and annoyed with cognitive interview questions 7 through 12. Another subject did not appear to understand and replied "be happy with people, but some people I can't stand." This same subject frequently mentioned her dislike of another resident throughout the interview, even in response to some of the questions, although the other resident was not in the room at any time during the interview. Meaning of Item Anchors. Subjects were asked to explain the meaning of the Likert scale anchor terms for mild to very severe. Three of the 19 subjects did not reply to the question at all, 2 of the subjects responded to only the first anchor question, and 1 responded only to the first and last anchor questions. Some expressed irritation at the questions about the meaning of the anchors. Of the 13 subjects who attempted responses to all anchor options, 7 presented explanations that indicated understanding of the ordinal nature of the scale. The other 6 presented answers that suggested increasing severity across options, but equated one or two adjacent response options. These results are similar to those obtained from pilot testing with 5 younger adults during initial development of the PAC-SYM, in which subject responses indicated an appropriate ordinal ranking of these anchors. None of the younger subjects equated response options, however; all were verbally distinguished.The next question asked subjects to describe the meaning of the PAC-QOL Likert anchors (not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, or extremely satisfied). As noted above, some of the cognitive debriefing questions asking subjects to define Likert anchor terms were annoying to subjects. Whereas a total of 5 of the 19 subjects did not respond or responded minimally to the same set of questions regarding the PAC-SYM scale anchors, 9 of the 19 subjects did not respond to the questions about the PAC-QOL anchors. Among those who responded, there was general understanding of the specific terms and of the progressive, ordinal nature of the scale. General Comments. Finally subjects were asked if they had any other comments on the interview. One said, "They give me enemas; you didn't ask me about enemas," and another said, "Very strange to have someone ask these questions; hard to measure; [I] don't think of constipation and satisfaction" (they don't go together in his mind). One subject No. (14) noted that the "categories were tough." Another subject (No. 15) noted that the questionnaire was "too general" but then said, "I don't know if you can get more specific … if you don't make it general you get problems too." Discussion The results of this study indicate that the PAC can be administered to institutionalized older adults by interview and that subjects found the items and the process generally acceptable. Time to complete the PAC was generally brief despite instructions to subjects to think aloud when formulating their responses; there were limited missing data, and the subjects demonstrated good understanding of the items.The relevance of constipation research assessment methods to long-term care residents is underscored by the high prevalence of constipation in the long-term care population as well as the high care costs associated with constipation in long-term care (Frank et al. 2000   ). Because the PAC has demonstrated reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change over time among community-dwelling adults (Frank et al. 1999   ), it should be of value to research and assessment for community-dwelling older adults as well. However, the PAC is not intended as a diagnostic tool, and although it might serve that function, more research would be required (i.e., comparison with clinician diagnosis) before its usefulness in diagnosis could be confirmed.The 1-week recall period may not be appropriate for this population. More than a third of subjects reported that their responses were based on a longer time frame or a more general impression instead. This differs from results from the pilot testing with younger adults, in which all subjects indicated that they limited their responses to the prior week.Several subjects reported no constipation symptoms based on responses to PAC-SYM items. Subjects were selected on the basis of presence of constipation (frequency and/or use of specific medications), and it is possible that their treatment regimens provided adequate symptom relief accounting for the apparent lack of current symptoms. Given the relatively low level of symptom severity of this sample as noted in the PAC-SYM, a slightly longer recall period may provide more of a symptom experience base from which to respond. The self-administered PAC was originally developed using a 2-week recall period to ensure occurrence of events to rate. Although that recall period was chosen in part to accommodate individuals with severe constipation and bowel movement frequencies of less than 2 per week, the same reasoning may apply to individuals with reasonably well-controlled constipation symptoms. The finding of low symptom severity among this sample is consistent with results from a study of 59 constipated residents in long-term care (Frank et al. 2000   ). In that study, all residents identified by nursing staff as suffering from constipation, were receiving symptomatic treatment for constipation, and therefore symptoms were minimal or absent for some subjects.The cognitive debriefing interview was designed to determine if subjects consistently interpreted the meaning of specific terms: stomach versus abdomen, rectal burning versus painful bowel movement, and regularity. Interpretation of stomach and abdomen and description of interpretation of the items regarding abdominal discomfort, pain, and bloating appeared to be consistent, as did interpretation of the item about stomach cramps. The corresponding symptom descriptions appear to have been interpreted as intended by the authors of the scale by these respondents (face valid). Having separate items for rectal burning and painful bowel movements appears justified; nearly two thirds of subjects explicitly stated these were distinct. Subjects readily understood and consistently interpreted the concept of bowel movement regularity.Consistent interpretation of the Likert response scales was another concern. When asked to explain the meaning of the response options, most subjects' responses indicated understanding of the ordinal nature of the scale. As noted above, most subjects appeared to understand the severity response options for PAC-SYM but found the response options for the satisfaction scale of the PAC-QOL more difficult.The cognitive process model has been invoked to examine the cognitive processes used by subjects to respond to questionnaire or survey items (Jobe and Mingay 1990   ; Warnecke et al. 1997   ). According to cognitive process theory, subjects perform four tasks when responding to a question: interpretation, memory retrieval, judgment formation, and response editing (Warnecke et al. 1997   ). Concepts of cross-cultural psychology apply to establishing measurement equivalence even across different demographic groups within a culture. To cross-cultural researchers, a category fallacy can result from the incorrect assumption that item interpretation is the same for the group being tested as for the group from which the question was developed (Warnecke et al. 1997   ).The cognitive debriefing questions were designed to illuminate the interpretation of questions. Consistent item interpretation is fundamental to the accuracy of data collected and interpretations based on those data. Results from this study suggest that the PAC instructions and most items were accurately interpreted by most subjects, and some form of ordinal scaling was implied by the subjects' responses about the Likert response options. There was less response in general to the question that asked for definitions of the PAC-QOL response options, and some subjects indicated problems with the "extremely" choice (Subject 13 said, "That's ridiculous," and Subject 15 said, "I'm rather dubious about that one"). As noted below, the English version of the response options for the PAC-QOL may need further consideration. Although psychometric performance of the PAC-QOL was evaluated and found acceptable in a U.S. population, some wording problems may remain as it was developed in a non-U.S. population. The PAC-QOL item regarding satisfaction with treatment caused confusion among subjects, in large part due to subject uncertainty about the meaning of the term treatment. In the context of a clinical trial or evaluation of a specific treatment regimen, this item may cause no difficulty, but clarification regarding what is meant by treatment may help ensure consistent interpretation of the item across subjects.The second task subjects must perform when responding to a question is memory retrieval. Cognitive process theory suggests that regularly occurring events are likely to be remembered as generalized schemas rather than as episodic discrete events. This point has direct relevance for the PAC recall period used with different patient populations. Clearly, this sample of older adults tended toward generalized schema memory, with many readily admitting that they did not limit their responses to the past week as instructed but instead recalled across longer time periods and, presumably, obtained a more general impression on which they based their responses. The length of the recall period for the PAC was originally set at 2 weeks to allow for sufficient occurrences of constipation-related events to permit rating. The "acute" 1-week version may result in more generalized schema recall among respondents, particularly if few constipation-related events occurred in the week prior. If this holds true, then the responsiveness of this instrument to change over time will be attenuated.The third task is judgment formation. Cognitive process theory suggests that episodic, discrete event recall is less subject to various aspects of cultural bias than general schema recall. If this is true, then encouraging respondents to truly focus on specific events in the prior week could improve data quality by minimizing the potential bias and distortion introduced by cultural influences on response (e.g., avoiding extremes on scales, modesty leading to severity minimization).The final task is response editing. Social desirability, a recognized threat to validity, may lead subjects to answer in the manner they think is expected of them. One subject even commented when asked if the interview was difficult to complete that she had a "good interviewer." In response to the question about the length of the interview, this same subject said, "Oh, I like talking to you. [The length] is just fine." These responses potentially indicate both the influence of loneliness and the related desire to please others and provide them what the subject thinks they want. The nursing home setting is likely to enhance these editing tendencies.The greater the response editing, the greater the bias introduced. As Warnecke and colleagues 1997    noted, editing is more likely when there is a cultural difference between the interviewer and respondent. The implication for this study is that the age of the interviewer may have affected the responses obtained. Our interviewer was 31 years old. More closely age-matched interviewers may elicit less editing, although for obtaining patient response to the actual questionnaires this sensitivity to interviewer age is probably not warranted. Further, nursing staff with whom nursing home residents interact frequently are younger than most residents themselves. There is no evidence to suggest that older nursing home residents edit responses to nursing staff regarding clinical issues. Although this is an interesting question for further consideration, accuracy of responses to the interviewer-administered PAC is unlikely to be dependent on interviewer age.Among the pieces of evidence identified to help with the evaluation of the suitability of an instrument is the extent of missing data (McHorney et al. 1994   ). It is therefore of interest that only two items had any missing data, PAC-QOL Items 2 and 4. Item 4 reads, "To what extent during the past week have you been satisfied with the time it takes for food to pass through the intestines?" Four subjects did not answer this, with 1 explicitly stating she could not. The interviewer noted, however, that many subjects appeared to have difficulty interpreting Item 4. Further exploration of the meaning of this item to subjects could be helpful.As noted above, some subjects expressed frustration at the rereading of all response choices with each item and with the repetitive nature of some cognitive debriefing questions. Because these subjects had little or no cognitive impairment, the rereading strategy established on the basis of the pilot study may have been annoying or insulting to them. In actual PAC administration, cognitive debriefing questions are not asked, but sensitivity to subject annoyance is prudent. Informing subjects that the interviewer will be reading each response choice repeatedly may be one way to improve patience with the practice. Alternatively, this practice could be modified depending on interviewer judgment of adequate patient orientation to the response choices, especially as all subjects are given printed copies during the interview.Keeping subjects on topic is also anecdotally a challenge when interviewing older adults. This may be particularly salient in a nursing home where interaction with other people is limited, making the interviewer a welcome "guest." Administration times for 4 of the subjects reflect this; these subjects became quite conversational during the PAC administration. While practical time considerations may require keeping the subject more tightly on track, allowing sufficient time for some conversation aids in establishing rapport and should be anticipated in an interview format administration with older adults. Discussion during the interview should be discouraged, however, as it can lead to inconsistent administration across subjects and therefore to bias.Use of an open-ended interview approach to the study of symptom and quality-of-life measures with older adults is supported by evidence from qualitative research (e.g., Lincoln and Guba 1985   , and Steckler, McLeroy, Goodman, Bird, and McCormick 1992   , as cited in MacEntee 1996   ). Our results are consistent with those of other researchers, who have demonstrated that the think-aloud and probe question approach are effective means of obtaining information to maximize data quality from older adults (Jobe and Mingay 1990   ).The results from this study suggest that the interviewer-administered PAC is feasible for use with institutionalized older adults. This study also suggests several avenues for future work. As results from use of the EuroQoL with older adults have suggested (Coast et al. 1998   ), comparison of self-administered and interviewer-administered results is essential to understanding the contribution of administration format to results. A direct comparison in this population may therefore yield additional insight about the use of the PAC. As Gregoire, de Leval, Mesters, and Czarka 1994   (p. 14) pointed out, questionnaire validation "is an endless process of accumulating evidence." Although the results from this study support the feasibility, acceptability, ease of administration, and intended interpretation of the PAC for this population, quantitative study of the psychometric properties of the PAC in this population, in comparison to the population on which it was first tested, could be illuminating. These qualitative results are the first step in the validation process for the population of older adults in long-term care.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose of the Study: The overall purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between widowed persons' baseline assessments of self-efficacy beliefs and their ratings of perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem obtained in an 18-month follow-up. Design and Method: At Time 1, a survey of sociodemographics, a multidimensional measure of global self-efficacy, and a domain-specific measure of self-efficacy, having eight subscales of self-efficacy (interpersonal, instrumental, emotional, social support, nutritional, physical, financial, and spiritual) were administered to a group of 231 widows and widowers to obtain baseline assessments of their self-efficacy beliefs. At Time 2, a follow-up of 211 widows and widowers was conducted to obtain their perceptions of health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and levels of self-esteem 24 months following spousal loss and to assess whether self-efficacy beliefs play a predictive role in widowed individuals' perceptions of their health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem. Results: A series of gender-specific multiple regression analyses models revealed that widows and widowers differ significantly with respect to the relationship between specific domains of self-efficacy and their perceived quality of life in the longer term following spousal loss. Implications: Implications of the findings are discussed for clinicians and health professionals working with bereaved spouses in terms of intervention programs for retraining of self-efficacy.   Predictors of perceived quality of life ,  Self-efficacy beliefs of widowed elderly ,  Predictors of well-being following spousal loss Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDWith more and more elderly persons living considerably longer after the death of a spouse (Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton 1990   ; Krause 1986   ; Mendes de Leon, Kasl, and Jacobs 1994   ), understanding the self-efficacy beliefs that are linked to perceived diminishment or maintenance of quality of life and life satisfactions following a period of spousal loss is becoming a critically important matter to gerontologists. Identifying social–cognitive beliefs of self-efficacy and sociodemographic factors that are predictive of men and women's heterogeneous perspectives of the quality of their lives and their life satisfactions following spousal loss is of increasing interest to clinicians, practitioners, and families concerned with assisting elderly individuals in maintaining a reasonable quality of life following widowhood (see discussions by Campbell and Silverman 1999   ; Lieberman 1996   ). Also of interest to practitioners is the way in which widows and widowers differ in self-efficacy beliefs in various domains of their interpersonal, social, emotional, and physical functioning, and how these differences may be related to their perceived quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem in the period following spousal loss (see Hansson, Remondet, and Galusha 1993   ; Lieberman 1996   , for full discussion). In keeping with this line of thinking, the purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which widowed individuals' preexisting self-efficacy beliefs (both global and domain specific) are predictive of their perceived quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem in the period following loss and to establish whether assessments of self-efficacy domains of men and women should be usefully included in any existing programs of self-care and coping with spousal loss (Pearlman and Uhlmann 1991   ). The Underlying Theoretical Model and Framework for the Present Study Our assumptions and hypotheses for the study are embedded within a social–cognitive model originally proposed by Bandura 1986   . Bandura 1993    proposed that underlying self-efficacy beliefs of individuals afford an improved understanding of the cognitive processes and mechanisms that buffer a person's sense of control against the limitations of the loss of physical, social, and temporal resources. Within the context of spousal loss, our theoretical assumptions concerning the effects of widowhood derive from the premise that the extent to which elderly widows and widowers perceive a decline in quality of life or life satisfactions depends on their prewidowhood self-efficacy beliefs in specific domains of functioning and the personal significance of those domains to their previous functioning. Following Bandura's social–cognitive model (Bandura 1993   ), we posit that widows' and widowers' global sense of efficacy and domain-specific efficacies assists them in preserving positive perceptions of quality of life and positive perceptions of self-esteem and life satisfactions in the long term following spousal loss. Thus, social-learning theorists (for example, Bandura 1993   ; Berry and West 1993   ; Smith, Kohn, Savage-Stevens, Finch, et al. 2000   ) speculate that preexisting self-efficacy beliefs or expectancies of elderly individuals influence the level of effort they expend to preserve their quality of life and the level of perseverance they may exhibit in the face of threats to their perceived quality of life. Social–cognitive theorists would posit that widows and widowers with weaker self-efficacy beliefs, at the outset, may put forth less effort than individuals with stronger preexisting self-efficacy beliefs to combat diminishment and deterioration. Widowhood, Self-Efficacies, and Self-Esteem The gerontological literature on widowhood (e.g., Carr, House, Kessler, et al. 2000   ; Lund, Caserta, and Dimond 1993   ; Quandt, McDonald, Arcury, Bell, and Vitolis 2000   ) has implicated decline in self-esteem following spousal loss as a function of lowered emotional efficacy. Following spousal loss, further risks to self-esteem occur through a variety of pathways: Loss of meaningful spousal role and loss of significant relationships with other associates of the deceased spouse may erode self-esteem. Increased physical seclusion, social isolation, and reduction in social activities following spousal death may severely distort perceptions of self-worth and esteem (Arens 1982   ; Ferraro 1984   ). Finally, frequently diminished economic resources, instrumental dependency, and interpersonal dependency of the widowed spouse may increase vulnerability and lead to decline in self-esteem. The indications are (e.g., Bianchi's 1995   , meta-analysis review; Bengtson et al. 1990   ) that individuals with lower levels of self-efficacy are at greater risk for loss of self-esteem. No previous study, however, has been identified that examines the relationship between spousal loss, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. Overall Scope of the Study The major goal of the study was to examine the relationship between widowed persons' baseline ratings of self-efficacy beliefs taken at Time 1 (i.e., 4 to 6 months after spousal death) and widows' and widowers' assessments of perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem taken at Time 2 (i.e., at 18-month follow-up). In the prospective design proposed for the present study, self-efficacy beliefs were examined with respect to several specific domains of functioning. Our choice of a core of several domains of self-efficacy beliefs is predicated on previous research showing that several specific domains such as interpersonal efficacy (Carroll 1995   ), instrumental efficacy (Berry and West 1993   ), physical-health efficacy (Bausell 1986   ), social-support efficacy (Rowe and Kahn 1997   ), financial efficacy (Bryant and Morgan 1989   ), emotional efficacy (see Beckingham and Watt 1995   ), nutritional efficacy (Quandt et al. 2000   ), and spiritual-health efficacy (Fry 2001a    & 2001b) are individually related to the psychological well-being of elders. Certainly, no previous study has examined the predictive value of the full core of domain-specific self-efficacy of elderly persons in the context of spousal loss. Hypotheses Several hypotheses are proposed for the study.First, we hypothesized that global self-efficacy beliefs and domain-specific self-efficacy beliefs are both important to the prediction of widowed elderly individuals' perceptions of quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem following spousal loss. The logic of this hypothesis is consistent with Bandura 1993    proposal that self-efficacy is a global construct for some individuals but a domain-specific construct for others. Thus the two constructs need to be assessed separately. Second, we hypothesized that widows, compared with widowers, will show stronger baseline self-efficacy beliefs in the interpersonal, social-support adequacy, and spiritual domains, whereas widowers will show stronger self-efficacy beliefs in the financial, instrumental, and physical-health domains. These hypotheses of gender differences in domain-specific self-efficacy beliefs are substantiated by the findings of earlier studies (e.g., Antonucci 1990   ; Carr et al. 2000   ; Fry 1998   , Fry 2001a   , Fry 2001b   ; M. S. Stroebe and Stroebe 1983   ; N. Stroebe, Stroebe, and Schut 1997   ) showing that women, compared with men, have different domains of strength. Third, we hypothesized that widows' stronger self-efficacies in the domains of social-support adequacy, interpersonal efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy and widowers' stronger self-efficacies in the financial, instrumental, and physical-health domains would be predictive of higher levels of perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfaction, and self-esteem in the longer term following spousal loss. Fourth, on the basis of Bandura 1993    self-efficacy model of growth, we hypothesized that widowed individuals' self-efficacy beliefs in various domains of functioning would be more significant predictors of their perceived quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem than would the sociodemographic factors of income, education, social support, physical health, and age. Methods Participants and Recruitment Procedures Participants for the study were 118 widows and 93 widowers aged 65 to 85 years who volunteered for the study and who participated in both Time 1 and Time 2 assessments. The data for this study were collected as part of a larger regional community-support project concerned with offering social support to recently bereaved elderly adults (see Fry 1998   , Fry 2001a   , Fry 2001b   ). Community-residing widows and widowers for the present study were obtained mainly from among 284 attendees at social support groups for recently bereaved elders, organized by a number of seniors' centers and community agencies in three midsized cities in Southern Alberta. Participants were also recruited through community newsletters and posters placed in prime social services agencies and by word of mouth with caregivers of elderly persons. Eligibility criteria included spousal loss approximately 4 to 6 months ago. Other criteria were that participants must be English speaking, must reside in the community (not in institutions), and must not have physical or cognitive impairments that would preclude taking paper-and-pencil tests of psychological well-being.As a result of preliminary inquiry, 242 individuals (132 widows, 110 widowers) agreed to take baseline measures that were proposed for this study at Time 1 and agreed also to be followed up 12 months later at Time 2. Eleven volunteer participants (7 women, 4 men) did not meet the criterion of adequate physical and cognitive functioning and were excluded. Some further attrition in the sample (n = 20) occurred also at Time 2, partly because of relocation, disapproval by another family member, or from other functional difficulties experienced by the individual in the course of the 12 months preceding the follow-up. It should be noted that the final attrition rate at Time 2 was approximately 9%. The baselines of the 20 individuals who were absent at Time 2 assessments were compared with baselines of the 211 individuals who participated in Time 2 assessments. No significant differences were found between baselines of these individuals. Thus, analyses of the data that followed from Time 1 and Time 2 assessments are reported for a final sample of 211 widowed elderly persons (118 widows, 93 widowers). Description of Participants As seen in  Table 1  , participants were predominantly of Caucasian background; the majority of participants reported their health to be in the "good" category (categories were fair, good, excellent). Most participants had the equivalent of a high school education, and most reported that their income was adequate for making ends meet or for a comfortable living. The majority of participants reported that they had been married for over 20 years. Procedure Participants arranged to collect test materials from nominated research assistants. They had a brief 10-min meeting with the research assistant who went over the instructions and procedures for completing the paper-and-pencil tests. Participants completed the measures at their own pace, at home or in their place of work and study, and arranged to drop off the materials at prearranged drop-off centers. On average, respondents returned the completed measures within a 2-week period. On average, respondents reported it took them between 60 to 90 min to complete the paper-and-pencil tests. General Design The present study, designed to be an 18-month follow-up study, reports on a subset of 14 variables: sociodemographics (5), global self-efficacy measures (1), and domain-specific self-efficacy measures (8), which were hypothesized to be predictors of perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem in both samples of widows and widowers. At Time 1 (4 to 6 months after spousal loss), all participants responded to baseline measures of sociodemographics and self-efficacy reportings. A period of 4 to 6 months after spousal loss was chosen on the basis of Parkes 1995    guidelines and Parkes and Weiss 1983    comments, noting that it is ethically not appropriate to intrude on bereaved individuals' privacy before this time. At Time 2 (i.e., 18-months follow-up of respondents) participants responded to various psychosocial measures including the Health-Related Quality of Life Perceptions Scale (HRQOL), Life Satisfaction Index (LSIA), and Self-Esteem Index (SEI). An 18-month period for follow-up of participants was proposed for both theoretical and practical considerations. A number of studies on widowhood (e.g., Fry 1998   , Fry 2001a   , Fry 2001b   ; Lieberman 1996   ; Lopata 1973   ; Parkes and Weiss 1983   ) have implicated 2 years following spousal loss to be a critical period of adjustment to spousal loss and a changed quality of life. Practical considerations were that individuals involved in the study were uncertain about future plans and therefore unwilling to commit to a longer term follow-up beyond the 2 years following spousal loss. Measures Adopting constructs of quality of life developed by earlier researchers (e.g., Diener 1984   ; Diener and Suh 1997   ; Lawton 1991   ) and recent researchers who have investigated quality-of-life components (e.g., Allen, Becker, and Swank 1990   ; Oka, Gortner, Stotts, and Haskell 1996   ), we selected both objective indicators of quality of life (e.g., income, gender, education, social support, and health status) and subjective measures of quality of life such as perceived health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem. Although some concern has been expressed in the gerontological literature (e.g., Lohmann 1977   ) in regard to life satisfaction and quality of life being highly correlated measures, Lawton, Moss, Hoffman, and colleagues (1999) and Hoyt and Creech 1983    confirmed that these measures are independent. Preliminary analyses in our study also confirmed that correlations among the dependent measures of health-related quality of life, life satisfaction, and self-esteem were only minimally significant, with coefficients ranging between .11 and .16. Baseline Measures Sociodemographic Characteristics. Sociodemographic characteristics included in these analyses were age, gender, income, education, physical health status, and social support status. Education was measured as the highest grade completed. Final analyses used a dichotomous classification of less than 12 years completed versus 12 or more years completed. Annual income was measured in $10,000 increments to $40,000. Final analyses used a dichotomous classification of $15,000 to $20,000 versus $20,000 to $35,000. In the present study, we decided to use both objective measures of social-support availability and physical health and subjective measures of perceived social support efficacy and perceived physical health efficacy. Physical Health Status Objective Indicator. Physical health was assessed by a 26-item physical health checklist of illnesses (Older Americans Resources and Services; Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development 1978   ) most commonly encountered by older adults. This is a measure that has been widely used in gerontological studies to assess physical-health status (e.g., Fry 2001a   ; Lawton et al. 1999   ). Participants responded yes or no to the question, "Do you have any of the following illnesses at the present time?" A high score of yes responses was assumed to reflect poor health status. Alpha coefficients were .69 to .75 for the present sample of widows and widowers, respectively. Social-Support Resources. These resources were measured by a shorter modified version of the Multidimensional Scale of Social Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, and Farley 1988   ). This scale has been used with nonclinical samples of elderly individuals (e.g., Fry 1998   , Fry 2001b   ). Fry 2001b   , using the short form, reported excellent psychometric properties, reliability, and validity for an elderly sample of widowed individuals, especially considering the limited number of items in the scale. Internal reliability (alpha coefficient) was .86. Three sources of available support were measured by asking individuals to report the number of persons among family, friends, and significant others regularly available to give social support. A composite higher score was construed to mean higher social-support availability from the three sources. Cronbach's coefficients were .76 and .86 for widows and widowers, respectively. Self-Efficacy Measures. 1. Subscales of Domain-Specific Efficacy. The baseline measure of domain-specific efficacies in this study was composed of 25 items (each arranged on a 4-point Likert scale) that were developed and validated on two pilot-study samples drawn from my previous studies (Fry 1998   , Fry 2001a   , Fry 2001b   ). Participants for the pilot studies were selected on the basis of sociodemographic criteria similar to those used in the present study. Self-efficacy perceptions identified in eight life domains (interpersonal, instrumental, emotional, social support, financial, physical health, nutritional, and spiritual health) were found to be of particular relevance to the day-to-day functioning of older adults. Eight subscales, with 35 items, were created on the basis of a priori selection of items, item analysis, factor loadings, and a rational approach to scaling that argues for a strategy of constructing summary measures from moderately rather than highly correlated items (Edwards 1970   ; Goldberg 1972   ). With further refinement of items and elimination of 10 items with low reliability, the inter-item correlations were improved for the remaining 25 items, and ranged from .69 to .73. Three-month test–retest reliability data drawn from a previous pilot study of 87 individuals showed subscale correlations ranging from .50 to .67 (see Bandura's 1977   , Bandura's 1993   , discussion in support of moderate correlations among subscales of domain-specific efficacies). Cronbach's alphas for the eight subscales ranged from .70 to .78 and from .77 to .81 for widows and widowers, respectively. (Details of the eight subscales of domain-specific efficacies, along with specimen items and coding procedures are provided in the  A .)2. Global Efficacy Index. This baseline measure consisted of one item: "Taking into account various areas of my day-to-day functioning (for example, personal life, social life, family life, religious life, physical health, and emotional health), I feel I am handling myself competently." This item was scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale (ranging from strongly agree [4] to strongly disagree [1]). The higher the score obtained, the stronger was the individual's perceived global self-efficacy. Dependent Measures An abbreviated measure of the HRQOL (Stewart, Hays, and Ware 1988   ) was developed using three subscales of the SF-36. The HRQOL is a widely used and validated measure for collecting elderly individuals' health status information, and short forms and longer forms of the HRQOL have been used in several recent studies of elderly adults (e.g., Lyons, Perry, and Littlepage 1994   ; Leon and Moyer 1999   ). The SF-36 assessment provides eight multi-item subscales derived from using a 3-point to 6-point Likert-type measure for collecting physical- and mental-health-related information. Our review of the findings of the various studies in which the SF-36 item survey was used revealed that the three subscales of general health perceptions, vitality, and mental health perceptions had been found to reflect the best summary measures of mental and physical health-related quality-of-life assessments. They also conveyed the information most relevant to clinicians and those in outcome research (see discussion by Arnold 1991   ; Leon and Moyer 1999   ). They are recognized to be the best summary measures of health-related quality of life (see Chapter 10 in Ware, Kosinski, and Keller 1994   ), and have high reliability and greatest relevance to elders' health status. These three subscale measures are (a) Subscale for General Health Perceptions, which evaluates current general health as well as whether or not the person believes his or her health will deteriorate (five questions), (b) the Vitality Subscale, which determines the degree to which the person feels full of energy and "pep" as well as how often he or she is tired or worn out (four questions), and (c) Mental Health Subscale, which examines nervousness and feelings of depression, sadness, peacefulness, and happiness (five questions). Responses to the 14 questions included in the composite measure of the three subscales of the HRQOL were arranged on a 5-point Likert type scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). The higher the cumulative score, the more positive are the HRQOL perceptions. Range of scores on this measure is 14 to 70. Following procedures approved by Ware and colleagues 1994   , we derived an aggregate HRQOL score for each individual based on the subscale scores of general health perceptions, vitality, and mental health. Cronbach's alphas for this survey were .75 and .82 for widows and widowers, respectively. LSIA; Neugarten, Havighurst, & Tobin, 1961. This is a 20-item scale designed to measure subjective feelings of well-being and satisfaction among older adults. Life satisfaction is viewed as a multifaceted concept incorporating domains of well-being, finding life meaningful, a feeling of success in achieving goals, a positive self-image, and an optimistic attitude (McDowell and Newell 1987   ; Neugarten et al. 1961   ). Validity studies compared the LSIA scale with the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (Lohmann 1977   ) and life satisfaction ratings by clinical psychologists (Neugarten et al. 1961   ), with correlations of .74 and .64, respectively. Independent factor analysis studies (Hoyt and Creech 1983   ) have reported consistent findings of a three-factor solution of congruence, mood tone, and optimism. The LSIA is one of the more widely used scales of life satisfaction for older adults, and has several strengths of reliability, strong correlations with other scales, and consistent validity findings (McDowell and Newell 1987   ). The present study used the original "agree/disagree" response format. Scores range from 0 to 20. Higher scores represent higher levels of life satisfaction. Cronbach's alphas for this inventory were .76 and .74 for widows and widowers, respectively. SEI. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (Rosenberg 1979   ) was used to measure self-esteem as a global and stable disposition. This measure is widely known and the most frequently used measure for different age populations. The inventory has 10 items, 5 positively keyed and 5 negatively keyed, and all items used a 4-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). The negatively keyed items were recoded, and the 10 items were summed to produce a total score showing that higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem. Scores range from 10 to 40 on this self-esteem measure. Cronbach's alphas for this inventory were .80 and .72 for widows and widowers, respectively.All paper-and-pencil self-report measures used in this study were previously piloted on an independent volunteer sample of 40 older adults who met all of the same eligibility criteria used for participants in this present study. Statistical Design and Analyses A hierarchical multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted on the data derived from the 14 predictor variables: 5 sociodemographic variables, 1 global self-efficacy index, and 8 subscales of domain-specific self-efficacy. The order of entry of the predictor variables into the linear regression model was based on methodological, historical, and theoretical considerations in the gerontological literature on spousal bereavement and widowhood (e.g., Arens 1982   ; Fry 1998   , Fry 2000   , Fry 2001b   ; Siegel and Kuykendall 1990   ; Wortman and Silver 1990   ; Yalom and Lieberman 1991   ) and on psychosocial development and self-efficacy development in late life (Rodin and McAvay 1992   ; Seeman, Unger, McAvay, and Mendes de Leon 1999   ). Consistent with order of entry of variables proposed by these earlier studies, the block of sociodemographic variables was entered first in the regression model, followed by global self-efficacy (Step 2) and the block of eight subscale efficacies (Step 3). Instances of missing data were rare (<1%), therefore presenting little concern about Type I and related Type II errors occurring (Schumacker and Lomax 1996   ). All analyses were performed using SAS 6.12 software (SAS Institute 1990   ). Results Means and standard deviations for the predictor and dependent variables for 118 widows and 93 widowers are shown in  Table 2  . It is seen that the group of widows, compared with the group of widowers, scored significantly higher in the self-report measures of multidimensional efficacy and in the overall health-related quality of life perceptions. Comparatively speaking, widows showed lower ratings in self-esteem. There were no significant differences in the self-reportings of life satisfactions between widows and widowers. Details of bivariate correlations of health-related quality-of-life measures (HRQOL, LSIA, and SEI), sociodemographic variables, and other predictor variables of global and domain-specific efficacies are presented separately for widows and widowers (see  Table 3  ). All predictor variables of sociodemographics, global self-efficacy, and subscale measures of eight domain-specific efficacies were significantly related to measures of health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem for both widows and widowers. As a test for possible multicollinearity, we calculated the intercorrelations among the dependent variables and independent predictor variables. Bivariate correlational matrices, variance inflation factor (VIF) values, and tolerance criteria (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, and Black 1995   ) indicated no significant multicollinearity. Intercorrelations were modest, ranging from .14 to .27, median = .08. Thus multicollinearity did not present a concern. Independent sample t tests (df = 209) were conducted on all measures used, and as they were all significantly different at the p < .05 level, they were subsequently entered in the two separate regression analyses for widows and widowers (see  Table 4  and  Table 5  ). It should be noted that the potential for Type 1 errors was closely monitored in the series of hierarchical regression analyses conducted separately for widows' and widowers' samples. It was judged to be minimal and did not present a concern. Widows' Sample HRQOL. Sociodemographic variables failed to account for significant variance in HRQOL. However, the Global Self-Efficacy Measure, when entered in Step 2, accounted for a significant increase in explained variance (i.e., 16%), and the subscale efficacies, when entered together in Step 3, collectively accounted for a further significant increase in explained variance in HRQOL (i.e., 39%). As indicated by significant beta values, interpersonal efficacy, emotional efficacy, social-support efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy emerged as salient predictors of HRQOL for widows (see significant beta values in  Table 4  , under HRQOL). LSIA. Sociodemographic variables entered in Step 1 of the regression accounted for 8% of the variance in LSIA, which is quite significant. Global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies, when entered in Steps 2 and 3, accounted for 18% and 31%, respectively, of the explained variance in LSIA, which is also very significant (see  Table 4  ). Subscale efficacy variables that made a unique and salient contribution to the explained variance include interpersonal efficacy, emotional efficacy, social-support efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy (see significant beta values in  Table 4  , under LSIA). SEI. With the exception of social support, sociodemographic variables failed to contribute significantly to the variance in SEI of elderly widows. However, when global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies were entered in Steps 2 and 3 of the regression, they accounted for 22% and 31%, respectively, of the explained variance in the SEI of elderly widows. As indicated by their significant beta values, interpersonal efficacy, instrumental efficacy, emotional efficacy, social-support efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy individually made a unique and salient contribution to the variance in SEI of elderly widows (see significant beta values in  Table 4  , under SEI). Widowers' Sample HRQOL. The results of linear regression analysis performed on the widowers' sample show that the sociodemographic variables collectively accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in HRQOL (i.e., 8%). Similarly, when global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies were entered in Steps 2 and 3 of the regression, they accounted for 17% and 23%, respectively, of the explained variance in HRQOL of elderly widowers. As indicated by their significant beta values, instrumental efficacy, financial efficacy, physical-health efficacy, and nutritional efficacy individually made a salient contribution to the explained variance in HRQOL of widowers (see significant beta values in  Table 5  , under HRQOL). LSIA. The regression analyses show that sociodemographic variables, entered together in Step 1, accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in LSIA (i.e., 7%). Similarly, when global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies were entered in Steps 2 and 3 of the regression, they accounted for 22% and 26%, respectively, of explained variance in LSIA. As indicated by their significant beta values, instrumental efficacy, emotional efficacy, financial efficacy, and physical-health efficacy individually made a significant contribution to the explained variance in LSIA of widowers (see  Table 5  for significant beta values, under LSIA). SEI. The regression analyses show that sociodemographic variables, entered in Step 1, accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in SEI (i.e., 11%). Global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies, entered in Steps 2 and 3, accounted for 26% and 25%, respectively, of the explained variance in SEI of the widowers. As indicated by their significant beta values, instrumental efficacy, emotional efficacy, financial efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy individually accounted for a significant level of variance in SEI of widowers (see significant beta values in  Table 5  , under SEI).As evident in both sets of regression analyses for widows and widowers, global self-efficacy and subscale efficacies accounted for almost double the percentage of variance that was accounted for by the sociodemographic variables toward predicting HRQOL, LSIA, and SEI (see  Table 4  and  Table 5  ). Salient Gender Differences A comparison of the two sets of hierarchical regression analysis for the widows' and widowers' samples revealed a number of salient gender differences. First, education and income were significantly more potent predictors of quality of life, life satisfaction, and self-esteem for widowers, compared with widows. Second, the subscale efficacies that contributed to the predictive value were different for the two groups. Instrumental efficacy, financial efficacy, and physical-health efficacy uniformly revealed higher beta weights for widowers, compared with widows. Conversely, interpersonal efficacy, emotional efficacy, social-support efficacy, and spiritual-health efficacy uniformly revealed higher beta weights for widows, compared with widowers. Discussion The social–cognitive framework that we proposed for the present study is based on Bandura 1977   , Bandura 1993    theoretical formulation that self-efficacy beliefs of individuals in various domains of functioning contribute to their physical and mental health-related quality of life. As hypothesized, weaker levels of perceived self-efficacy in various domains such as interpersonal, instrumental, emotional, social support, financial, physical health, nutritional, and spiritual health at Time 1 (baselines) were associated with lowered perceptions of health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem for both widows and widowers at Time 2 (follow-up). On the basis of our results, which show significant associations between baseline self-efficacy ratings and ratings of health-related quality of life, life satisfactions, and self-esteem at follow-up, it seems reasonable to conclude that preexisting weak and strong domains of self-efficacy of elderly spouses are indeed reliable predictors of their later adjustments to spousal loss and widowhood.The finding that widows, compared with widowers, had stronger levels of perceived efficacy in the interpersonal, social-support, and spiritual-health domains and that widowers had stronger levels of perceived efficacy in the financial, instrumental, and physical-health domains is consistent with the hypothesis of the present study, and supports the findings implicit in previous studies (see Arens 1982   ; Bianchi's 1995   , review; Carr et al. 2000   ; Ferraro, Mutran, and Barresi 1984   ; Lopata 1973   ) that have examined gender differences in widowed persons. Several earlier researchers have speculated that women's confidence in beliefs about their ability to manage interpersonal activities, to generate large social networks, and to sustain inner strength through spiritual beliefs helped them adjust more easily than men have to various losses, including loss of a primary relationship. Our findings support this speculation. The findings tell an interesting story about gender differences in interpersonal dependence, instrumental dependence, financial dependence, and spiritual dependence that has important implications for practitioners. They further substantiate Bandura's social–cognitive position, which argues that strong perceptions of self-efficacy in various domains such as interpersonal, social, and instrumental may be more conducive to higher levels of life satisfactions and self-esteem, whereas weak perceptions of self-efficacy in various domains may imply that the individual is at risk for lowered self-esteem following a crisis or a critical loss.The overall finding that self-efficacy beliefs in several domains were more important predictors of perceived quality of life and life satisfactions for both widows and widowers than were sociodemographic factors is also consistent with the hypothesis of the present study. Implications of the Findings for Practitioners The transcending theme of perceived self-efficacy in various domains as predicting the quality of life and life satisfactions for both widows and widowers has important implications for practitioners. The fact that self-efficacy beliefs are modifiable (see Bandura 1993   ; Meichenbaum 1994   ) makes them an excellent target for interventions with widowed individuals who may be struggling with weak self-efficacy beliefs in several domains of independence, autonomy, and control. While surveying the history of widowed individuals, practitioners need to take greater account of domains of weak and strong self-efficacy beliefs to plan programs of self-care and self-management consistent with their efficacy needs. Specific domains in which perceived self-efficacy is low should be identified through discussion with the widowed individuals, and practitioners may offer suggestions for enhancing self-efficacy. Because spiritual health-efficacy emerged as a strong predictor of life satisfactions and self-esteem of widowed elderly people, its importance in intervention programs should be more widely recognized by practitioners. Currently, intervention programs to assist widowed individuals in adjusting to spousal loss have focused exclusively on teaching new social skills and new instrumental tasks (see Caserta, Lund, and Rice 1999   ; Stroebe and Stroebe 1987   ). Recently however, several researchers (e.g., Campbell and Silverman 1999   ; Fry 2001b   ; Thorson 1999   ; Yalom and Lieberman 1991   ) are urging geriatric practitioners to include components for strengthening self-efficacy, especially spiritual self-efficacy, in intervention programs for adjusting to spousal loss. Limitations of the Study Several limitations are acknowledged. First, as with any study of such a sensitive nature as spousal loss, the use of volunteer participants, although unavoidable, presents an important limitation to the sampling framework. The sample, although generally representative of community elders, is skewed toward individuals who were White, in fair to very good health, and living in the southern region of Alberta. Consequently, the generalizability of this study is limited by the characteristics of the sample. A second limitation is that the number of years for which individuals were married was not included as a predictive variable, and we did not consider potential interactions among variables in our exploratory study. Consequently, future follow-up studies based on ours may find our initial model to be limited in these respects. In spite of these shortcomings, it should be noted that we expanded on prior research in a number of ways. First, we used prospective data to examine the possible contributions of self-efficacy beliefs of widowed elderly (at baseline) to their perceived quality of life and life satisfactions at 18-month follow-up. On the basis of our preliminary findings, we concluded that there is a strong predictive link between self-efficacy beliefs of bereaved spouses and their future resiliency. Second, we focused on men and women separately and were able to identify different sets of self-efficacy domains that characterize current cohorts of elderly widows and widowers. Both these features are of considerable relevance to the work of geriatric clinicians and counselors and until recently have been neglected in studies of widowhood and overlooked in intervention programs for widowed elderly people.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews The Domain-Specific Efficacy Measure Eight subscales of domain-specific efficacies (with a total of 25 items) were developed as follows.Three items reflecting interpersonal efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage relationships with family, friends and acquaintances, for example: "I am able to make sure that my relationships with family and friends are as satisfying and rewarding as I would like them to be." "I am able to make sure that my relationships with both my superiors and subordinates are as rewarding and satisfying as I would like them to be."Four items reflecting instrumental efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage instrumental activities, for example: "I am able to make sure that I have satisfactory arrangements and necessary help for my daily needs such as transportation, household work, errands and chores." "I am able to make sure that I have satisfactory arrangements and necessary help for protecting my personal privacy and safety."Three items reflecting emotional efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage emotional balance and to be calm during periods of difficulty and stress, for example: "I am able to make sure that I do not get too caught in conflict situations to cause me to go out of control."Three items reflecting social support efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate adequate social support, for example: "I am able to make sure that I always have a small group of supportive individuals on whom I can rely for help and unconditional support." "I am able to make sure I have friends who will alert me to potential risks and danger."Three items reflecting financial efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage one's financial affairs satisfactorily, for example: "I am able to make sure that I plan my finances and expenses in a way that is as satisfying and rewarding to me as I would like." "I am able to make sure that I manage my money matters in a way that is as satisfying as I would like, for members of my family and social networks."Two items reflecting physical health efficacy beliefs relating to one's beliefs about the importance of physical health, for example: "I am able to make sure that I get prompt physical and medical attention when there is any risk to my health." "I am able to make sure that I maintain healthy habits of exercise, rest and relaxation."Three items reflecting nutritional efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage nutritional intake satisfactorily, for example: "I am able to make sure that I take care of my nutritional needs on a daily basis." "I am able to make sure that I maintain healthy eating habits."Four items reflecting spiritual health efficacy beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, for example: "Even in hard times, the meaning and purpose I have found for my life provides me a sense of peace and harmony" "Even in a time of struggle I can go to a spiritual dimension within myself for guidance"Coding procedures: All 25 items were scored on a 4-point scale (strongly agree [4], strongly disagree [1]). Scores for the total scale range from 25 to 100. Respondents are encouraged to respond carefully to each item in order to obviate missing scores in any subscale items. Summary scores for the subscales reflect the average of item responses, weighted by the number of items in the subscale.  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study compared the response time, response rate, and cost of two types of survey administration techniques: e-mail/web-based versus conventional postal mail. The main aim of the survey was to collect descriptive information on the existence of Acute Care for Elders units and their characteristics by surveying geriatric division chiefs. Design and Methods: Two randomized cohorts of geriatric division chiefs were formed to receive a survey either by electronic mail (n = 57) or by conventional postal mail (n = 57). If there was no response to the initial mailing, two follow-up mailings were sent to both groups using the original modality; a third follow-up was performed using the alternative modality. For each group, response rate and response time were calculated. The average total cost was computed and compared across two groups. Results: The aggregate response rate was 58% (n = 31) for the e-mail group versus 77% (n = 44) for the postal mail group. The overall average response time was shorter in the e-mail group, 18 days compared with 33 days for the conventional postal mailing group. The cost comparison showed that average cost was $7.70 for the e-mail group, compared to $10.50 per response for the conventional mail group. Implications: It appears that although the web-based technology is gaining popularity and leads to lower cost per response, the conventional postal method of surveying continues to deliver a better response rate among the geriatric medicine division chiefs. The web-based approach holds promise given its lower costs and acceptable response rate combined with the shorter response time.   Electronic mail ,  Mail surveys ,  Survey techniques Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDRecently, Internet-based survey techniques have been gaining popularity for health care research and medical applications (Houston and Fiore 1998   ; Jones and Pitt 1999   ; Lakeman 1997   ; Schleyer and Forrest 2000   ; Thomas, Stamler, Lafreniere, and Dumula 2000   ). The Internet provides a new survey technique to the geriatric research community in targeting the geriatric populations in a more cost-effective way. Despite the growing enthusiasm for Internet-based surveys (Lakeman 1997   ; Schleyer and Forrest 2000   ), the geriatric medical community seems to have fallen behind in the effective use of this technique. The current literature indicates that when using conventional survey techniques, such as postal surveys, researchers can expect a response rate ranging from 70% to 75% (Davis 1999   ; Jones and Pitt 1999   ). On the other hand, the response rates for electronic mail surveys have been found to vary from 34% to 76% (Eley 1999   ; Jones and Pitt 1999   ). These numbers, however, should be viewed with caution because there is a paucity of substantial comparison studies, and none are noted in the geriatric research community. Additionally, the nature of the sample or the target group, the conditions under which the survey was administered, and the content of the survey can have profound implications on response rate and effectiveness of Internet-based survey techniques (Houston and Fiore 1998   ; Jones and Pitt 1999   ; Lakeman 1997   ; Schleyer and Forrest 2000   ).  Table 1  displays some of the benefits and drawbacks of a postal survey versus an e-mail/web-based survey (Houston and Fiore 1998   ; Jones and Pitt 1999   ; Lakeman 1997   ; Schleyer and Forrest 2000   ; Thomas et al. 2000   ).We compared the attributes of an e-mail/web-based survey to a conventional postal survey. This study was part of a larger project on Acute Care for Elders (ACE) units and the main aim of the survey was to collect descriptive information on the existence of ACE units and their characteristics. We present a comparison of the response rate, response time, and administration costs between electronic mail and conventional postal mail surveys, targeted toward the geriatrics programs and division chiefs across the country. Methods The study population consisted of 114 chiefs of established geriatric medical divisions and geriatric teaching programs across the United States. The names, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses for the study population were obtained by reviewing the following sources: the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) board of directors and task force committees, American Directory of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP), and Geriatric Education Centers (GEC). Two groups, each containing 57 institutions, were formed by random assignment of the study population. The institutions were numbered from 1 to 114; then, with the help of random number tables, an institution was assigned to either e-mail group (group 1) or the conventional postal mailing group (group 2). The process was repeated until each group had 57 institutions. We obtained e-mail addresses for chiefs in group 1 via the following sources: Internet institution directory sites, professional medical society directories of the AGS, American College of Physicians, The Gerontological Society of America, GEC lists, ADGAP program directories, and the Association of American Medical Colleges Graduate Medical Education directory. We were able to obtain e-mail addresses for 40 chiefs by using these methods. For the remaining 13 chiefs, whose e-mail could not be obtained by these methods, we obtained e-mail addresses from their office assistants without disclosing the study. Four individuals who did not have an e-mail address were excluded from the e-mail survey group; thus, the adjusted denominator for group 1 was 53. For group 2 (n = 57), the most recent postal mailing addresses from the sources mentioned were used. Survey Design The survey instrument was designed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of ACE units among academic geriatric programs. The survey (see the  Table A1  1) consisted of 17 multiple-choice questions, including questions on the existence, size, length of stay, and patient characteristics of the ACE unit and demographics.To develop the web-based version of the survey, Claris Home Page 3.0 was used to format the survey with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Functional testing of the web page was successful on Netscape and Internet explorer platforms on both Macintosh and Windows-based computers. Each question was reviewed for readability and ease of downloading. Downloading took only a few seconds, and the survey took about 5 minutes to complete. List boxes, radio buttons, and check boxes were provided because none of the questions were open ended; the format was simple, with consistent positioning of check buttons that made concentrating on the questions easy. The preliminary draft of the survey was reviewed within the Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. The faculty was asked to comment on the various aspects of the survey, such as question format, layout, wording, and duration. We responded by revising some of the questions for their content and omitting one question altogether. Survey Administration Respondents in the e-mail group received a letter stating the purpose of the survey and our contact information. The survey could be accessed through the e-mail letter as an attachment in an HTML format and/or as a hyper link to our survey on the World Wide Web. The Uniform Resource Locator address for the location of the survey was not stated in the letter, but an access button was created for convenience and to restrict unsolicited responses. Thus, the e-mail group could respond to the survey by completing and returning the attachment, by accessing and completing the survey on web page, or by printing out the survey and mailing back the completed survey via postal mail or fax. In total, three follow-ups were done for the nonrespondents. For those who did not respond to the first e-mail survey request, surveys were re-sent twice at 5-day intervals. The third and final follow-up for the nonrespondents was performed through conventional postal mail (the alternative method).Respondents in the conventional postal mail group received an introductory letter similar to group 1. The chiefs received a hard copy of the survey and a self-addressed, stamped return envelope. They were also given an option to return the survey via fax. For nonrespondents in group 2, three follow-ups were done in total. They were re-sent the postal mail survey twice, allowing about 20 days between each attempt. The third and final follow-up for the nonrespondents was performed by e-mail (the alternative method). It is important to note here that the allocated time space between subsequent follow-ups is different for the two groups. We had to take into account the longer institutional processing time for conventional mail. For each group, response rate and response time were calculated. The response time was defined as the number of days between the date the survey was sent out and the date it was received. Hence, the first mailing and subsequent follow-ups were treated as discrete events.The overall costs included labor, supplies, and postal costs. Costs of the final follow-up by the alternative method were not included. The average total cost was computed and compared across two groups. Finally, paired t-test and chi-square statistics were used to compare the average group response rate and response time. Results The e-mail group had four individuals with either incorrect or no e-mail address, thus reducing the total number of participants in this group to 53. Although these individuals were sent a postal mail survey, their responses were excluded for the purpose of this study. The first attempt received maximum responses in both groups, with a 39% response rate in the e-mail group and a 63% response rate in the conventional postal mailing group. For both groups, the response rate showed a decreasing trend during the second and third follow-ups. Key findings are summarized in  Table 2  . Response Rate There was a significant (p < .001) difference in aggregate response rate of all three attempts, with 58% for the e-mail group and 77% for the conventional mail group. For the e-mail group, the total number of responses for the three attempts was 31 out of 53. Of these, 23 responses were returned via e-mail. Eight respondents (26%) in the e-mail group preferred to print out the survey and responded either through postal mail or fax. However, after the third follow-up attempt through conventional postal mailing follow-up, the total response rate was increased to 83% (n = 44) for the e-mail group. For the conventional mail group, total number of responses for the first three mailings was 44 out of 57 (77%). The third and final follow-up attempt, using e-mail, resulted in increasing the total responses to 46 (81%).Following the completion of the study, the e-mail nonresponders were contacted to better understand the nonresponder behavior and influencing factors. Individuals who did not respond to all three e-mail attempts (n = 6), but completed a conventional postal mail survey, were contacted personally by telephone and asked why they did not respond via e-mail. The reasons reported included a higher level of comfort with the conventional mail survey (n = 1), unavailability of e-mail accounts (n = 2), and lack of technical savvy with the Internet and attachments (n = 3). Therefore, in group 1, in addition to four for whom we could not identify an e-mail address, three more individuals had but did not use e-mail accounts. Thus, approximately 12% of the e-mail group was inaccessible electronically. Response Time There was a significant difference in the response time between the two groups (p < .001). The average response time for the e-mail group was 18 days, with 30% of the responses arriving within 24 hours after request. On the other hand, for the conventional postal mailing group, the average response time was 33 days. The first response from the conventional postal mailing group was received on the 15th day. This suggests that e-mail surveys are capable of generating much quicker responses compared with conventional postal surveys. For the e-mail group, the average electronic response time for the first attempt was 3.3 days. The average electronic response time for the second attempt was 4.7 days and for the third attempt was 2.3 days. For the conventional postal group, the average response time for the first mailing was 21 days. The average response time for the second mailing was 15.5 days and for the third mailing was 21 days. Cost Analysis We calculated average cost per response for both groups. The total costs included the labor costs involved in survey preparation, follow-up, survey administration, data input, stationary cost, and postage cost. We derived these costs based on the cost estimates for our institution letterhead, large and regular mailing envelopes, hard copies of the survey, and postage for both our mailing of the envelopes and prepaid return envelopes. Long-distance telephone calls and Internet connection costs were not included. The labor cost differed for each activity: The development of an Internet-based e-mail survey required a research assistant with reasonable computer skills at $40.00 per hour, whereas for all other activities (data input, postal mailing survey administration, and survey preparation) the cost was $20.00 per hour.The average cost per response was $10.50 for conventional postal mail group and $7.70 for the e-mail group. Thus, the conventional postal mail survey costs were 27% higher than the e-mail survey. This higher cost of a conventional postal mail survey can be attributed to the extra costs of stationary, postage, administration, and follow-up. However, for longitudinal surveys and surveys of large populations, cost of survey administration and follow-ups can be reduced significantly by using e-mail/web-based survey techniques.  Table 3  presents the cost analysis for both groups.For the e-mail group, the task of survey preparation was more expensive compared to administration and follow-up costs. It required 2 hours at the rate of $40 per hour for a computer professional to set up the web-based survey. The survey administration, follow-up, and data input costs were small ($60 in total) for the e-mail group. On the other hand, the task of survey preparation accounted for only a small portion of the total cost for the conventional postal mailing group, with $17 for institutional letterheads and other stationary. In this case, survey administration, follow-up, and data input were the more expensive items. Survey administration required a total of $197 ($57 in postage, 2 hours of labor at the rate of $20 per hour, and $100 for obtaining the ADGAP address list). Survey follow-up cost was $150 for two follow-up attempts, and an additional $100 was required for data input. The costs of the fourth attempt by the alternative method were not included in the cost analysis. However, it should be noted that costs are extremely sensitive to the complexity and the length of the survey. A lengthier survey would increase the administration, follow-up, and data input costs significantly in group 2. Actual sending of the e-mail surveys did not take as long as preparing and sending the postal mail surveys, but it did take much longer to sort out problems with incorrect e-mail addresses, redirects, and miscommunication via e-mail messaging and other incidentals. Discussion Although the postal mail survey had a higher response, e-mail questionnaires are a promising way to survey the division chiefs of geriatric medicine because of lower response time and costs. Currently there are many reports available that describe the methods involved in conducting an e-mail or web-based survey. However, little knowledge exists about the effectiveness of this technique among geriatric chiefs and the barriers faced in implementing these techniques.Earlier studies have indicated the ways in which e-mail or web-based surveys could be used across different health professionals. Researchers at Temple University, Philadelphia, developed a web-based survey with 22 questions to study the use of the Internet in clinical practice. They recruited 450 dentists from an e-mail address list to receive this web-based survey. Participants were sent one e-mail, and a maximum of three e-mail follow-ups were sent to the nonresponders. E-mail response rates, strictly defined as an e-mail only, were 32.9%, 50.2%, 57.1%, and 64.4% for the chronological attempts. The addition of alternative responses, such as fax or mail, raised total response rate to 74.2%. The cost comparison indicated almost 50% reduction in total cost for e-mail surveys compared with conventional mail surveys ($1,916 compared with a hypothetical postal cost of $3,092). A minimum of 275 e-mail responses were recommended to break even on the costs of e-mail and to make it a more economical method than postal mail (Schleyer and Forrest 2000   ). This study differs from our study because recruited participants were established e-mail users.The process of obtaining e-mail addresses through mailing address lists was extremely labor-intensive, despite the availability of a number of Internet search engines. This finding was less of an issue in other studies, such as the dental study described, and suggests that geriatrics is lagging other medical subspecialties in creating searchable electronic databases of its physicians. The existence of such a database would have made the electronic surveys even more cost-effective.A study of university staff done in the United Kingdom compared the response timing and rates using electronic and paper methods. E-mail health surveys that required web-based submission were sent to 200 people, and 100 other people received traditional postal surveys. The postal mail survey received a response rate of 72%, followed by 32% with respect to e-mail and 19% for the World Wide Web. Although e-mail and web-based surveys were quicker and cheaper by half, the authors concluded that the higher response rate made postal mail more preferable (Jones and Pitt 1999   ). Caution must be exercised, because the overall cost is extremely sensitive to the type and scale of the target population. If the Internet usage of the target population is low, a great deal of effort would be expended trying to locate e-mail addresses for people who are not reachable electronically; among those who could be reached, response rates could be poor as a result of inadequate Internet skills.An experiment comparing the response rates and response time for different approaches to mailing highlighted the strengths and weakness of e-mail surveys. In this study, the respondents recruited from the Internet received postal mail or e-mail surveys. The respondents were randomly assigned to one of five groups. Group 1 consisted of regular mail with no prenotification, no incentives, and no reminders (n = 202); group 2 consisted of regular mail with prenotification, incentives, and reminders (n = 107); and groups 3 (n = 60) and 4 (n = 122) were e-mail replications of groups 1 and 2. The final group (n = 172) is an international group, otherwise the same as group 4. The results showed that e-mail surveys had much lower response time (2–3 days vs 3 weeks) and higher response rates (40% in group 1 vs 45% in group 3). In the prenotified groups the rates increased to 63% and 83%, respectively, and were much less expensive compared to conventional mail surveys (Mehta and Sivadas 1995   ).None of the previously reported survey research has directly compared the postal mail and the electronic web-based mail in a random selection method in the geriatric community. In addition, all previous studies utilized established e-mail address lists, implying that the potential respondents were known to have both a working e-mail address and Internet access. Open recruitment of participants as well as guaranteed Internet users as participants has commonly occurred in other published research (Eley 1999   ; Mehta and Sivadas 1995   ). Our study differs in this respect since we had no prior knowledge of the computer skill level of the participants or their level of Internet knowledge.The higher response rate for the conventional mail group was countered by a longer response time in our study. On the other hand, the administration of the e-mail surveys resulted in faster responses and was more cost-effective albeit with a lower overall response rate. It should be noted that, from the first three attempts, we received 31 responses from the e-mail group and 44 responses from the conventional mail group. The electronic response was acceptable but still not as high as expected. The response rate of 58% for the e-mail group is less than other published results that indicate a response rate closer to 70% (Lakeman 1997   ; Mehta and Sivadas 1995   ). This discrepancy may have been due to the fact that our target population is unlike the other research populations that used existing Internet or e-mail user lists. Also, it is important to note that our response rates, response time, and related cost for the chiefs may not be generalized to other physicians. To minimize sampling bias in our small preselected population, randomization of survey recipients was used to make the two groups comparable. Despite moderate response rates, the rapid turnaround time could make e-mail the superior method for eliciting data in the future as more and more geriatric chiefs access electronic mail accounts. In tune with earlier findings, the electronic mail response rate for our survey was comparatively lower. We conclude that, even with this limitation, e-mail should be the preferred method if a prompt response is a primary goal. There may also be better control over the respondents and quality of the data with e-mail. Especially if traditional postal mailing is used as a salvage step, the e-mail/web-based survey follow-up reminders were easier and more cost-effective. The cost saving associated with electronic surveys must be weighed against the poorer expected response rate.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: The goal of this project was to examine the factors related to the high level of voter turnout among older adults and how these factors have changed across the past 50 years. The study builds on previous research efforts by combining individual level analyses from three nationally representative surveys. Design and Methods: We examined voter turnout among older citizens using the American National Election Studies (ANES) 1952–1996, the Current Population Studies (CPS) 1972–1996, and the General Social Surveys (GSS) 1972–1996. Logit regression identified significant factors that contribute to or detract from voting in presidential elections. Results: Included in the extensive results, we found that being married, attending church, and contact by political operatives (since the 1980 election) contributed positively to older voters' turnout, whereas living in the South was a negative predictor. Implications: Triangulating data sources, we are able to utilize the strengths of each study—providing an overview of the determinants of voter turnout and understanding of the changes related to older Americans' turnout in presidential elections.   Voting behaviors ,  Presidential elections ,  Political participation Decision Editor: Laurence G. Branch, PhDThe increasing number of older adults relative to younger adults participating in the political arena makes the elderly population an ever-growing important voting block, as witnessed in the many appeals that presidential candidates made to older voters during the 2000 election. As the number of elders grows in American society, it becomes increasingly important that we better understand their patterns of voter turnout and the factors contributing to their involvement in electoral politics (Rollenhagen 1984   ). Indeed, the political rhetoric of today clearly suggests that older voters are essential for either party to win an election. The candidates' focus on Medicare and Social Security indicates politicians' beliefs that they must carry the "senior" vote to win any election (Alwin 1998   ; Bazargan, Barbre, and Torres-Gil 1992   ; Binstock 1997b   , Binstock 1983   , Binstock 2000   ; Cornman and Kingson 1996   ; Jirovec and Erich 1995   ; Williamson 1998   ). Yet, we have limited understanding about the factors causing the comparatively high levels of voter turnout among older voters. We know even less about how (or even if) these factors have changed over time or why turnout among older adults rises and falls in different presidential election cycles. In the present study, we begin to answer these questions by combining analyses of voter turnout from three nationally representative surveys extending over a time period of more than 50 years of presidential elections. Our goal was to explain the factors related to voter turnout of older adults as well as to examine how (or if) these factors have changed over time. Importance of the "Senior Vote" Binstock 2000    suggests three primary reasons why political leaders focus so much attention on issues they believe to be important to older adults. First, those over 65 years of age compose a "substantial proportion of voting-age Americans today" (p. 18). This relative percentage will continue to grow throughout the first half of this century. Secondly, older adults have voted at higher rates than other age groups in the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. In fact, the voting rate for younger cohorts has declined, whereas that of older adults has increased slightly (Miller and Shanks 1996   ). The final factor is the assumption that politicians can control older voters by focusing on "old-age policies" and that they cannot win without the "senior vote." Torres-Gil 1992    concurs that these factors have increased political notice of older voters. In addition, he contends that the recognition of older adults as an "identity group" and the growing numbers of age-based organizations that have developed in recent years contribute significantly to the attention paid to potential older voters in recent elections. In coming presidential elections, because of the continued growth of the older population, basic issues related to economic and policy decisions such as long-term care, the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, intergenerational transfers, health insurance coverage, and support for caregivers of older adults will become even more prevalent in political debate and in the elections themselves. Politicians' efforts to win the senior vote without alienating younger voters will become even more intense. The rationale many politicians, journalists, academicians, and others use to emphasize the importance of the senior voting block is explained through what Binstock 1997b   , Binstock 2000    calls the Senior Power Model. The Senior Power Model The basis for this framework is the continuing numeric and proportional growth of individuals over the age of 65 years (Binstock 2000   ; Cornman and Kingson 1996   ). In addition, many political operators assume that all older adults are more politically active than their younger counterparts (Bazargan, Kang, and Bazargan 1991   ; Hudson 1999   ; Quadagno 1989   ). Further, those guiding political campaigns believe that older voters are only motivated to vote by issues directly impacting their lives, such as Medicare, Social Security, and such (Binstock 1997a   , Binstock 1997b   , Binstock 2000   ; Hudson 1999   ; Quadagno 1989   ). These assumptions lead to the conclusion that older adults are a homogeneous, self-focused group wielding tremendous political power. Thus, with each local and national election, politicians focus a great deal of time and energy on issues they believe will guarantee them the senior voting block.These assumptions have contributed to fears among younger adults, resulting in recommendations derived from what some have called intergenerational warfare. Fear of a loss of generational equity has brought forth terms such as "greedy geezers" (Fairlie 1988   ). Smith 1992    suggested that "the tyranny of America's old" is "one of the most crucial issues facing U.S. society" (p. 68). Policy recommendations have included disenfranchising retired persons and adults over the age of 70; providing parents of minor children with an additional vote for each dependent child; and giving working taxpayers two votes compared to older, retired voters (Binstock 2000   ).Binstock 1983   , Binstock 1992   , Binstock 1997a   , Binstock 2000    and others (e.g., Jirovec and Erich 1995   ; Torres-Gil 1992   ) contend that many of the assumptions forming the very basis of the concept of "senior power" are erroneous. Although the relative proportion of older adults is indeed growing rapidly, the diversity of these elders prevents them from voting as a unified block. Further, empirical efforts have failed to support the assumption that the majority of older voters cast their votes based on their own self-interest (Binstock 1997a   , Binstock 1997b   ). Nevertheless, one aspect of the senior power model does appear valid: the steady or growing rates of voter turnout among elders. As  Fig. 1  demonstrates, over the past several Presidential election cycles, voter turnout rates of the older population, defined by the Federal Election Commission as people over 65 years of age, have grown slightly since the 1970s, whereas the turnout rates of other age groups have remained stagnant or declined (see  Table Aa  , Note 1).A close examination of  Fig. 1  suggests a possible cohort effect for the group of individuals 45 to 64 years of age in 1976 who have continued to vote as they aged past 65 years, a possibility proposed by Miller and Shanks 1996   . In addition, the 45–64-year-old group remains the largest voting age group from 1976 through 1984. It remains at a consistent level until 1996, when it declines slightly. This observation might suggest that voting behavior is a developmental issue in that individuals move into a more active political role as they negotiate midlife transitions. Regardless of the cause, the figure clearly shows that over the last 20 years individuals 45 years of age and older have voted at a higher rate than those under the age of 45 years, and in more recent elections those 65 years of age and older have voted at a higher rate than any other age group. Voting Behaviors Because registration requirements and suffrage laws became more lenient in the decades since the 1950s ( Table Aa  , Note 2), and because of the overall increase in educational levels of the American electorate, many political scholars expected voter turnout to increase in the latter half of the 20th century. The overall decline in voter turnout rates from a high in 1960 of approximately 65% to the low of 49% in the 1996 presidential election, has produced much research attempting to explain this "puzzle of participation" (e.g., Brody 1978   ; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; Teixeira 1992   ). Teixeira 1992    argues that socioeconomic and educational upgrading of the general population has actually prevented the turnout decline from falling even further. He argues that "a substantial decline in social connectedness, as manifested in a younger, less married, and less church-going electorate; and a generalized withdrawal from the political world, as manifested by declining psychological involvement in politics and a declining belief in government responsiveness" (p. 49) has contributed to over one third of the turnout decline witnessed since the 1960s.Teixeira 1992    conclusions about declining voting rates resulting from social disconnectedness are theoretically consistent with Cumming and Henry 1961    social theory of aging called "disengagement theory." Cumming and Henry proposed that aging itself was both an individual and a social process. They contend that older adults' voting rates should be declining (as Teixeira 1992    suggests younger voting rates are) because adaptively aging adults should decrease rather than increase their involvement in all social and political arenas, including voting. The increasing voting rates of older adults, especially when controlling for differences in education and income (Rollenhagen 1984   ; Williamson 1998   ), add to empirical evidence (Hochschild 1975   ) that disengagement may not be appropriate as a theoretical basis upon which to understand the later years of life for a majority of older adults today.Rosenstone and Hansen 1993    "mobilization theory" of voter participation contends that the main culprit for the decline in voter turnout in the later half of the 20th century was the steady decline of recruitment efforts from political parties and political candidates. Yet, voter turnout among older voters has remained relatively high in spite of the changes in the general electorate (MacManus 2000   ).None of the explanations used to explain voter turnout among the general population seems to fully explain the voting rates of older adults. The number and variation of factors found to be catalysts or deterrents of voter turnout are vast (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995   ). Our goal in this project was to map the individual level determinants of voter turnout among elders and to examine if and how these factors changed over time. In order to accomplish our goal, we identified existing nationally representative data sets that provided us with breadth and continuity across several presidential election cycles. Theoretical Foundations Growing interest among gerontologists in the political activity of older Americans has resulted in a spate of research investigating the causes of turnout among this growing segment of the American electorate. In fact, the growing importance of studying political activity among elders has given rise to a surprisingly sophisticated and rich literature uncovering the causes of voter turnout among this group of Americans. The theoretical framework for the vast majority of prior work on voter turnout has been the rational actor model, or the theory of rational choice (Downs 1957   ). Central to this framework is the recognition that the decision to vote, at least for most citizens, is a marginal (low cost/low benefit) action (Aldrich 1993   ; Jackman 1993   ). Consequently, answering the question of "who votes?" has generally focused on factors that increase or decrease the costs of voting (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ). In their work contributing to the mobilization theory of political participation, Verba and colleagues 1995    argue that the factors increasing or decreasing those costs are divided into three broad categories: resources (ability to vote), psychology (desire to vote), and recruitment (were you asked to vote). Resources and demographic variables influencing turnout include income, education, state and region of residence, and being a minority (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ). Internal and external political efficacies are among the psychological factors reported to be influential in determining voting behaviors. Internal political efficacy refers to the degree to which potential voters feel capable of understanding politics. External efficacy is the degree to which they believe the political powers care about their personal attitudes and needs (Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes 1960   ). Recruitment and mobilization may come through formal or informal networks at work, religious institutions, or political organizations. Rosenstone and Hansen 1993    take a similar approach, dividing the factors that affect participation into "individual influences" and "political influences." Individual influences are represented by personal costs and resources (the demands that participation makes on one's "money, time, skill, knowledge, and self-confidence"), which interact with personal rewards, interests, and beliefs regarding participation. Although these help predict which people participate, political influences—social networks and strategic mobilization efforts—help predict when they participate. Age and Voter Turnout: Linear or Nonlinear Relationship? Previous work has increased the understanding of the importance of these factors as determinants of turnout among older voters. Binstock 1983   , Binstock 1997b   , Binstock 2000    has written extensively on this subject and argues that while the older population may be voting at higher rates than other age or demographic groups, they are not the monolithic, homogeneous, self-interested voting block often suggested by the popular conventional wisdom expressed in the Senior Power Model. In addition, MacManus 1996   , MacManus 2000    describes in detail the voter turnout rates of America's elders and proposes several possible reasons for their comparatively high rates of turnout (see also Alwin 1998   ; Glenn and Grimes 1968   ; MacManus and Tenpas 1998   ; Williamson 1998   ;  Table Aa  , Note 3). Several studies have argued that, once controls are made for socioeconomic factors such as the often lower educational levels of older citizens, the probability of voter turnout consistently increases with age up to the late 50s or early 60s, then continues to increase but at slower rates (Campbell 1971   ; Converse and Niemi 1971   ; Curtis and Lambert 1976   ; Glenn and Grimes 1968   ; Gubrium 1972   ; Jirovec and Erich 1992   ; Nie, Verba, and Kim 1974   ; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; but see Jennings and Markus 1988   ; Strate, Parrish, Elder, and Ford 1989   ;  Table Aa  , Note 4).In general, there are three main hypotheses accounting for the relationships between age and political participation. The life-experience hypothesis suggests that, as people age, they acquire resources and have learning experiences that promote participation (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; Strate et al. 1989   ). Second, proponents of the life-cycle hypothesis argue that young citizens are less likely to vote because they lack the community involvement necessary to believe that politics is an important endeavor. In addition, the life-cycle hypothesis suggests that there will be a gradual decrease of political and social involvement among the oldest voters as physical limitations begin to increase and intensify (Cumming and Henry 1961   ; Milbrath and Goel 1977   ; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ). The disengagement social theory of aging (Cumming and Henry 1961   ) contends that such withdrawal is not only due to physical limitations but that it is required by society at large in order to support the well-being of society as well as that of older adults themselves. Disengagement theory contends that elders must step aside and remove themselves from social and political activity as they age so that the younger generation can take over the primary determining roles within the family and within society as a whole. Finally, proponents of the generational hypothesis suggest that socializing experiences influence each generation differently, and these generational experiences have helped explain the gradual decline in national voter turnout rates since the 1960s (Lyons and Alexander 2000   ; Miller 1992   ). For example, older women may vote less because they were socialized before the 19th amendment permitted women to vote (Firebaugh and Chen 1995   ). Similarly, young people today may vote less because they did not experience the politically turbulent events of the Great Depression or the World Wars (Miller 1992   ; Miller and Shanks 1996   ).Although each perspective has some face validity, Rosenstone and Hansen have recently presented evidence that supports the life-experience hypothesis. As they argue (1993, p. 140)[our] evidence strongly favors the life-experience hypotheses… the relationship between age and electoral participation definitely persists even when life-cycle and cohort effects have been taken into account … consistent with the life-experience explanation, participation in electoral politics increases throughout life… Correspondingly, the findings offer little support for either the generational or the life-cycle hypotheses (emphasis added).Further evidence comes from gerontological studies examining voter turnout exclusively among older adults. For example, according to Bazargan and colleagues 1991   (p. 18) "Although middle-aged citizens appear to vote at higher rates than older adults, once other demographic variables have been held constant, aging itself produces not a decline but an increase in turnout. The rate of increase in voting begins to level off at around age fifty-five, but turnout continues to rise. This rise in voter turnout, however, occurs at an increasingly slower pace through the seventies." Further, Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980    suggest that once education, gender, and marital status have been held constant, the rate of turnout actually increases with age (see also, Campbell et al. 1960   ; Glenn and Grimes 1968   ). Conversely, Bazargan and coworkers 1991    find that, given controls for socioeconomic factors, age was not even a significant predictor of turnout—at least among their comparatively small sample of older women. Decline in Turnout Since the Late 1950s Turnout has been found to be strongly and positively related to the resources of education and income, as well as to employment, which can represent connections to society, financial rewards, and recruitment networks (Cassel and Hill 1981   ; Leighley and Nagler 1992a   , Leighley and Nagler 1992b   ; Miller and Shanks 1996   ; Shaffer 1981   ; Teixeira 1987   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ). Psychological factors are also clearly important in the decision to vote. In particular, the decline in voter turnout witnessed since the 1960s has been attributed, in large part, to declining levels of political interest and efficacy (Teixeira 1987   , Teixeira 1992   ). These factors have also been found to be predictors of turnout among the older population, along with measures of partisan affiliation and trust in government (Bazargan et al. 1992   ; Firebaugh and Chen 1995   ; Glenn and Grimes 1968   ; Kam, Cheung, Chan, and Leung 1999   ; Peterson and Somit 1994   ). Employment and marital status also predict voter turnout, which may reflect a combination of resource, recruitment, and psychological factors (Leighley and Nagler 1992a   , Leighley and Nagler 1992b   ; Miller and Shanks 1996   ; Stoker and Jennings 1995   ; Teixeira 1987   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ). Bazargan and colleagues 1991    and Peterson and Somit 1992, 1994) demonstrate the importance of marriage as a catalyst of turnout among older voters by showing that older adults were less likely to vote once they became single, either through death or divorce.Despite the benefits, both material and psychological, associated with being employed (Quadagno and Hardy 1996   ), few studies have examined the impact of employment on the voter turnout of older adults. Nevertheless, several studies have identified increased education and church attendance as important predictors of older voter turnout (Bazargan et al. 1991   , Bazargan et al. 1992   ; Jirovec and Erich 1995   ; Peterson and Somit 1992   , Peterson and Somit 1994   ). Some studies of older voter turnout suggest that there are significant differences between men and women (Curtis and Lambert 1976   ; Hudson and Gonyea 1990   ; Jirovec and Erich 1995   ; Peterson and Somit 1992   , Peterson and Somit 1994   ; Nie et al. 1974   ) as well as between Caucasians and African Americans (Bazargan et al. 1991   , Bazargan et al. 1992   ; Peterson and Somit 1992   , Peterson and Somit 1994   ; Powell and Thorson 1990   ). General studies of voter turnout have long found significantly lower probabilities of voter turnout among residents of the southern states (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ), but such regional variations have rarely been included (Lyons and Alexander 2000   ) in prior analyses of older voter turnout. Several studies have investigated the importance of subjective evaluations of personal health status but have reached different conclusions. For example, Peterson and Somit 1994    find mixed evidence of the impact of health on a number of attitudinal and behavioral measures. Similarly, Kam and associates 1999    find mixed results for various measures of health status on an index of political participation. In addition, Jirovec and Erich 1992    find no significant impact of health status on voting, given controls for other variables such as income and education. Bazargan and colleagues 1992    find evidence that the zero-order correlation between health status and voter turnout among older African Americans may become insignificant after controlling for other socioeconomic factors. Nevertheless, Bazargan and coworkers 1991    found that health status was a significant predictor of turnout among Caucasians.Finally, despite the importance of the mobilization theory of voter turnout, few studies have examined the role of elite mobilization efforts on the turnout of older people. Kam and colleagues 1999    find that candidate and party recruitment are significant factors in the political participation of older adults living in Hong Kong. Further, Hudson and Gonyea 1990    argue that recent changes in several senior political organizations indicate that political groups have begun to realize the importance of mobilizing and addressing the specific needs of older women. Finally, MacManus 1996    reports evidence that candidates and political parties strategically contact "likely" voters, such as the wealthy, educated, and elderly (Lyons and Alexander 2000   ; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ). Whether or not candidate or party contact has had a significant impact on the voter turnout of American elders over time, or if there is a significant impact controlling for other relevant factors, remains to be seen. In this regard, nearly all prior research examining voter turnout among older adults has been based on small samples or single cross-sectional surveys. The extent to which the findings hold up across election years and data sets, if the impacts persist or change, or if the influence disappears given the addition of new controls introduced in this study (such as party recruitment and living in the South), are open questions. Methods The Current Population Survey The Current Population Survey (CPS; 1972–1996) involves a monthly household telephone survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized American population, it provides a comprehensive body of information on the employment and unemployment experiences of the U.S. population, classified by age, sex, race, and a variety of other characteristics. The CPS is a large-scale survey for which the data are collected by face-to-face and telephone interviews of more than 60,000 households. The CPS contains only measures of respondents' socioeconomic backgrounds such as education and income levels. Following every national election, the CPS contains a "voter supplement" that also asks respondents if they voted in the presidential election. The strength of the CPS is the sample size, which includes thousands of older voters in every presidential election from 1972 through 1996. The American National Election Studies The American National Election Studies (ANES; 1952–1996) are national surveys conducted by the Center for Political Studies of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Data collection began in 1952 and continues to the present. The surveys are based on multistage representative cross-sectional samples of citizens of voting age, living in private households. Each study contains information from interviews conducted with 1,000 to 2,000 respondents. The samples are representative of the four major regions (Northeast, North Central, South, and West) of the contiguous United States as defined by the Census Bureau. The strength of the ANES is the wide range of politically relevant variables for predicting voter turnout. While the ANES does not include measures of physical health, it does include political attitudes such as whether or not one believes the presidential race will be close; whether one cares about the outcome of the presidential race; an individual's overall interest in politics; retrospective evaluations of personal financial situations; whether or not political parties or candidates attempted to contact them during the campaign; and measures of both internal and external political efficacy. The General Social Survey The General Social Survey (GSS; 1972–1996) is an almost annual personal interview survey of U.S. households conducted by the National Opinion Research Center. The first survey took place in 1972. Although the GSS does not include as wide a range of politically relevant variables as the ANES, it does contain substantially more measures of political attitudes and positions than the CPS. In addition, the GSS is the only survey to include measures of subjective well-being. In fact, the GSS has consistently asked respondents questions about their current health status. However, the GSS has the drawback that respondents are sometimes not asked about voting in previous elections until several months after the election. Such time delays increase the potential for misreporting actual voting behavior. Nevertheless, some studies investigating the potential for biases when using reported measures of voter turnout rather than validated measures have found that while misreporting is a problem, it does not bias results dramatically. In fact, Katosh and Traugott 1981    and Sigelman 1982    argue that nearly all inferences based on reported voting behavior remain true when validated vote data are used. While the GSS has a substantially smaller sample size, the addition of some variables unavailable in the other data sets, specifically measures of health status, provide more certainty concerning the impact of other factors. While variables such as education, family income, and regional residence may play important roles in a purely demographic model, the findings may be misleading as the demographic variables may provide proxies for attitudinal differences across geographical areas. For example, a negative impact of living in the South could be the result of fewer people living in this area who maintain strong affiliations with the political parties rather than something more generally associated with the physical location. Analysis The analysis procedures for this study were limited to those in each data set over the age of 55 years (see  Table Aa  , Note 5). We begin the analysis by examining basic demographic changes among the older population over time. We constructed basic frequency tables to allow us to examine what demographic changes experienced by this group may be related to changes in the probabilities of voter turnout. For example, if older Americans are experiencing greater levels of family income, an outcome the Senior Power Model might lead us to believe, then the increasing levels of family income may not only increase the probability of voter turnout for the group overall, but also may have become a more important individual level predictor of turnout over time. Of course, the opposite could be true if older Americans are experiencing decreasing standards of living. In order to identify the individual level determinants of voter turnout, and if the impact of these factors changed over time, we estimated encompassing models of voter turnout including controls for all variables identified in prior research as important predictors of voter turnout (contingent upon availability across data sets). Because the dependent variable in our analysis, voter turnout, is dichotomous, we use logistic regression to conduct our multivariate analysis. Furthermore, we analyze each election year separately because pooling data across years requires strong assumptions "that the effects of demographic characteristics on turnout do not change from year to year" (Leighley and Nagler 1992b   , p. 725). If the impact of various factors does change from year to year, which is one of the primary questions raised in this study, then pooling the data set will result in biased and inconsistent estimates (Johnston 1984   ). For more in-depth discussions of the hazards of pooling data across presidential election years, see Green 2000    and  Table Aa  , Note 6. Demographic Changes In  Table 1  and  Table 2  we see that the senior population (defined here as those over 55 years of age) has experienced several changes relevant to voter turnout across the last several decades.According to both the CPS and the ANES, the number of elders living in the South has slightly increased, with just under one third in the CPS and slightly more than one third of all the elders in the ANES living in the southern part of the United States. According to the ANES, the number of older adults living in the South was at a peak during the 1960s and 1970s, when the percentage reached 38.6% during the election of 1976. There appears to be a slight increase in income across time as well as a consistent increase in educational attainment. The number of older African Americans in the electorate has increased slightly since the 1950s, but has remained relatively stable since the 1970s. Marriage rates have also remained relatively stable among the older electorate, and they reached their highest levels during the late 1950s and 1960s. The average age of the older population has grown consistently but only slightly from the mean of approximately 66.3 in the 1972 election to 68.2 in the 1996 presidential election (according to the CPS data). Perhaps the most dramatic changes have occurred in the levels of efficacy, voters' sense of their ability to make a difference or to understand the political process, among older voters and the number of elders who were contacted by a political candidate or party. Looking first at internal political efficacy, voters' belief that politics was not too complicated for them to understand, we see that the levels appear to change dramatically from election to election. For example, internal efficacy reached its lowest level in the 1996 presidential election, when only 34% of older voters displayed a sense of internal efficacy. Comparatively, in the election of 1984, 61% of older voters believed that they were able to understand political life. Similarly, levels of external political efficacy, the general belief among potential older voters that government is responsive to their needs and desires, have varied greatly, ranging from a high of 38% in 1960 to a low of 15% in 1980. It is interesting to note that the percentages of the older population with high feelings of external efficacy are relatively small, reflecting the general belief among the older population that government is not very responsive to their needs and desires. Results As shown in  Table 3  , the analysis of the CPS data sets reveals some interesting patterns. First, there is a significant, consistent, and negative coefficient associated with living in the South. Despite controls for other socioeconomic factors, southern elders had a significantly lower probability of voting in presidential elections between 1972 and 1996. Nevertheless, the size of this coefficient is steadily decreasing from –.58 in 1972 to a low of –.27 in 1996. Being a participant in the labor force and increased levels of educational attainment were associated with significantly greater probabilities of turnout—although the marginal impact of being in the labor force appears to be declining from a high of .41 in 1972 to a low of .15 in 1996. Increased levels of family income, as well as additional increases in age, were associated with an increased probability of voting. Although the influence of age appears relatively stable, the marginal effect of income indicates an increasing impact from a low of .05 in 1976 to a high of about .10 in 1988. Further, while the predicted probability of voting increases with age, the increase significantly attenuates at the oldest age levels (represented by the significant and negative age-squared coefficients). Once controls are made for the generally lower socioeconomic standing (e.g., lower educational attainment, lower income levels, etc.), older African Americans were significantly more likely to vote than similarly situated older Caucasians. In addition, the impact of being an African American appears to be increasing from a low marginal impact of .07 in 1972 to a high of .52 in 1996. Finally, the impact of marriage is significant and positive whereas there appear to be no significant differences between older men and women once we control for socioeconomic factors.The analysis of the ANES data set reveals that once controls are made for socioeconomic standing and political attitudes, older African Americans were less likely to vote in the early presidential election years of the 1950s and early 1960s (see  Table 4  ). This pattern is likely the result of Jim Crow laws and Black Codes preventing African Americans in the South from voting until the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1965. The impact of education, while not significant in some of the years, has a positive and significant impact on the probability of turnout in 7 of the 12 elections. Once controls are made for political attitudes, such as "Do you care about the outcome of the presidential election," the impact of family income among elders also appears to be a nonsignificant predictor until the 1996 election. Concerning the impact of age, we find that the coefficients attached to both the age and the age-squared term are consistently in the same direction as the findings from the CPS, but they do not reach statistical significance in most of the presidential elections.As in the CPS, living in the South is associated with a significantly lower probability of voting in presidential elections among elders. Despite the substantial number of attitudinal, economic, and demographic controls, there is a reoccurring difference between elders living in the South compared to older adults anywhere else in the nation. The increased migration of the older population into the South has apparently not altered this phenomenon. As found in the CPS, there appear to be few years with significant differences between older men and women when controlling for the other factors included in the model. A relatively consistent finding from the ANES data is the significant positive impact of being interested in politics. Alternatively, the strength of the respondent's partisanship is a significant positive predictor in only 2 of the 12 presidential elections included in the analysis. As in prior research including voters of all ages, the impact of church attendance is generally a consistent and positive predictor of voter turnout among elders ( Table Aa  , Note 7). The impact of candidate and party recruitment has a significant and positive impact on the probability of voting in every election after the 1976 presidential election. Finally, external political efficacy apparently has no consistent impact on the probability of turnout among older voters. The impact of internal efficacy consistently has a positive sign but only reaches statistical significance in 4 of the 12 elections. Table 5  presents the results from the analysis of the GSS that reveal very similar patterns. Again, we see the consistent and substantial positive impact of education and the negative impact of living in the South (although the impact of living in the South does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance as consistently as in the analysis of the CPS or the ANES data sets). The impact of church attendance was positive and significant in every election. There appear to be few years when there were significant differences between men and women. The patterns associated with the age and age-squared terms show the standard directional impact as found in our analysis of the CPS data but, like the findings from the ANES, once controls are made for political attitudes, the variables do not reach statistical significance in this analysis. The number of people living in the home is not a consistently significant variable. Finally, poor health is a significant deterrent in only four of the seven elections. Apparently, there are factors in some elections that make it worth the struggle for elders in poor health to vote. This finding could be related to the mobilization by political operatives in some elections who encourage high voter turnout among supporters by providing transportation or facilitating absentee voting for elders with health conditions that make it difficult to go to the polls. Promising areas of future research concern disentangling the contextual factors that help elders overcome the deterrent effects of poor health (e.g., candidate issue positions and appeals, mobilization efforts, close elections) and under what circumstances such factors have their greatest impact and among whom they have that impact. Discussion In general, the analyses from all three data sets reveal similar findings.  Table 6  presents the variables in each data set that were significant in at least a majority of the elections. The findings seem clear regarding the negative impact of living in the South, the positive impact of education, and the positive impact of church attendance. Although the findings from the CPS suggest that there are significant relationships between voter turnout and marriage, income, and being an African American, the findings from the ANES and the GSS suggest that once controls are made for political attitudes such as interest in politics, behaviors such as church attendance, and political factors such as being recruited, some of the relationships found in the analysis of the CPS disappear. Nevertheless, despite numerous controls, these analyses support the notion that there is a fundamental difference in the turnout patterns of older voters living in the South, those who attend church regularly, those who are more highly educated, and those who have been explicitly recruited or mobilized into political life through contact by political parties or candidates (see also MacManus 2000   ).Although the impact of education is consistently significant in the analyses of the GSS and the CPS data sets, its significance fluctuates in the findings from the ANES. In fact, the impact of education is not significant at conventional levels in five of the years included in the ANES. Prior research focusing on the overall population has created the conventional wisdom that education is the primary predictor of voter turnout in the United States (Verba, Nie, and Kim 1978   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ). The findings of this study support the general conclusion that education is an important factor in determining voter turnout but also suggests that, among older adults, other factors may be stronger and more consistent determinants of voter turnout. In fact, while educational attainment is an important predictor of voter turnout among elders included in these surveys, it is neither the strongest nor the most consistent finding. Similarly, controlling for other factors, the impact of family income among the older population is also less important than found in previous research.There were only a few years with significant differences between older men and women, controlling for the other factors included in the models. A relatively consistent finding in the analysis of the ANES data is the significant positive impact of being interested in politics and the importance of being contacted by a political party or candidates. These findings imply that as older adults continue to become a larger part of the eligible electorate, candidates and political elites may attempt to relate and address relevant issues in ways that render politics more interesting to older citizens. The result may be an increase in the number of older adults who are interested in political life and are therefore more likely to vote. Nevertheless, this outcome may depend on the willingness of political activists to actually mobilize and recruit older voters.Prior research suggests that the strength of partisanship should be a consistent predictor of those who are likely to vote, but among the elders in the ANES and GSS surveys it is generally not significant once controls are made for other demographic, economic, and attitudinal factors. In comparison, the impact of candidate and party recruitment has a significant positive impact on the probability of voting in every election after the 1980 presidential election. Prior investigations examining changes in candidate and party recruitment among the general population have shown that the overall number of candidate and party recruitment efforts increased during the presidential election years occurring in the 1950s and 1960s, then fluctuated during the 1970s, and then fell substantially during the 1980s (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ). Nevertheless, the marginal impact of recruitment among older people is one of the strongest predictors of voter turnout after the 1980s. In other words, while candidates and parties may be currently recruiting fewer people compared to the 1950s and 1960s when political parties had much greater organizational strength (Beck and Sorauf 1992   ), the effectiveness of these recruitment efforts, at least among senior voters, has apparently increased.External political efficacy apparently has no consistent impact on the probability of turnout among the older population. However, the impact of internal efficacy more regularly has a positive sign but only reaches statistical significance in four of the elections included in the ANES. Although some prior research (examining the entire population) suggests that a loss of political efficacy is one of the main reasons voter turnout has declined since the 1960s (Teixeira 1992   ), political efficacy, both internal and external, does not seem to play a consistent role in the individual level determinants of voter turnout among the nation's elderly population.Contrary to the Senior Power Model, which suggests that older Americans are a self-interested voting block with ever increasing political strength evidenced by their increasing levels of turnout, our analysis suggests that elders are far from the image of a monolithic voting juggernaut. In fact, our analysis suggests that over the past 50 years the older population has experienced declining levels of political efficacy, substantially reduced incomes during the 1980s, lower marriage rates, increased percentages of minority population, and greater percentages of elders living in southern states. All of these trends suggest increased heterogeneity of the senior voting block and reduced turnout rates. Our analyses also suggest that these deterrent factors have been offset by the increased levels of education, income (during the 70s and 90s), interest in political affairs, and mobilization/recruitment efforts by political activists. Far from the stereotype created by the Senior Power Model, older adults are experiencing lower levels of both internal and external political efficacy and, according to the analysis of the ANES and CPS data, those living in the South are generally much less likely to vote than their peers living elsewhere.Overall, the findings of this study seriously question the applicability of the Senior Power Model. In fact, Binstock's contention (1983, 2000) that older adults are a more heterogeneous group than many think is supported by the findings of this study. The fact that neither external nor internal efficacy were consistently significant in predicting voter turnout suggests that elders do not perceive themselves to be a "power block" that can make a difference in the outcome of a presidential election. Again, it is important to note that the percentages of the older population with high feelings of external efficacy are relatively small, reflecting the general belief among the senior community that government is not very responsive to their needs and desires. Further, the behaviors of elders living in the South appear to be anything but "senior power." In fact, it has long been noted that legal, institutional, and cultural factors in the South have been deterrents to voter turnout (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993   ; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980   ), and the overall voting rates among older adults may primarily rest on the changing political environment of the South.Nevertheless, with the continuing substantial growth of the older population and the number of advocacy and mobilization groups, older voters may continue to gain more political power at the ballot box. The growth of political advocacy and mobilization groups in the past three decades has been phenomenal. Three types of age-based groups have developed (Torres-Gil 1992   ), and the organizations represented by these groups are numerous. The following list includes a only small representation of each type. The three types of groups include mass membership groups such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Older Women's League (OWL); professional organizations composed of scholars and practitioners focused on issues related to aging such as The Gerontological Society of America (GSA), the American Society on Aging (ASA), and the Gerontological Health Section of the American Public Health Association; and public interest organizations and agencies that reflect concerns for older adults and related service providers such as the Alzheimer's Association, the National Arthritis Foundation, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (NAAAA), the National Association of State Units on Aging (NASUA), and the National Coalition of Aging Groups. However, because of the heterogeneity of older Americans in education, health, income, and such, even these organizations together cannot create a monofocused mobilizing group with the power to elect public officials based on candidates' support of specific policies relative to older adults (Binstock 1997a   , Binstock 2000   ). Thus, as with younger voters, these organizations may contribute to determining when older adults vote but not necessarily how.Whether or not the Senior Power Model has any validity, and if the voting behaviors of older adults are tied to the mobilization of these voters by political operatives, older voters will remain an important segment of the voting population whom researchers cannot ignore. In fact, a full understanding of voter turnout in contemporary American democracy, as well as a full understanding of the civic lives of elders in the United States, will remain incomplete without many more investigations into the political behavior of older Americans. Particularly productive investigations will focus on disentangling the contextual factors that help elders overcome the deterrent effects of poor health (e.g., candidate issue positions and appeals, mobilization efforts, close elections) and under what circumstances such factors have their greatest impact and among whom that impact is realized.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Abstract Purpose: This study sought to determine the effects of nursing home placement (NHP) for patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared to maintaining community placement, on changes in family caregiver health and well-being over time. Design and Methods: We utilized a 2-year, longitudinal study with one baseline and four follow-up assessments for patients' spouses, adult offspring, and in-laws (married to offspring). Families were recruited from eight clinical outpatient centers, supported by the State of California, and followed in the community over time. A multidisciplinary clinical evaluation was undertaken by the centers, and follow-up assessments included questionnaire and interview data. Results: Family caregiver health and well-being did not improve over time following NHP, and there were no significant differences in health and well-being between family caregivers who placed their ill elder in a nursing home and those who kept the elder at home or in the community. However, female family caregivers and spouses displayed greater declines in health and well-being over time, compared to other family caregivers, regardless of whether or not NHP occurred. Implications: Families considering NHP need to be advised of what may and may not change following NHP. In particular, spouses and female family caregivers may not experience those changes in life satisfaction and well-being that are hoped for. Variation in the effects of NHP may be more related to pre-NHP family processes and relationships than to the severity of the patient's disability, caregiver strain, patient and caregiver demographics, and use of community-based professional services.   Alzheimer's disease ,  Dementia ,  Placement ,  Caregiver burden Decision Editor: Eleanor S. McConnell, RN, PhDThe considerable burdens of caring for an elder with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been well documented (Schulz, Visintainer, and Williamson 1990   ). The variety of programs (day care services, respite care, support groups) developed to mitigate such burdens are based on the assumption that the longer a family can manage the patient in the community without undue burden, the better the patient care and the longer the delay of nursing home placement (NHP). However, because dementia is a progressively debilitating disease, at some point in the course of the disease many health care professionals suggest that the family consider NHP. The assumption by both professionals and caregivers alike is that NHP will relieve family caregivers from many of the stressful and repetitive instrumental and emotional burdens of caring for a demented elder in the community.Although there is general agreement about the advisability of NHP at some point during the course of the disease, surprisingly little is known about the subsequent effects of NHP on caregiver health and well-being. Does caregiver health and well-being improve after NHP, and, if so, are these improvements uniform among family members and across families?Knowing more about the effects of NHP can help families consider this very difficult question in two important ways. First, in most cases, family members need to incorporate into their deliberations appropriate expectations about what will occur after NHP. If certain factors are not expected to change after NHP, families might alter their placement decision. Second, it is important for health care professionals to prepare family members for the instrumental and emotional changes that may or may not occur following NHP. Information provided by health care professionals prior to NHP can reduce later personal disappointment or surprise, and may mitigate the emotional sequella associated with "second guessing" the decision after NHP has taken place.Despite the importance of NHP to families caring for a patient with dementia, there is only a limited empirical base to guide health care professionals and families through the decision-making process. This study addressed one aspect of this problem by evaluating family caregiver health and well-being over a 2-year period following NHP. Background In general, findings from cross-sectional research do not unambiguously support the hypothesis that caregiver health and well-being improve following NHP. For example, Barber 1993    found few differences in stress levels between spouses caring for patients with AD at home and those who had placed their ill elders in nursing homes. Ritchie and Ledesert 1992    reported that one year after NHP, one third of family caregivers expressed considerable distress, regardless of level of patient dementia, other associated patient pathology, and recency of admission. Zarit and Whitlatch 1992    reported that relatives who placed their ill elder in a nursing home experienced lower instrumental overload and tension than relatives who decided against NHP, but other indicators of stress, such as level of depression, did not change. Other reports (Novak and Guest 1992   ) have indicated that the caregiver's relationship to the patient qualified the linkages between NHP and changes in caregiver health and well-being, such that spouses generally experienced the greatest demoralization, compared to adult offspring and other family members.With respect to longitudinal research, a study of a large community sample (Aneshensel and Pearlin 1993   ) found that NHP reduced family caregiver experience of being bound to the caregiver role (role captivity). King and Collins 1991    studied family caregivers' sense of general well-being and depression before and after NHP. Health and financial stresses were reduced following NHP for spouses, but stress increased for the patient's adult offspring. However, Pushkar, Gold, and Reis 1995    reported that caregivers' health and quality of life improved in families that decided on NHP, compared to those who kept the patient at home.In general, both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest similar findings. Studies focusing on caregiver instrumental burden show notable improvement following NHP. In contrast, studies focusing on caregiver health, well-being, depression, and life satisfaction indicate little change following NHP, although there is some variability of findings from study to study. It is not clear, however, whether the findings from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies can be easily generalized to the large population of families that care for patients with dementia, or whether qualifications based on family caregiver gender, social class, position in the family, and such need to be taken into consideration. It may be that the lack of change in caregiver health and well-being following NHP may be accounted for, at least in part, by other caregiver, patient, and family factors that are not generally included in published research. Factors That May Influence Change Following NHP Three groups of factors have been shown to affect a variety of processes and outcomes in the management of frail elders, such as caregiver health and well-being (Lieberman and Fisher 1995a   ), amount of family help provided (Lieberman and Fisher 1999a   ), effect of caregiving on second-generation marriages (Lieberman and Fisher 1999b   ), utilization of community-based professional services (Lieberman and Fisher 1998   ), and decisions to institutionalize (Fisher and Lieberman 1999   ). The three groups of factors are: (1) demographic characteristics of the patient and caregivers, including age, relation to the patient, gender, income, and education (Branch and Jette 1982   ; Christenson and Moore 1994   ; Hogan, Thierer, Ebley, and Parhad 1994   ; Pruchno, Michaels, and Potashnik 1990   ); (2) severity of patient functional deficit (Bianchetti, Scuratti, Zanetti, and Binetti 1995   ; Wackerbarth 1996   ); and (3) characteristics of the family caregiving setting, including level of caregiver stress and burden (Collins, King, and Kokinakis 1994   ; McCoy and Edwards 1981   ; Pruchno et al. 1990   ) and availability of community resources (Cohen, Gold, Shulman, and Wortley 1993   ; Scott, Edwards, Davis, Cornman, and Macera 1997   ). These three groups of factors provide a context for observing variations in the effects of NHP on family members.The central question of this research asked if NHP leads to improved family caregiver health and well-being over time. We studied the effects of institutionalization on several family members, not only the primary caregiver, who in this study was usually the spouse. We had previously shown that all family members' health and well-being were affected by the illness, that the marriages of adult offspring and in-laws were affected, and that the amount of formal and informal help utilized by the family was significantly related to family structure and dynamics (Fisher and Lieberman 1996   ; Lieberman and Fisher 1995a   , Lieberman and Fisher 1998   , Lieberman and Fisher 1999a   ).We explored how the three groups of factors (characteristics of the family caregiving setting, demographic characteristics of the patient and the caregivers, severity of patient functional deficit) qualified the relationship between NHP and changes in family member health and well-being over time. For example, among characteristics of the caregiving setting, we expected that families that used professional services prior to NHP would display greater improvements in caregiver health and well-being following NHP than families that did not, because the former group would have more comfort and experience relying on external sources for caregiving than the latter group (Lieberman and Fisher 1999a   ). Among demographic characteristics, we expected that spouses would display less improvement in health and well-being following NHP than adult offspring and other family members because of their more intimate emotional involvement with the patient over time. Finally, we expected that caregivers of patients with high functional deficit would experience a greater improvement in health and well-being following NHP than caregivers of other patients because of the differences in associated caregiver burden. Methods Families were recruited from eight university-based Alzheimer's centers, located in San Francisco, Davis, Fresno, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Irvine, California. Each center sees an average of 120 new patients yearly for comprehensive diagnostic and management/care planning, and most are followed for a yearly reevaluation. The centers' diagnostic procedures include neurological, family, medical, psychiatric, and social evaluation, as well as advanced diagnostic imaging procedures. The patient's behavior is evaluated during a home visit. A case conference is used to arrive at a consensus diagnosis and care plan, and family members attend a meeting for diagnostic and care recommendations following the case conference.Inclusion criteria for the study were: National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke diagnostic criteria for probable or possible Alzheimer's disease; at least one adult offspring residing in California; and the patient living in the community, either with a spouse, offspring, other relative, or alone. All patients and families meeting these criteria were referred by their respective clinic to the research team.Of the 533 families referred, 198 did not fully meet inclusion criteria; of the remaining 335 families, 100 refused to participate, yielding a 70% acceptance rate for contacted families. The final sample consisted of 235 families, which included 89 spouses, 184 offspring, and 136 in-laws (married to offspring). The sample self-identified as 87.8% Caucasian and 12.1% ethnic minorities (Hispanic, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander). Using the centers' shared, computerized database, comparisons between those families that refused participation and those that agreed to participate yielded no significant differences in center location, reasons for seeking evaluation, patient gender, ethnicity, marital status, living arrangements, income, education, number of primary and secondary caregivers, number of problems, degree of cognitive deficit, level of dementia, and decisions to institutionalize within 2 years of evaluation. The sample appeared representative of the population served by the centers.Patients were classified into two groups: those who were institutionalized within 6 months of clinic assessment (n = 47) and those who were not institutionalized for 2 years following clinic assessment (n = 135). Cases were omitted if the patient died within 2 years of evaluation (n = 13). To provide for sufficient post-NHP time to assess changes in caregiver health and well-being, cases also were omitted if the patient was institutionalized at the 12-, 18-, or 24-month follow-up (n = 40).  Table 1  and  Table 2  show patient and family member characteristics, respectively, for NHP and non-NHP cases. There was only one significant difference between patients and between family members in the NHP and the non-NHP groups among the variables listed in both  Table 1  and  Table 2  , a finding that could have resulted by chance, given the number of comparisons run: Family members in the NHP group reported significantly more patient troubling behaviors than family members in the non-NHP group (t = 3.13, p = .02). Procedure Following referral to the research team, the patient's spouse was contacted first, followed by the offspring "most involved in care," as assessed by the centers. "Caregiver" was defined as family members who provided activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental (IADLs) care. After recruiting the spouse and offspring, an in-law, not married to the selected offspring, was recruited. A 197-item questionnaire was mailed to each family respondent (a maximum of three: spouse, offspring, in-law). Every 6 months for 2 years following initial clinic evaluation, each family respondent was contacted and asked to complete a brief questionnaire and telephone interview. Outcome Measures Our primary goal was to evaluate the effect of NHP on family caregiver health and well-being over time. Three measures of health and well-being were included. First, a scale of common physical symptoms, derived from the Rand MOS (Ware et al. 1984   ), was used to assess common somatic complaints (headache, backache) that occurred regularly over the last 3 months (21 items, alpha = .93). Second, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (Derogatis 1974   ), modified by Pearlin and Lieberman 1978   , was used to assess anxiety and depression (23 items, alpha = .92). Third, the Well-Being Scale (Bradburn 1969   ) was used to assess general well-being (11 items, alpha =.94). Each of these scales was used in the multiple regression analyses reported below. In addition, we also constructed a single composite score for use in the mixed model analysis so that we could keep the number of comparisons to a minimum. Moderator Variables Demographic Characteristics. Caregiver gender, education (number of years of formal schooling), relationship to the patient (spouse, offspring, in-law), and the number of caregiving hours per week were assessed. Income was not included because of its high correlation with education (r = .66). Severity of Patient Deficit. Six measures were included, each assessed by the clinics as part of the initial evaluation: Level of cognitive disturbance was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Exam (Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975   ); level of patient functioning was assessed by the center nurse during a home visit using the Blessed Roth Dementia Rating Scale (Blessed, Tomlinson, and Roth 1968   ); number of psychiatric symptoms was based on the center psychiatrists' rating of 26 symptoms, using DSM-III criteria (American Psychiatric Association 1980   ); number of neurological signs was based on the center neurologists' rating of 10 motor, 5 involuntary movement, and 6 primitive reflex signs, using a standard protocol; number of other current health problems or illnesses was based on the center physicians' rating of 42 disorders, using a standard protocol after a physical history and examination; and number of patient problem management behaviors was based on the center nurses' interview with a family caregiver, using a standard protocol (range 0–10). A principal components analysis of the six measures yielded one factor, accounting for 67% of score variance. A factor score from this single component indexed patient severity. Characteristics of the Caregiving Setting. Three measures were included. (a) Pre-NHP frequency of use of professional community services was included because it was thought to reduce caregiver stress and burden, thus potentially reducing the need for NHP. Service utilization was defined as the number of regularly used services provided by professional and/or community programs during the 12 months prior to NHP. A standard list of 26 services (respite care, support groups, case management, homemaker services) was employed, and frequency of use was recorded. (b) Caregiver distress was assessed by asking each family member to rate the patient's behavior on a subjective 5-point scale of "troublesomeness," based on their distress in dealing with 17 patient problem behaviors (wandering, getting lost, asking the same question over and over, hiding things, being suspicious or accusative; alpha = .83). (c) Hours of caregiving per week also was assessed. Data Analysis We used a mixed-models, repeated measures linear regression procedure (SAS PROC MIXED; Khattree and Naik 1995   ) to analyze the impact of six between-subjects and one within-subjects (time) effects on family caregiver health and well-being: patient group (NHP, non-NHP), patient severity, caregiver gender, caregiver education, relationship of caregiver to patient, and use of professional services. This procedure permits inclusion of both within- and between-subjects effects and enables examination of each main and interaction effect simultaneously and independently of the other effects. We used the composite health and well-being score in this analysis to keep the number of comparisons to a minimum.Preliminary analyses indicated unacceptable levels of multicollinearity that could undermine the primary analysis. The mixed model analysis required that we drop caregiver distress because the variance attributable to it was already included in the remaining variables in the equation. One within-subjects effect was also included: time (baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after NHP). Because of the number and complexity of the interaction terms (all 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-way interactions), only 2- and 3-way terms were reviewed. Results Primary Findings The central hypothesis, that NHP leads to an improvement in caregiver health and well-being over time after controlling for all other factors, was tested by the two-way interaction of Patient group (NHP vs non-NHP) by Time ( Table 3  ). The nonsignificant F = .13 indicated that family caregiver health and well-being did not change over time as a function of placement. That is, changes in family caregiver health and well-being did not differ between NHP and non-NHP families across the 2 years following NHP.The remaining tests evaluated the effects of the qualifying or moderating variables (patient severity, caregiver gender, relationship of caregiver to patient, caregiver education, use of professional services) on the effects of NHP on caregiver health and well-being over time. These effects were evaluated by a set of three-way interactions that included a qualifying variable, plus Group (NHP, non-NHP), and Time. No three-way Group by Time by qualifier interaction term reached statistical significance. This indicated that none of the potential qualifying variables affected the Group by Time interaction term: NHP did not affect caregiver health and well-being over time regardless of patient severity, caregiver gender, caregiver education, use of professional services, and relationship to patient.The analyses reported so far included NHP patients who were institutionalized during the interval between clinic evaluation and 6 months postevaluation. A 6-month cutoff was used to permit sufficient time (24 months) to elapse to assess reactions to NHP. It could be the case, however, that those patients who were institutionalized within 6 months of clinic evaluation were particularly problematic or in other ways differed from patients institutionalized at other times during the 2 years following clinic evaluation. Therefore, we returned to our original cohort and identified a group of 117 patients who underwent NHP any time during the 2 years following clinic evaluation, and 152 patients who remained with their families in the community during that period. The original analyses were then repeated, using health and well-being scores before and after NHP as the outcome variables. Three analyses were run with the same main and interaction effects outlined above. Because this was a larger sample than the one employed in the mixed model analysis, we had sufficient power to disaggregate the composite index of health and well-being into its contributing scores: somatic symptoms, anxiety/depression, and well-being.Again testing the central hypothesis of the study, the two-way interaction of Group (NHP vs non-NHP) and Time was not significant in any of the three analyses (anxiety/depression, F = 1.04, df = 1, 253; somatic symptoms, F = 1.93; well-being, F = 2.40). Also, none of the three-way interactions among Group (NHP vs non-NHP), Time, and a qualifying variable reached statistical significance in any of the three equations. Thus, the same results occurred regardless of when NHP occurred and across all three health and well-being outcome variables. Additional Findings Of the seven main effects (six between subjects, one within subjects), only one reached statistical significance ( Table 3  ): Spouses reported significantly poorer health and well-being scores, compared to offspring and in-laws (F = 4.01, p = .02).Because this was a study of change over time in caregiver health and well-being, we next explored the two-way interactions between each of the between-subjects effects and time for both NHP and non-NHP groups combined. These effects indicated how well each primary variable predicted change in caregiver health and well-being over time. Only one significant two-way interaction effect occurred: Time by Caregiver gender (F = 3.77, p = .02). For both NHP and non-NHP groups combined, the health and well-being of all female family caregivers declined over time more than the health and well-being of all male family caregivers.We next explored the remaining three-way interactions with Time (both groups combined), and two reached statistical significance ( Table 3  ): Patient severity by Caregiver gender by Time (F = 3.84, p = .02), and Patient severity by Relationship by Time (F = 2.81, p = .02). The findings for both three-way interaction terms were similar. At high levels of patient severity, the health and well-being of both male and female family caregivers declined equally over time. However, at low levels of patient severity, the health and well-being of female family caregivers declined more than the health and well-being of male family caregivers over time for both patient groups combined. In the second significant three-way effect, the decline in health and well-being over time was equal for spouses, offspring, and in-laws, but only at high levels of patient severity. The health and well-being of spouses declined over time more than the health and well-being of other family members at low levels of patient severity. Thus, severity of patient deficit qualified the original two-way interactions between Caregiver gender and Time such that the effects occurred only at low levels of patient severity. Discussion Our findings, coupled with the findings from other studies reviewed previously, suggest that although NHP may relieve aspects of instrumental caregiving burden, NHP does not relieve the attendant emotional dysphoria that frequently accompanies the strain of caring for a patient with AD in a community setting. At its simplest level, these findings suggest the need for health professionals to prepare family members for the fact that this aspect of the relief they may seek following NHP may not be obtained.The findings also suggest that, overall, female family caregivers and spouses experience the greatest decline in health and well-being over time, compared to male caregivers and offspring and in-laws, respectively, regardless of whether or not the patient is institutionalized. These differences, however, are more pronounced for family members of patients with low disability than with high disability. It may be the case that a ceiling effect is reached at high levels of patient disability for all family members. The stresses of caring for a severely debilitated patient in the community may become maximized at some point in time.How may we account for the absence of a significant improvement in family caregiver health and well-being following placement? Several speculations are worthy of consideration. First, the reasons that lead a family to decide on NHP are complex and may go beyond a simple explanation based on the problems associated with managing a deteriorating patient. Although studies of factors that contribute to a decision to institutionalize have found significant, positive relationships between patient severity and NHP, the size of the relationship is reduced significantly when studies are limited to samples of patients living in the community and cared for by family members. Thus, it is not patient severity alone, or perhaps most predominantly, that accounts for why many families decide on NHP in the first place and, by extension, how they react to NHP over time.A series of studies that address the family context of patient management and decision making may provide a direction for understanding at least some of the dynamics underlying the effects of NHP on family members. Fisher and Lieberman 1999    used a longitudinal design with 164 patients with a diagnosis of AD and their three-generation families. They found that families that scored high on emotional closeness and on negative family feelings, and low on family problem-solving efficiency, institutionalized their ill elder at a significantly higher rate than families that scored in the opposite direction; this finding held even after controlling for a host of other potentially influential variables, including patient severity and demographics. These family characteristics accounted for substantially more variance in predicting NHP than both the severity of the patient's deficit and the amount of strain experienced by the caregivers. If some family caregivers' distress is a product of close family processes and relationships, then the solution offered by NHP is unlikely, in itself, to offer relief. Thus, the context of the family decision-making setting and the inherent history of positive and negative family relationships may account for greater variation in changes in caregiver health and well-being following NHP than the variables we explored in the present research.This line of thinking is advanced by a study by Mittleman, Ferris, Shulman, Steinberg, and Levin 1996   , who used a family psycho-education technique with families of patients with AD and then provided ongoing family care over time. The intervention included education about the disease and experience addressing the personal and family relationship changes that occur when caring for an elderly patient with an increasingly debilitating disease over time. Compared to controls, their findings indicated improved family member well-being over time and, most importantly, a significant delay in NHP. Again, qualities of the family context of caregiving played a significant role in family member health, well-being, and decisions to institutionalize.A second line of reasoning concerns the important influence of caregiver bereavement. It is often assumed that many of the negative effects of caregiving are attributable to the emotional side effects of providing care. An additional explanation is that considerable distress among caregivers is attributable to a recognition of the impending "psychological" and physical death of a very close family member. Several studies (Garner 1997   ; Jones and Martinson 1992   ; Ponder and Pomeroy 1996   ; Walker and Pratt 1991   ) have suggested that an understanding of the consequences of caregiving for a demented relative may be better understood by considering the construct of "anticipatory grief." One study, comparing the spouses of NHP and non-NHP AD patients, found that although most caregivers reported a reduction in the burden of care following the institutionalization of their spouses, most also experienced considerable grief, depression, and guilt regarding the loss of a strong emotional attachment. This explanation is consistent with the fact that most distress experienced by caregivers is psychological, and that the stronger the attachment between the patient and the caregiver, the greater the caregiver experience of loss. This view also gains support from our findings, in that spouses experienced the greatest decline in health and well-being over time, compared to other family members. Clinical Considerations A recent study found that health care professionals base their suggestions that families consider NHP for patients with dementia on two general criteria: the severity of the patient's functional deficit, and the degree of family caregiver burden (Lieberman and Fisher 1998   ). The same report, however, also found that these two criteria are not major contributors to a family's actual decision to institutionalize. Rather, the quality of family relationships and the efficiency of family decision making play a far greater role in this regard. Thus, there is a disjunction between health care professionals and families regarding the reasons for suggesting and deciding on NHP. The findings of the current research extend those of this earlier report by suggesting that severity of patient deficit and caregiver burden also may not uniformly affect the outcome of NHP on caregiver health and well-being.These findings can be translated into three sets of clinical considerations, when placed within the context of multigeneration families struggling to manage a major chronic health problem. First, the sources of distress that lead a family to consider NHP are multifaceted, and they may not be overtly obvious. It is important for health care professionals to evaluate the family setting carefully to identify the patterns and causes of distress that may lead a family to consider NHP, rather than to assume that the single cause is to relieve the stresses of caregiving. Likewise, reactions to NHP most likely are not related exclusively to pre-NHP patient severity and caregiver distress. Second, it is important to keep in mind that different family members experience the stresses of caregiving in different ways and to different degrees, and that reactions to NHP likewise are different. That is, the burdens of caregiving are not uniform among the several family members who provide care over time, both before and after NHP. Thus, it may be important to prepare family members, especially women and spouses, about the variety of reactions that may occur after NHP takes place. Third, the data suggest that emphasis be placed on considering caregivers within the broad family context of care, and understanding the burdens of caregiving as part of a set of family caregiving relationships (Fisher and Lieberman 1999   ; Lieberman and Fisher 1995b   , Lieberman and Fisher 1999a   , Lieberman and Fisher 1999b   ). This approach stands in contrast to considering only the primary caregiver.These findings suggest that the frequent focus on patient severity, caregiver strain, and the other variables that are important in the caregiving process should be broadened. Future research should also address how characteristics of the family context of care affect post-NHP family caregiver health and well-being over time.Practice ConceptsThe ForumBook Reviews  None  Table 1.

     Assisted Living Report. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has released a report on assisted living facilities as a part of its long-term project, the National Study of Assisted Living Facilities. This report examined assisted living facilities that provide either a high level of service or a high level of resident privacy, which represent about 40% of assisted living facilities nationwide. Among other results, the study found that most residents feel they were treated with respect and dignity by staff, but were concerned about staff turnover and availability. The report is available at  http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/hshp.htm . Census Bureau/Grandparent Caregivers. The Census Bureau has released the results of its American Community Survey, which is a new annual sampling of the U.S. population intended to provide accurate, up-to-date profiles of America's communities. One interesting finding is that 42% of grandparents who live in the same house as their grandchildren were responsible for the grandchildren. Moreover, about a third of these grandparents had been responsible for the grandchildren for at least 5 years. The findings contribute to a growing awareness of the caregiving role that grandparents are increasingly playing. More information is available at  www.census.gov/acs/www/ . Medicaid/Caregiver Project. DHHS has approved a Medicaid demonstration project in Colorado that will allow older and disabled people to manage their own care needs. The pilot program will provide funds that would have otherwise been paid to home health agencies directly to older people or the disabled who will then be able to direct their own care. These individuals will be able to recruit and hire caregivers to provide personal and skilled care services, and at times that are most convenient to them, such as evenings or weekends.

The DHHS Office of Inspector General has issued a report finding that the peer-review system used to investigate quality of care complaints by Medicare beneficiaries is ineffective and rarely punishes physicians and hospitals when poor care is provided. It recommends that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services provide beneficiaries with an effective complaint process by either fixing the current peer-review system or creating an entirely new system.
